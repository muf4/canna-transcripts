1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,719
now providing with an overview of

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,559
trichomes cannabinoids terpenes

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,309
clavinets

4
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:10,739
and cannabis is kind of a large

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,718
undertaking as a result I'm just going

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,849
to touch on some of the key aspects of

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,039
these and realize it they're much more

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,690
complex this will just give you that

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,150
general understanding of what these

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,340
different compounds are so starting with

11
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,469
trichomes these are small crystal like

12
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,390
structures that are produced that

13
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:29,250
produce the cannabinoids and turbines

14
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,710
they can be said to have an almost

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,558
translucent mushroom like appearance we

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,770
kind of see here and here these resident

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,229
glands are often sticky to the touch in

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,540
quality trifles equal a quality product

19
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:45,058
in cannabis these are extremely sticky

20
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,429
if a sunny do these trichomes are

21
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,589
capturing an insect here but you may be

22
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,750
more familiar trichomes on like a

23
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,300
hearing this kind of to like a tomato

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,558
plant that they occur typically for

25
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,308
cannabis we're looking at tricone

26
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,589
production under a microscope or a loop

27
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,929
to kind of magnify them because quality

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,130
trichomes typically directly correlate

29
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:10,290
to a quality product the cannabinoids

30
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:12,658
THC and the pronunciation here stands

31
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,930
for tetrahydrocannabinol this is the

32
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,400
compound that produces the euphoric high

33
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,750
typically associated with marijuana this

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,880
is what it looks like on a chemical

35
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,560
structure CBD or Kant cannabidiol is

36
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,798
does not have these intoxicating effects

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,409
of THC but has more potential use in the

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,020
pharmaceutical industry since what can

39
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,960
be classified as hemp as long as that

40
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:40,859
cannabis plant has less than 0.3 percent

41
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,408
THC from federal regulations terpenes

42
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,810
are volatile or aromatic oils that

43
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,939
impact flavor aroma and effects kind of

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,439
see them dripping here canvas does have

45
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:52,228
about a hundred forty different terpenes

46
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,669
identified but terpenes aren't not only

47
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:55,429
found in cannabis as we see in this

48
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,930
conifer resin these kind of pine trees

49
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,670
this are created by the same glands that

50
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,310
produce the cannabinoids it is the THC

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,099
in the CBD in addition to the terpenes

52
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,469
themselves it can also be an indirect

53
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:10,469
impact on how the body processes other

54
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:12,329
cannabinoids such as THC and CBD so they

55
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,800
themselves have some effects they can

56
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,310
also influence effects

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,830
other compounds flavonoids many exists

58
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,960
naturally in nature they primary produce

59
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,310
coloration or pigments to the plant to

60
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,070
help attract pollinators and offer

61
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,420
protection from damaging UV light if the

62
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,039
Cylons are probably most widely

63
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,949
recognized for their purple color so

64
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,209
just in purple cush could also add like

65
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:35,489
the purple mists and blue mists

66
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,010
blueberries poison ivy when it first

67
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,010
comes out will having these flavonoids

68
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:43,919
or specifically these anthocyanins to

69
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:46,530
help shield it from damaging UV or

70
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,569
intense sunlight and as it gets older it

71
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,939
will lose those pigments and have more

72
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,650
of that chlorophyll it's not well

73
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:54,750
documented which shows the possible

74
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,210
interactions with cannabinoids so they

75
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,860
may also to have some interactions

76
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,680
hopefully it gives you just a general

77
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,750
overview of these very complex products

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,159
that cannabis can produce so you can

79
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,000
understand at least a little bit of the

80
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,000
difference between them
