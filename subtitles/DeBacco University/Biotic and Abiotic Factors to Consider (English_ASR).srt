1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,839
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,080
going to go over biotic and abiotic

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,719
factors to consider providing with some

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,240
examples as well as allowing you to do

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,240
some exploration on your own

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,719
[Music]

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,079
all right let's go over some of these

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,759
factors to consider here so we're

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,278
talking about biotic versus abiotic

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,118
remember there's two main categories

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,439
here biotic is the living and that

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,759
stands for basically life abiotic is

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,600
non-living factors so those biotics are

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,000
all the living or once living things in

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
the environment and abe factors are all

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,600
the non-living things in the environment

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,679
so some quick examples of biotic factors

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,558
some pictures here people animals and

19
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,359
plants while the abiotic factors rocks

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,359
water air but also consider wind

21
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,519
temperature and light still fall under

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,878
the abiotic category

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,600
so if we look at this image here always

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:58,960
talking about abiotic or abiotic item in

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,719
this image and this would be biotic this

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,718
mushroom here

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,718
how about the waves of the ocean

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,799
hopefully you said abiotic

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,118
and then this rock in the foreground

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,439
here

31
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:18,239
rocks these minerals would be going on

32
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:21,199
the abiotic side

33
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,199
this wonderful dog caught in a mid jump

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
here would of course be

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,478
biotic

36
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:31,359
a strand of dna

37
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,640
deoxyribonucleic acid it would be

38
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,560
abiotic

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
looking hopefully not staring directly

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
at it at least outside directly at the

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,960
sun here

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,239
this sun would be an example of

43
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:47,199
abiotic i have a lot of

44
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,879
you know combustion going on there a lot

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,719
of fusion going on that would of course

46
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,118
be abiotic

47
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,118
ah the sand

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,840
sand of course being mineral based

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,479
abiotic

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,478
uh looking at this virus particle here

51
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:09,199
so for those that don't know viruses are

52
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:11,038
basically dna wrapped in a protein coat

53
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,359
and i put kind of a good question here

54
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,919
because looking at they can multiply

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,400
they can cause severe disease

56
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,839
so what category do you classify them as

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,760
that's something we'll talk about in

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,759
class

59
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,519
about this

60
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,199
initially it might look like a leaf but

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,439
this is actually an insect that has

62
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,958
developed over time to look like a leaf

63
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,639
now whether you saw it as a leaf or saw

64
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,759
as an insect you should classify it

65
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,119
still as

66
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,719
biotic

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
now all organisms are what biotic or

68
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,199
abiotic and simply put they are all

69
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,560
biotic there now we can classify them a

70
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,439
little bit further as producers

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,479
consumers or decomposers but all these

72
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,079
still fall into the category of biotic

73
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,238
so imagine you walk outside the school

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,160
list as many biotic and abec factors as

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,039
you can i suggest you take a quick

76
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,799
second pause the video here jot a couple

77
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,359
of those down in each of those

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,360
respective categories

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,480
all right hopefully you did that and

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,519
going through and what are some of the

81
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,518
things you came up for uh biotic factors

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,039
living things you came up with and

83
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,840
hopefully some things maybe on your list

84
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,158
were trees grass birds people maybe

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,239
someone walking their dog as far as your

86
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,598
abiotic list goes you know

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,360
looking at that column hopefully that

88
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,878
you have created well those would be

89
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
kind of the school building light poles

90
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,679
houses cars sidewalks but don't forget

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,599
about sunlight temperature wind things

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,439
of those nature as well

93
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,399
so what are all the biotic and

94
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,680
items in this kind of unique image there

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
so i'll come up with kind of look at the

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,640
foreground here the background just a

97
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,439
little bit there what are some of the

98
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,039
biotic and abiotic things there i hope

99
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,799
we can make a quick little list there

100
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,959
just some more practice there kind of a

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,680
unique image i think

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,438
so um next little trial here you're

103
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,000
going to have 15 seconds to generate as

104
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,919
many uh abiotic and biotic factors as

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
you can for the image you're about to

106
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,039
see no it's not this picture i'm going

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,000
to step out so it doesn't look like i'm

108
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,919
staring at you for the 15 seconds uh but

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,719
you're going to have 15 seconds to look

110
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:14,199
at this image so get ready

111
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,199
and get set

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,478
all right and that one's time there so

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,879
hopefully you came up with a list and

114
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,918
you can uh take a look and uh compare

115
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,439
that uh in a class as well i can always

116
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,079
go back and

117
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,478
review it and hope you adhere to the 15

118
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,879
seconds there and pause the video and

119
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,560
cheat the system a little bit there but

120
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,319
so the question is you know everything

121
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,879
we looked at here do biotic and imac

122
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,319
factors affect each other

123
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,918
and this is kind of a question of you

124
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,159
know can these two kind of independent

125
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,079
categories have an impact on each other

126
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,680
and things you want to consider is if

127
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,079
there wasn't water in an area can

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,079
anything really grow and survive

129
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,240
or if you have an extremely cold winter

130
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:14,319
in those locations will affect animal

131
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,800
populations in the following spring year

132
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,478
so there are interactions that do occur

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
so your biotic factors living factors

134
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,240
that affect other organisms or shapes

135
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,360
the environment so back factors could be

136
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
predation

137
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,720
food availability competition and

138
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,720
disease or about factors those

139
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,880
temperatures light intensity water soil

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,360
ph mineral content gases

141
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,719
those non-factors can also affect

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
organisms

143
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
so it just does get very complex

144
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,758
depending on how much you want to get

145
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,079
into it but remember there are many

146
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,120
interactions that occur each impacted by

147
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,839
a variety of biotic and abiotic factors

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
with consumers producers you've got

149
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,439
primary

150
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,079
secondary and tertiary kind of consumers

151
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,439
all playing in to the great food web and

152
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,758
hopefully this took a very simple

153
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,240
category of just abec and

154
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,080
biotic factors and gave you a little bit

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,560
greater appreciation for the

156
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:07,839
complexities involved with just this

157
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,839
classification system
