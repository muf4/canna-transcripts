1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
okay here I'm going to explain the

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,818
triangulation method how it relates

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,318
typically to crime scenes and

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,029
particularly to sketches and

5
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:09,718
documentation of where things might be

6
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:11,718
located

7
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,759
some of the information I got was from

8
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:17,669
Ashland up Pierson that the web site

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,039
found here at SlideShare so starting

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,020
with triangulation method let's look at

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,368
what is this about well first off and

12
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,679
want to Train Lee anything we need to

13
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:28,079
have fixed points we have areas of

14
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,910
reference or to measure off of there's

15
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,469
no set saying of what has to be a fixed

16
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,750
point typically we're using the larger

17
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:36,030
objects these fixed points act as

18
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,950
accurate measurements that must be

19
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,950
recorded so that the scale of the

20
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,359
finalized sketch can be prepared for

21
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,559
presentation so we have these fixed

22
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,500
points and that's what's allowing us to

23
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,859
establish this area and act as points

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,179
that we can then measure off of in from

25
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:55,109
so looking at the triangulation method

26
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:58,109
of locating evidence well here an item a

27
00:00:55,109 --> 00:01:00,210
is 10 feet in southeast corner of the

28
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,059
room and 815 the southwest corner of the

29
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,500
room SUNY North is this way these

30
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:08,099
measurements will always intersect at

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,978
Point A's location so now what we're

32
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,239
looking at and going through

33
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:16,519
triangulation with Ella fixed items so

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:19,890
now how we triangulate for Part A here

35
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:22,019
so evidence must be translated with two

36
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,210
fixed points how would object a be

37
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,670
triangulated not from using the corners

38
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,259
of the rooms we have our desk here we're

39
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,670
looking at transition without that fixed

40
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,170
point so the desk is not fixed since is

41
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,280
that touching the walls located and has

42
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,769
not been determined

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,400
so a desk needs to be fixed in space we

44
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:43,078
have to measure that to start here it is

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,340
one inch from the on this wall I'm three

46
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:46,169
feet from this wall providing the

47
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,299
measurements the desk is not fixed in

48
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,579
space now object a can be fixed to the

49
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,710
two fixed points of the desk now we've

50
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,199
established where that desk is now we

51
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,578
can measure from there

52
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,350
so I'm decay can now be fixed from the

53
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,389
two fixed points from the desk as

54
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:01,978
depicted and the above the sketch five

55
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,290
feet from here and six feet from here

56
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:08,098
now we've established where that desk is

57
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,629
located now progressing to object flush

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,978
to the wall I would after they be

59
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,689
trained over the desk that's flush to

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,770
the wall well because it's flush to the

61
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,969
wall we don't have to measure about

62
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,400
find it you can measure its distance

63
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:19,530
from this wall and we can now take our

64
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,789
two fixed points from the corner one

65
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,710
motion is required to place the desk

66
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:24,269
along the wall plus it's flush with the

67
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,590
wall making it fixed and then the object

68
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:30,750
is translated as usual how it was flush

69
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,670
to both walls if it stuffed in the

70
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,110
corner how do we do that well we don't

71
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:36,119
dis tablished a desk at all we can just

72
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,190
measure from those corners of that desk

73
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,439
to get the triangulation where point a

74
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,430
is located

75
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,960
once evidence of training that it can be

76
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,969
a fixed point to train the other items

77
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,490
from so if evidence a was here to

78
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:49,139
evidence B we can work also from that

79
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,770
fixed point to this circuit point in

80
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:55,769
this case object B so the rectangular

81
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,420
coordinate method we see here nice kind

82
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,980
of coordinating things were object a and

83
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,349
B might be located it's another great

84
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:04,019
way right angles to again from the wall

85
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,939
and distance from the wall center of

86
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,590
mass so what does this refer to well

87
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,870
I've had to do with blood splatter or

88
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,129
some other forms of liquids how are we

89
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,870
dealing with that or how are we going to

90
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,189
measure those who can measure each three

91
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,990
of those in this case when I get a

92
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:18,359
couple more well we're gonna measure to

93
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,310
what's called the center of mass so

94
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,650
since blood droplets are no particular

95
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,039
defined shape they are trained from the

96
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,240
center of mass what does that mean well

97
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,829
this is our blood spatter were kind of

98
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,450
estimating the center to be right there

99
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,969
and that's what we're trained leading

100
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:35,869
from not any one particular droplet or

101
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:38,310
from the center of that massive there

102
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,659
unless we have a projection sketch so we

103
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,189
see all the data that's included all the

104
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,709
details or the translation that's

105
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:46,199
included the legend of what the letters

106
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,759
correlate and where north is located now

107
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,259
it's not the scale or you could say that

108
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,870
quarter inch equals a foot whatever fits

109
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,519
the conditions here we can see the level

110
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,980
of detail that's seen in the sketch and

111
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,490
many times training missions are trained

112
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:01,469
the triangle relation method is used to

113
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,620
do know for example where the bolt hole

114
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:07,609
is in relation to the walls to get an

115
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,989
idea where that's located to be used and

116
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,989
shown in courtroom settings
