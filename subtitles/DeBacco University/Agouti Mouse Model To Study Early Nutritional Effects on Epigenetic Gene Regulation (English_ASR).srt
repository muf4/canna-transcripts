1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,678
despite these mice looking very

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,278
differently they are actually

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,800
genetically the same in this debacco

4
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:10,559
University video the Audy Mouse model to

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,280
study early nutritional effects on

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,718
epigenetic Gene regulation will be

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:20,759
discussed on how the uh nutrition of the

8
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,759
mother can potentially impact the future

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,079
[Music]

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,640
Offspring all right let's get into this

11
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:34,320
ay Mouse model now there's a great

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,480
YouTube video to kind of go over um and

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,000
help explain some of this I'm going to

14
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,038
try to break this down uh so we can

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,280
relate this mouse model potentially to

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,558
something that was also seen in humans

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,600
so first off since we're going to talk

18
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,718
about epigenetic should probably

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,679
describe what this actually is and Epi

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,480
uh genetic literally means in addition

21
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,960
to changes in genetic sequence so this

22
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,038
is not looking at just gen sequence

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,280
we're looking at additional

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,239
modifications to that the term has to

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,879
involve to evolve to include the process

26
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:05,280
that alters gene activity without

27
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,079
changing the actual DNA sequence and

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,359
leads to modifications that can be

29
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,679
transmitted to daughter cells there will

30
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,438
like this there likely will continue to

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
be debate over exactly what the term

32
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,758
means and what it covers but this gives

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,159
you a good understanding many types of

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,319
epigenetic processes have been

35
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,478
identified we're going to look

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,319
specifically at methylation um here and

37
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,920
describe a little bit more about that

38
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,758
it's basically methyl groups added to

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,840
DNA sequences um and the epigenetic

40
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,840
process are natural and essential to

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,118
many organisms functions but if they

42
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,920
occur improperly there can be major

43
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:40,040
adverse Health as well as behavioral uh

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,280
impacts and effects perhaps the best

45
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,680
known epigenetic process in part U for

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,399
methylation uh has been methylation

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,880
because it's in addition to removing the

48
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,879
methyl group it's pretty easy to

49
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,359
identify um and it really um provides

50
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,959
this initial investigation while other

51
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,200
things can apply we're going to look

52
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:00,718
specifically at methylation it was first

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,079
con uh confirmed to occurr in human

54
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,078
cancer in 1983 making of utmost um

55
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,079
importance there for illnesses and

56
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,758
health

57
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,800
conditions so looking at this kind of uh

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,159
example here well it stems from the

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
second world war in the winter of 1944

60
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,039
to

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
1945 there was a German blockade that

62
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,318
caused famine in the in Western

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,760
provinces of the Netherlands a legacy

64
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,560
longitudinal study five decades later or

65
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:28,439
after this had occurred showed that

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,439
people born to mothers who were in the

67
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,680
first 3 months of pregnancy during the

68
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,878
famine had significantly higher

69
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,200
instances of obesity diabetes

70
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,799
cardiovascular disease and cancer in

71
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,238
their adult lives this led to the

72
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,519
development of the hypothesis called

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,959
fetal susceptibility traditional

74
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,560
genetics really couldn't explain what

75
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,719
was going on here um however in 2003 a

76
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,439
study conducted uh by two scientists uh

77
00:02:52,719 --> 00:03:00,239
Robert Waterland and Randy jle uh with

78
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:02,359
mice May provide some supporting um data

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
um to this and I included a citation to

80
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,599
their study and describe a little bit

81
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:10,119
more of kind of what they found and how

82
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:13,238
it relates so this fetal susceptibility

83
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,920
hypothesis um it's traditional genetics

84
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,360
really couldn't explain kind of what was

85
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:20,000
going on here and the concept is that

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,799
some of these um you know effects seen

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,919
in The Offspring could be connected to

88
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,879
potentially um other factors from the um

89
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,479
prenatal stage uh and kind of the mother

90
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,598
maternal diet

91
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,759
and that famine during that critical

92
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:36,318
development time period of the fetus may

93
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,079
have caused some developmental

94
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,958
modifications that then led to the

95
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,239
predisposition to obesity and

96
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,438
cardiovascular diseases later in life

97
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,680
that's what they looked at with this

98
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:49,959
model so it's brings us to the Audi mice

99
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,200
here um Audi simply means um you know

100
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,479
large yellow Audi mice it demonstrated

101
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,639
the fetal susceptibility and opened up a

102
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,399
new way to look at genetics genetic

103
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,878
mutations were thought to be the cause

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,319
of diseases and in some cases they can

105
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,959
be and while this may be the case it's

106
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,359
not the only case that may occur so

107
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,959
we're looking at our mice here from the

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,079
title side image and another one right

109
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,000
here both of these mice are genetically

110
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,239
identical they're the same but the

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,918
phenotypes are very different so we're

112
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,198
looking how the genotype impacts the

113
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,560
phenotype and vice versa here what's

114
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,439
going on here how can they have the same

115
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,240
genes but have very different looks or

116
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:28,918
morphological features so I kind of Rel

117
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,038
to the kitchen analogy we got the genome

118
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,519
is like the recipe The genome contains

119
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,399
the blueprint for making maintaining the

120
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,000
organism that's kind of the set standard

121
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,439
set of instructions then the epig genome

122
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,199
is the chef uh when in where and how to

123
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,519
make it work the epome provides the

124
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,000
regulation of those Gene Expressions so

125
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,159
the chef comes in and they're going to

126
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,560
make decisions meaning if they're

127
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,639
looking at you know making a breakfast

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,439
they're probably more likely going to

129
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,280
choose the um recipes for pancakes and

130
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,719
muffins and eggs if they looking at

131
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,519
dinner they might choose something more

132
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,639
in the you know steak rice and and salad

133
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,719
there so it's kind of U izing The genome

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,400
which is the recipe the epome is a chef

135
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,880
that's directing where and when it's

136
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,239
being utilized so we're looking at the

137
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,839
importance of Gene regulation

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,280
methylation comes into play and that's

139
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,560
the um ch3 can block or turn off or

140
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,478
silence different genes we see that

141
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,600
molecule right here see the methyl

142
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,240
groups attached right here each cell

143
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,400
contains all of your DNA a few

144
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,160
exceptions for example red blood cells

145
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,638
but look very different so if you think

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,600
of your skin cells versus your liver

147
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,879
cells very different um looks very

148
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,720
different functions but contain the same

149
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,879
genes uh this is simply due to the

150
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,840
expression of or what genes are being

151
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,600
expressed in those cells for example

152
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,519
your eye cells contain the gentics to

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,120
produce hydrochloric acid however it's a

154
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,719
good thing this Gene is not expressed in

155
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,600
your eyes but that Gene is activated

156
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,039
where it's needed in your

157
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,759
stomach so this brings nature versus

158
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,918
nurture um into you know uh comparison

159
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,759
as well or debate early in development

160
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:58,478
signals are given to differentiate cells

161
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,840
and these signals are carried on as the

162
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,199
organism grows in and develops the

163
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,439
genetic signals can be influenced byal

164
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,680
environmental factors stress and diet

165
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,719
and this leads to environmental

166
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,199
epigenetics at critical stages of

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,759
development the environmental factors

168
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,240
can have a greater influence on the

169
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,840
final gene expression of the individual

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,400
shortly after fertilization is a

171
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,758
critical time point is this is when

172
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,318
cells first are developing famine in

173
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,879
those mothers while early in pregnancy

174
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,960
impacted development of their fetus and

175
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,879
again we're looking at fertilization the

176
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,879
form of the zygote the two cell the four

177
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,000
cell the eight cell age very very early

178
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,319
on on how if something occurs during

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,720
this stage it could really impact uh

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,120
what genes are being

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,080
expressed now this agui Gene going back

182
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,000
to this all mammals have the agui gene

183
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,159
that controls the distribution of dark

184
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,759
pigment and go back to our genetically

185
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,039
identical mice here some brown and the

186
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,960
are brown and they stay normal weight

187
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,918
their entire life some are the tan

188
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,680
yellow color and they are obese and have

189
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,120
high instances of diabetes and cancer

190
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,918
the differences are due to changes in

191
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,759
that Gene expression the change is real

192
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,079
transposon which is a viral segment of

193
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
DNA that moves or jumps to different

194
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,000
positions in the genome and that can

195
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,560
alter gene expression so that transpose

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
on we can see here taking that sequence

197
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,800
and just cutting it out and moving it

198
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,199
over here well it's been physically

199
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,360
moved in space and that what's that's

200
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,439
what can cause this change in gene

201
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,199
expression we also have the presence of

202
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,319
methyl groups you know when we have uh

203
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,199
methyl groups being added or removed

204
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,800
that can also affect the um expression

205
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,319
or the suppression of that particular um

206
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,520
Gene so here we see the Audi type here

207
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,120
um in our you know nonmethylated groups

208
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,279
and we see that being expressed and we

209
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,000
see that yellow obese and tumor causing

210
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,679
when we see methyl groups blocking the

211
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,639
promoter region blocking that Gene we'll

212
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,560
see that normal normal weight and that

213
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,478
brown

214
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,240
coloration now those tan yellow mice um

215
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:52,959
the transposon physically located right

216
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,680
next to the agui gene we can see again

217
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,158
that same example right here uh an over

218
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,120
production resulting in the tan yellow

219
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,839
coloration and also block the feeding

220
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,079
control Center in the brain so kind of

221
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:06,119
two things were occurring this results

222
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:08,639
them in being obese and this is also

223
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,199
inheritable T have a greater percentage

224
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,360
of similar offspring that would become

225
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,280
obese early and unfortunately get sick

226
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,080
so we see in the neurom methylation that

227
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,758
blocking that goody Gene normal weight

228
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,399
TN coloration and that nonmethyl group

229
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,038
that Gene would then be expressed

230
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,598
leading to that yellow coloration and

231
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:29,598
that unfortunately developing higher

232
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,838
instances of diabetes and overweight

233
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,838
so can the phenotype be changed

234
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:35,679
environmentally well the tanelle mothers

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,959
were split into two groups in the part

236
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,519
of the experiment um and they had an

237
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,199
experimental group and a control group

238
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,080
the experimental group of mouse or fed

239
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,519
uh Mouse Chow rich in methyl groups

240
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,839
there um which contain folic acid

241
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,240
chlorine vitamin B12 and these provide

242
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,760
methyl groups which are involved in gene

243
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,959
regulation the control group was fed

244
00:08:53,759 --> 00:09:00,278
just regular Mouse gel so with these

245
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:02,199
originally umy m

246
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:04,559
when they're fed this diet we can see a

247
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,720
change here a percentage change the

248
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,559
experimental group mothers have more

249
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,639
normal or brown mouse Offspring compared

250
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,119
to the control group indicating those

251
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,559
Audi mothers that were fed those High

252
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,440
methyl groups those methyl groups were

253
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,958
put uh on the genes to block that Audi

254
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,880
Gene and they resulted in more normal

255
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,958
mice that occur so it's just showing how

256
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,838
the environment can affect the gene

257
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,599
expression imp fact of that Mother's

258
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,240
diet again just to reiterate it here the

259
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
incorporation of those methyl groups uh

260
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,159
the feed essentially silence or turned

261
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,639
off the transpose on this results in a

262
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:39,759
return to the normal umy Gene with mice

263
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,278
being Brown and of normal weight the

264
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,000
unmethylated early uh in development

265
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:46,200
results in the activation of the Audi

266
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,519
Gene through the animals entire cells

267
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,839
and that's continuous throughout the

268
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,278
life in the animal always being yellow

269
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,680
so once expressed early on continues

270
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:55,360
this is the first study connect a

271
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,519
mother's diet to impact on the

272
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,919
expression of the offspring's genetic

273
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,039
code it was kind of a breakthrough and

274
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,559
is still talked about even to this day

275
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,799
now this leads to the epigenetics which

276
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,359
is the mechanism by which the

277
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:09,639
environment can affect the expression of

278
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,879
genes which can alter disease

279
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,000
susceptibility obesity may be impacted

280
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,159
by nourishment of the mother received

281
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,519
before the baby was even born so what

282
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,240
environmental factors change the

283
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,560
epigenome what are the genes that are

284
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,159
being altered these are all questions

285
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:26,359
that we have however now we do have the

286
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,159
tools and know what we're looking for so

287
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,600
several studies of the umbilical cord of

288
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,439
newborn babies found that lower

289
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,600
methylate levels in the

290
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,639
cdkn2a gene that regulates fat cells was

291
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,240
associated with greater fat tissue in

292
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,680
the child at 4 years old and increasing

293
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,560
their obesity risk later in life so

294
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,199
again this is showing another connection

295
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,958
between the prenatal stage and diet and

296
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,560
impact the mother has on the developing

297
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:53,439
fetus to how that Offspring uh has later

298
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,278
um traits The Offspring has later in

299
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,920
life so what's the research you know

300
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:58,278
results what are the impacts of these

301
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,199
well it has changed how we view the

302
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:01,958
adult disease secep ability for some

303
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,519
cases and has entered the term

304
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,399
epigenetics into vocabulary this has

305
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,519
impacted research in nutrition drug

306
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,639
Discovery infectious diseases as well as

307
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,078
genetics genome alterations are

308
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,440
difficult though crisper is helping with

309
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:17,239
this but epig genome alterations may be

310
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,760
easier once identified and small changes

311
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,680
in nutrition can alter disease

312
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,679
setability not through alterations of

313
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,559
the genome but by altering the epig

314
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,319
genome it might be more susceptible or

315
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,559
might be more easier to be received by

316
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,760
the public to help their potential

317
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,078
future offs

318
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,919
spring so the environmental impacts on

319
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:36,278
the genomes environmental impacts can

320
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,439
reprogram genetic inheritance for better

321
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,720
or worse so we're expanding this model

322
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,800
out from just the genes and the

323
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,800
environment making you to the genes uh

324
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,240
the environment and also the epigenetics

325
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,319
playing into this kind of Trifecta to

326
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,879
make you you and to see kind of what you

327
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,519
may be more likely to be predisposed of

328
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,519
not saying family histry doesn't play a

329
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,679
role but family history is a part of it

330
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,039
as well as the environment and

331
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:01,479
nutritions um exercise and lifestyle

332
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,958
that you have as well as the epigenetics

333
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,839
as well as a new consideration um as

334
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,399
this

335
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,000
Trifecta however lastly just the counter

336
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,000
point here uh during reproduction demain

337
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,278
cells tend to go through two full cycles

338
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
of demethylation that process strips of

339
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,720
all methyl groups and thus epigenetic

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,879
information from germ and embryotic cell

341
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,040
so germ are basically sex cells to date

342
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,078
there's no evidence that epigenetic

343
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:26,360
Transformations can survive two rounds

344
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,599
of biochemical cleansing and what that

345
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,720
refers to is kind of the image here if

346
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
the original

347
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,278
um if the grandmother who smokes is

348
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,399
altering potentially their own epome

349
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:38,720
could also affect the baby that they

350
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,720
have and if the baby's developing those

351
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,000
germ cells at the same time and it

352
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,278
impacts those cells now only do we have

353
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,440
the original grandmother's Offspring

354
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,000
affected you can see more obese here but

355
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,639
potentially their offspring could be

356
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,879
affected however looking at this process

357
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,839
we're not looking at kind of this

358
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:59,198
multi-generation jump but definitely a

359
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,079
correlation here of mother to initial

360
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:03,439
Offspring there so again just something

361
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:05,078
to keep in mind and something for

362
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,279
expecting mothers to keep in mind during

363
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,759
that critical stage of development to

364
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,799
definitely uh be mindful of nutrition

365
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,600
because it could have potential impacts

366
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:15,599
on your unborn child
