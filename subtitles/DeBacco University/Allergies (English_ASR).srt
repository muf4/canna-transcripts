1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,690
okay here okay a very brief overview of

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:08,699
allergies now keep in mind this is a

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:12,030
highly variable based on the individual

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:15,119
some people may be allergic to here or

5
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:17,429
dander so may be allergic to nuts of

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,350
some kind tree nuts or peanuts so may be

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,839
allergic to pollen and there's a whole

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,810
host of other things but we kind of all

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,480
have that same Ivy's end result where we

10
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:30,829
have that have itchy eyes running nose

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,230
in this general kind of not feeling well

12
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:36,329
so when clipping becomes harassment so

13
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:38,640
what are allergies well allergies in the

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,070
general sense are when the body mounts a

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,929
major defense against a harmless

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,700
substance that's what the whole point

17
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:48,659
about allergies is about so we have that

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,270
itchy eyes runny nose swelling and this

19
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,558
major defense despite the substance

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,390
that's reacting to being completely

21
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,209
harmless hay fever

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,799
and houston testaments are examples

23
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,570
during the allergic reaction process

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,729
mast cells initiate the inflammatory

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,338
response they release histamine

26
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:08,670
capillaries swell and mucus production

27
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:10,920
will increase an example of this too

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,170
would be asthma and asthma histamines

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,960
cousin nearing of air passages in the

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,400
lungs this can be very serious we cut

31
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,250
off the air passages or there's too much

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,500
swelling we can eliminate the body's

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,549
ability to breathe and essentially get

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,500
air in or out of the lungs nestlÃ©'s and

35
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,829
dalton allergies will mast cells are a

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,840
main component of the allergic response

37
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:36,179
ecology such as pollen are related to

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,609
the antibody known as IgE I have a

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,970
separate video and over antibodies like

40
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:44,159
other antibodies IgE antibody is very

41
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:47,039
specific and it's very important for all

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,740
of our antibodies here one acts against

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,430
oak pollen the other acts against ranked

44
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:56,129
ragweed so we have that very high degree

45
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,680
of specificity that does occur the first

46
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:01,408
time in allergy prone person runs across

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,600
and allergens such as ragweed here he or

48
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,420
she makes large amounts of ragweed IgE

49
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,090
antibodies these IgE molecules attach

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,679
themselves to the mast cells the second

51
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,259
time the person has a brush was Bradley

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,770
the IgE prime mast cells release green

53
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:16,109
rose

54
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,300
powerful chemical known as histamine and

55
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,340
cytokines and leads into the environment

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,950
and as a result that chemical mediators

57
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,560
cause the characteristic symptoms of an

58
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:27,780
allergy here is a prime example or the

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,020
sequence of steps that your body goes

60
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,360
through mounting an allergic reaction to

61
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:36,240
initially a piece of ragweed pollen that

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,970
really is benign and does not have any

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,260
serious health threats so that's kind of

64
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:41,819
the whole point of the allergies here

65
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,459
your bodies and mounting this high-end

66
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,659
immune response for a basically a

67
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,659
harmless substance
