00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,880
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,640
where i'm going to cover how to set up a

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,679
grow tent for cannabis production

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,759
i'm going to walk you through the

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,160
process that i went through to set up

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,480
this

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,679
sun hut grow tent uh the big and easy

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,280
i'll kind of walk you through the

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,879
process starting with taking everything

10
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,640
out of the package here

11
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,799
and setting it up that ultimately

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,679
received the canvas plan so hope you

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:30,219
enjoy

14
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:33,250
this video

15
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:33,250
[Music]

16
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,558
here we'll be setting up the sun systems

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,680
big and easy

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:46,718
grow tent this size here is two feet by

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,079
four feet

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,079
and we're going to see how easy it is to

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,920
assemble

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,840
all right and here we're looking at the

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,000
instructions so always good to

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,680
have these handy look at them ahead of

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,759
time make sure you get your parts list

26
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,840
make sure you have some idea of assembly

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,439
and in this case make sure you have the

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,159
right grow tent instructions that you're

29
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,798
following

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
so there's those list of materials now

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,000
here is them all

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,118
here they all are spread out just

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,519
checking to make sure

34
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,359
we have everything before we begin so

35
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,798
now we're not missing anything which can

36
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,478
be a very frustrating part of the

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,880
process but luckily here everything was

38
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,879
present

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,720
okay i've organized that with the bottom

40
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,319
being down on this end

41
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,840
and this area here is the top also i've

42
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,359
taken all the poles out

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,680
and you can see that they're nicely

44
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:37,759
organized

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,520
so these are all my number ones

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,159
to the number twos and then over here

47
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,158
i've put my

48
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,798
number threes also so this keeps

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,320
everything nice and organized

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,159
i'm going through and simply following

51
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,078
the instructions here

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,000
for the 2x4 size okay so what i did is i

53
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,798
went through

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,239
attached all the corners there opened up

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,320
the whole bottom

56
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,478
fit it right in you'll notice this is

57
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,359
the top all unzipped so a little messy

58
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:08,878
right now

59
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,038
but we're gonna work on building the

60
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,919
upper sections so that we can start to

61
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,719
have the grow tent

62
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,479
come together okay working on installing

63
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,598
the upper ones here

64
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,598
start giving it some height

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,039
there's the base building up here on the

66
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,759
vertical

67
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,439
need to put one of these connectors

68
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,840
insert that

69
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,519
right on top of there taking our next

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,878
bowl number three

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,759
putting it in there to get us to our

72
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,598
near final height now

73
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,199
go through and we'll do the rest so i've

74
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,079
gone through and attached these

75
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,878
here after we attach those you can see

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
we're

77
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,479
putting on the other bars and slowly

78
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,359
forming

79
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,119
the rest of the structure so now we've

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,640
got the basic frame for the entire

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,719
structure built

82
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,799
the way up supporting at the top now we

83
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:03,039
just have to take the covering

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,239
and put it over the supporting structure

85
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,560
so now for the most part it's all

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,239
assembled key part is you want to make

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
sure that all the corners are nice and

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
snug

89
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,158
and tight to give it a nice structure

90
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,079
and support

91
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,199
there now we got a couple more things to

92
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,480
do but

93
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,359
kind of the hardest and most struggle

94
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,359
part is done

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,439
okay so when we're installing the

96
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,479
vertical supports we want to make sure

97
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,439
we have these

98
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,039
in the down position you can see here

99
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,519
and then we're running the other support

100
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,679
ones in this way in the up position

101
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,560
what this allows is this overlap to

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,400
occur

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,000
so that when we're gonna hang something

104
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,360
between our such as our lights and

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,680
carbon filter

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,640
creates a much stronger uh structure

107
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,439
here

108
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,399
so again organizing your upper supports

109
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,079
correctly

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,158
can help ensure that you can hang some

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,120
weight off it and everything will hold

112
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,120
together just fine

113
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,199
so at the bottom of the grow tent make

114
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,039
sure we install this in liner to catch

115
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,438
any water that might spill out

116
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,598
just simply just hold it twice right

117
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,840
here and go through and attach it with

118
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,759
velcro to the poles here tape this

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,000
inside to keep everything nice

120
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,759
and contained in case we do have some

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,358
water leaking out it will not leave the

122
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,639
grow tent and spill those surrounding

123
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,638
area

124
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,879
so on this grow tent there's a screen

125
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,960
here a fine mesh screen for ventilation

126
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,079
it's also a viewing area they also make

127
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,638
these velcro

128
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,240
reflective mylar pieces at one place to

129
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,199
block that out if we want to you can

130
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,519
help seal that up

131
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,639
right there allow us to open it later if

132
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,680
we want

133
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,879
i also have great ports here for

134
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,759
power exhaust fans so we can also

135
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,959
through

136
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,360
inside if we look i also have the

137
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,719
ability to kind of seal those up here

138
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,040
this is that screen port that we just

139
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,360
blocked off and this will have an

140
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,479
area we can pull tight when we install

141
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,080
our cords

142
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,319
and here's our finally assembled grow

143
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,879
tent recommends it to people

144
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,879
be a little easier at times or two but i

145
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,120
did it with just one person

146
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,038
so it is possible you can kind of see at

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,079
least how initially

148
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,319
the general setup looks in here and

149
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,519
looking good this route and adding a

150
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,000
couple more um

151
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,719
options to it so they can support some

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,279
plants

153
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,880
for growing it's nice about the 2x4 size

154
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,918
fits right through a doorway so if

155
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,199
you're going through and put it in one

156
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,439
area and go into another

157
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,639
it'll go right through a standard door

158
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:38,879
as we have here

159
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:40,960
without need for disassembly

160
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,959
you
