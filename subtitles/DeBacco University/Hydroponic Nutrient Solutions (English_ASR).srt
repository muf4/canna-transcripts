1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,310
so while this short video lecture here

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:07,710
focuses on hydroponic nutrient solutions

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:11,428
many of the same concepts can be applied

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,929
to nutrient solutions in general for no

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,388
matter what you're feeding even in soil

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,670
of media so hydroponic nutrients

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:20,009
solutions the goal of those are designed

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,810
to be a red elite plant available with

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,109
precise control over plants can flower

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:27,629
faster and reduce the overall production

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,060
time compared to soil based operations

12
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:33,030
so these nutrient solutions are designed

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,219
to supply the plants with nutrients that

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,530
are available very quickly as a result

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,210
especially with hydroponics want to be

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,129
mindful of the pH that we are creating

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,719
within that solution to make sure not

18
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,119
only is it being directly applied to the

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,489
plants and available very quickly but in

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,399
the pH range that helps or facilitates

21
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:52,169
that uptake now if you have water

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
evaporating at a high rate this can lead

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,340
to a more concentrated solution so be

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,570
mindful of this if you have an area

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,180
that's open like we saw on the previous

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,579
image here this can cause evaporation to

27
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,960
increase quicker as a result that can

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,820
cause a more concentrated solution

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,010
because the water will be evaporating

30
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,408
out but the nutrients will be remaining

31
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,630
behind as a result with less volume of

32
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,479
water the concentration level will go up

33
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:17,009
so good growers should be topping off

34
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,109
the containers with water to dilute that

35
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,599
solution so that you're maintaining the

36
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,810
proper ppm for delivering to the plants

37
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,759
so a water miner comes into place also

38
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,409
good growers are knowledgeable about

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,150
their native water properties which is

40
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,680
important instead of just tapping off

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,710
with water some water may require a

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,110
pretreatment either a pH adjustment or

43
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,478
maybe adding RO water if you're giving

44
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:42,478
conditions have to high concentration of

45
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,578
other unwanted kind of calcium magnesium

46
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,399
and other hard water properties

47
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,559
associated so again knowing what your

48
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,930
native water is allowing you to adjust

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,478
with precision in control can allow a

50
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,610
more efficient production especially in

51
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,978
hydroponics making sure that nutrient

52
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:02,280
solution is dialed in is a great way to

53
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:04,670
help improve yields and reduce time to

54
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,670
harvest
