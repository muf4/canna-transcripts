welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,278
we're going to go over proper cannabis

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,480
seedling care

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,638
if you're fortunate enough to get a

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,320
small seedling i want to help you

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,480
understand what environmental conditions

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,839
you'd have set up to increase the best

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
odds of success

9
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,920
of your seedling continuing to grow

10
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:25,839
[Music]

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,599
all right let's get into the video here

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,118
well first off at emergence remember

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,000
emergence is where that ceiling is just

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,518
going to start to

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,359
emerge from whatever substrate media

16
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,879
you're using as soon as the seed emerges

17
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,200
it's important to ensure proper

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
care to allow for continued plant

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,920
development

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
at no point do you want to stunt that

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,840
plant and very early on

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
can have very detrimental effects going

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,719
for the long term

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,719
same basic conditions of germination

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,399
process can be initially maintained

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,840
but changes should be made gradually to

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
ensure strong and quality

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
seedlings produced as those plants start

29
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,279
to age

30
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,039
now what temperature do you want to keep

31
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,198
those seedlings at

32
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,480
well keeping plants slightly cooler than

33
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:03,519
during the germination process is

34
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,118
typically advised

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,880
and what i mean by slightly cooler

36
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,200
you're typically looking at that 68 to

37
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,679
77 degrees fahrenheit or 20 to 25

38
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
degrees

39
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,040
celsius also as is typically the case

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
during the dark or lights off period the

41
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,759
temperature can be decreased to around

42
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,798
65 degrees fahrenheit or 18 degrees

43
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,400
celsius

44
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,640
having this temperature drop can help

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,478
reduce internode spacing or stretching

46
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
and keep the plant stocky and not leggy

47
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,400
weak and thin so a

48
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,519
cool off during the nighttime or lights

49
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,280
off period

50
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,879
can be advantageous you don't always

51
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,000
have to keep them at a really

52
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,599
high temperature now the relative

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
humidity that you want to be having your

54
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,759
plants

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,599
under typically as the plants grows the

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,078
humidity levels will be decreased over

57
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,839
time

58
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,559
eventually reaching that target of that

59
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,079
60 65 percent relative humidity

60
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,519
this reduces the water stress on the

61
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:52,239
plant and allows time for the root

62
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,478
system

63
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,599
to become more robust and that's going

64
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,159
to help you in the long run

65
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,039
produce a healthy stocky ceiling from

66
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,520
the

67
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,799
very tip of fan leaves if that's burning

68
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,718
then it's likely because of lack of

69
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,920
humidity or temperature or light stress

70
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,199
that can be an indication if you're

71
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,878
starting to see at the very end of your

72
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,399
fan leaves a little burning there

73
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,159
that could be an indication that there's

74
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,000
either too low humidity

75
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,878
temperature's too high or there's too

76
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,800
intense light on your little seedling

77
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,000
with speaking specifically about light

78
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,680
the intensity of light should be

79
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
increased as the ceiling develops to

80
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,159
match

81
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,439
the levels it will be exposed to in the

82
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,799
main growing environment

83
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,719
some of your ceilings might be going

84
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,160
outdoors and if they're going outdoors

85
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,039
then light exposure should be

86
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,719
increased to natural sunlight levels

87
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,239
shade netting is commonly used of

88
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,840
different percentages to ease the

89
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,759
transition of the seedlings to the

90
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,598
intensity of natural light levels that

91
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,120
they will be exposed to

92
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,719
however if you're growing indoors the

93
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,080
light exposure should be increased to

94
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,919
the chosen par level

95
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,200
for the veg rooms you're working those

96
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,878
plants harding them

97
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,719
off so you don't get any light burn in

98
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,318
the later stages this can be done

99
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,840
typically by doing the lights if that's

100
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,000
an option with the lights you're using

101
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,920
or by adjusting decreasing the distance

102
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,800
between the lights and the plants

103
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,280
to alter the intensity that those plants

104
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,920
will be

105
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,239
exposed to again over time to help ease

106
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,759
that transition process

107
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,280
now proper watering techniques so when

108
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,878
you've got your little seedlings a fine

109
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,878
nozzle should be used and kept inverted

110
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,959
to allow for natural rain

111
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,878
fall like impact on the seedlings or if

112
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,239
you're using a very fine

113
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,639
nozzle you can point in the right

114
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,039
direction but the key part there is to

115
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,839
reduce the impact of that water on those

116
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,120
seedlings

117
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,200
you always want to keep your nozzle

118
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,360
moving to ensure seedlings get

119
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,958
exposure and the tray can hold some

120
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,319
water reserves to avoid

121
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,640
seedling the desiccation or drying out

122
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,479
now it's hard to kind of explain this so

123
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,759
here i'm going to transition to a video

124
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,000
it's going to show you the proper

125
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,120
watering technique for newly emerged

126
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,719
cannabis seedlings and hope you enjoy it

127
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,560
all right so here we're seeing a bunch

128
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,000
of cannabis seedlings now if you look

129
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,840
closely at the trays

130
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,680
the center of each tray you'll see an

131
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,000
oasis cube missing and that's done

132
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,519
on purpose this is so the person doing

133
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,680
the irrigating can keep an

134
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,799
idea of just how much water is actually

135
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
saturating her in

136
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,840
that tray you also notice the technique

137
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
here where the

138
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,840
spray is being kept very close to the

139
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,920
seedlings and moving around

140
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
making sure to get the corners as well

141
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,119
as the center portions

142
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,720
usually it's the corners that dry out

143
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,720
first it's called the edge effects we

144
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,000
want to be mindful of avoiding that

145
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,759
you can see our way working right

146
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,360
through again it's a pretty fine

147
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,280
nozzle there and just working way back

148
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,120
and forth back and forth we can

149
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,439
also see in the background how many

150
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,160
ceilings this is this can be a way to

151
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,279
ensure

152
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,280
they all get the proper amount of water
