1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,640
so in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,399
going to look at monitoring systems for

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,080
indoor cannabis production

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,919
we talk about monitoring systems there's

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,199
a lot of things to monitor in an indoor

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,120
cannabis production

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,399
area we're going to focus more on the

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,559
growing environment

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,399
and not necessarily the security of the

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,278
site but i'm sure you'll find this

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:20,009
information

12
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,088
useful

13
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,089
[Music]

14
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,960
[Music]

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,879
all right let's look at some of the

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,120
monitoring systems for an indoor canvas

17
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,000
production environmental area

18
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,919
so first off data is important so you do

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,640
not want to estimate conditions having

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
some

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
form of monitoring and or ideally

22
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,319
documenting conditions

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is important there are many options to

24
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,520
consider when it comes to monitoring but

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,799
two main categories involve

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,879
digital data collection and analog

27
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,959
sensors some growers will use the

28
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,960
digital systems as their primary while

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,399
still having an analog as a backup or a

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,399
fail safe

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,920
because there's some benefits to both

32
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,878
systems which we're going to discuss

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,400
here

34
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,079
so first off the digital and that's

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
probably what most growers might be most

36
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,798
familiar with

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,799
and the advantage is why is it so

38
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,760
popular well because it offers precise

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,880
readouts

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
can be preset with minimums and maximums

41
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,079
for levels of alarms

42
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,840
it's also very easy to read it's very

43
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,679
easy for a multitude of workers coming

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,320
through an area to be able to read the

45
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,560
data

46
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,039
collect that data and be very precise

47
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,960
about that inconsistent

48
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,720
however the disadvantages of that

49
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,919
digital monitoring system is it can fail

50
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,359
unexpectedly

51
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,759
more than just the batteries running out

52
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,840
of a ph meter it can provide sometimes

53
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,640
too much information or just get lost in

54
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,280
the data

55
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,879
and often digital monitoring systems are

56
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
more expensive than their analog

57
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,519
counterparts

58
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,359
so some of the advantages though to an

59
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,039
analog system is that it's very

60
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,959
simplified mechanics they can last for a

61
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
very long period of time

62
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,118
they're also reliable and less prone to

63
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,759
failure keep in mind in growing space to

64
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,359
be high humidity high heat

65
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,118
the analogs tend to be a little more

66
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,040
resilient to some of those

67
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,319
overall analog monitoring systems are

68
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
less expensive

69
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,239
compared to the digital monitoring

70
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,159
systems so why aren't analogs always

71
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,280
used the disadvantages

72
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,719
require manual readings and

73
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,000
documentation so has to go through and

74
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,840
write down those numbers

75
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,039
they may not provide exact conditions if

76
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,080
someone may look at that and kind of

77
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,878
like determine oh is that

78
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,280
54 55 you know what am i looking at oh

79
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,919
it's 53 53 and a half two and a quarter

80
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,318
may not be precise as some may want to

81
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,238
be

82
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,919
they also may need calibration to ensure

83
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,400
that they're operating properly

84
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,238
so as a reason these is again some pros

85
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,719
and cons to each as i said analogues can

86
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,120
be used as back up to the digital ones

87
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,000
but make a decision on which one would

88
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,439
you want to have

89
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,439
in your grow space
