00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
here on this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,589
we'll go over an overview of far red's

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,650
impact on cannabis production

4
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,650

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,838
[Music]

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,679
so here we're gonna be looking at far

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,519
red's impact which is the wavelengths

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,879
right down here so let's get into the

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,278
video

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,879
well first off let's define red light

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,960
you might be more familiar with

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,960
red light is at least as effective as

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,599
other colors of light at promoting plant

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,760
growth

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,238
while red light may not be the most

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,200
efficient color for general illumination

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,519
for people

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,520
for high lumens is among the best colors

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,840
of light to stimulate plant growth due

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,079
to the role in photosynthesis

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,039
if you only grow plants under red light

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,960
with no blue light

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,359
they will be elongated or kind of a

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,280
stretched internode spacing

25
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,119
red leds are the most efficient of the

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,840
colors that's why you typically see them

27
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,759
a lot of times

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,920
integrated to those particular light

29
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,878
sources again here's that kind of red

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,440
light spectrum

31
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,558
located right in this area now here

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,558
we're going to talk about far

33
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,000
red light so a little different some

34
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,000
similarities but a little different

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,840
as far red influences the size of the

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,359
leaves the length of stems and

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,760
ultimately the height of the plants as

38
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,599
well far red may take some

39
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,200
may make some plants flower earlier so

40
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,599
there could be other impacts

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,478
when giving plants far red light to

42
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,359
measure it you need

43
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:25,280
a spectro odometer which is a light

44
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,400
measurement tool that is able to measure

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
both the wavelength

46
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,759
and the amplitude of the light emitted

47
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,600
from a light source

48
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
however this comes at increased cost due

49
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,839
to internal complexity of the device

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,799
so you want to make sure you have the

51
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,560
proper device

52
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,159
if you to capture this particular

53
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,719
wavelength if you're looking at doing a

54
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,280
study

55
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,200
we're looking at really analyzing

56
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
exactly how much you're giving plants

57
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
and this far red light is in that 700 to

58
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,118
800 nanometers in length

59
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,399
we can see the change in a tomato plant

60
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,438
and what looks like a squash plant as

61
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,799
well

62
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,239
control plants versus giving them far

63
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,640
red we see that definitely that much

64
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,280
more

65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,640
stretched appearance now lights ability

66
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,640
to penetrate the leaf

67
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,320
so if we're looking at comparisons of

68
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,040
kind of different wavelengths

69
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,599
notice that both the green and also the

70
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,319
far

71
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,239
red light penetrate deep into the leaf

72
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,919
blue and red are absorbed mainly in the

73
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,759
chlorophyll which is located in greater

74
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,000
concentrations on the upper leaf

75
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,679
surface however the deep penetration

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
suggests that structures other than

77
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
chlorophyll are responsible for the

78
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,159
utilization

79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
of these particular wavelengths if most

80
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,120
of the chlorophylls at the surface

81
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
make sense for blue and red to be

82
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,039
absorbed there but if they're

83
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,039
being able to penetrate deeper into the

84
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,519
leaf there may be other

85
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,400
methods or methods for the plant to

86
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,239
absorb

87
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
that particular light energy from those

88
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,400
particular wavelengths

89
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,639
so plant's response to shade so

90
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
reductions in the red to far right ratio

91
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,799
the rfr ratio

92
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,759
660 nanometers to 740 nanometers

93
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
proportion

94
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,959
are the most predominant so on the left

95
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
here

96
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,479
we have the y axis for full sun data in

97
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,598
the right

98
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,799
we have the y axis for both moderate and

99
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,679
deep foliar shade

100
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,599
data we're seeing a comparison here so

101
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,480
again here's our full sun and here's our

102
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:07,840
kind of our

103
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,439
moderate to deep shade kind of

104
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,080
colorations we see the moderate to deep

105
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,840
shade

106
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,120
we're seeing a definitely jump up or an

107
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,200
increase here

108
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
in the uh photon flux there so what does

109
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,238
this kind of tell us well that kind of

110
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,959
goes back to that ability

111
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,239
for it to penetrate deeper into the leaf

112
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,840
surface

113
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,439
so far reds and under leaf comparison

114
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
so we have the overleaf we have the

115
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,878
under leaf

116
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,959
above and below leaf spectrums

117
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,919
comparison here in this

118
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,920
chart provided notice how the under leaf

119
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,958
still receives about 50 percent

120
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,798
of the total far red compared to the

121
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,920
minimum percentage of other colors

122
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,439
so when i say minimum percentage like

123
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,039
well it's pretty equal we'll look

124
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,120
comparison to the greens the

125
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,719
yellows from the oranges and some of the

126
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,560
reds we're seeing it's a

127
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,759
large space there's a large gap there in

128
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,959
the king it's receiving a very small

129
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,798
percentage

130
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,640
here where the far right is only this

131
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,480
tall we almost see an increase

132
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,479
the distance here is almost halfway

133
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,518
about 50 percent of the total far red

134
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,919
it's able to

135
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,599
absorb under the leaf as it is in

136
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,039
comparison to over the leaf so that's

137
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,759
kind of an important part

138
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,519
of this image here now the red and far

139
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,000
red kind of ratios

140
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,399
so the ratio of red and far red changes

141
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,199
in full sun versus shade conditions

142
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,198
full sun has equal red and far red under

143
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,040
plant shade most of the red is used but

144
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
the far red will reach the shaded plant

145
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,919
you see here

146
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,520
so direct sunlight is our canopy shade

147
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,478
when we get to that far red spectrum we

148
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,120
notice that

149
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,758
amount relative photon flux density

150
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,319
percentage

151
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,879
increases dramatically this will induce

152
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,959
shade

153
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,439
avoidance by changing morphology and can

154
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,279
induce early flowering in some plants

155
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,360
shading from another plant reduces both

156
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,638
the light intensity and also changes the

157
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,400
light quality

158
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,560
changes in quality include red to far

159
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,918
red ratio so in direct sunlight the

160
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,519
ratio is about one

161
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,560
uh 1.4 and the shade the ratio is only

162
00:04:54,519 --> 00:05:00,000
0.23 so there's a massive

163
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,038
shift in that now far red

164
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,560
plant shade impacts so here's that same

165
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,120
comparison here we're looking at the far

166
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,879
red

167
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
normal morphology should be a plant that

168
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,719
looks like this if there's a shade

169
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,919
avoidance plant it's grown in kind of a

170
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,479
shady location where

171
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,120
we're kind of looking at the wavelengths

172
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,279
here

173
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,478
or under the tree well we see shade of

174
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,239
voids they're going to have small leaves

175
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,560
that are going to stretch quite a bit

176
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,160
their shade tolerant plant this same

177
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,839
amount of light or kind of

178
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
filtered spectrum of light they're going

179
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,319
to have a much shorter compact

180
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,478
kind of morphology and the leaves will

181
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,000
become a little bit wider as well

182
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,079
again it's under the shade remember

183
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,439
direct sunlight where all these leaves

184
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,879
are getting the direct sunlight

185
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,399
under this tree are going to be what's

186
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,600
called the canopy shade we see that

187
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,239
spectrum definitely

188
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,960
shifts and changes for those plants in

189
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,439
this example

190
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,038
so their morphologies now looking at

191
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,160
petunia ceiling running under different

192
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,519
light for another little source of

193
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,560
comparison

194
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,120
b is blue r is red f r is far red micro

195
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,959
moles

196
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,720
per meter squared per second is the

197
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,879
subscript number

198
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,560
and high versus low light intensities of

199
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,079
red and far red while keeping blue light

200
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,600
intensity is constant

201
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,758
so we see kind of some great kind of

202
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,000
images here in comparisons

203
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,680
the blue light their subscript is

204
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
consistent through all of these trials

205
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
we see but the plants look very

206
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,439
different

207
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,199
what we're changing or in this study

208
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,240
changed the amount of red and far

209
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,360
red that the plants were receiving so

210
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,960
that intensity is the subscript number

211
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,439
so we can see that in this case it was

212
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,198
given twice as much red versus far red

213
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,800
here it was given equal red and far red

214
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,919
and we can definitely see the changes in

215
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,840
morphology

216
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,198
they measured specifically plant height

217
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,359
and it gives you that nice little

218
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,360
comparison to see what impact

219
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,759
the different wavelengths can have on

220
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,960
the morphology of the plants

221
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
now interaction of red and far red and

222
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,918
ppfd

223
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,560
so remember that's photosynthetically

224
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,359
photon

225
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,519
flux density transplanted seedlings from

226
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,038
previous slide to a greenhouse now so

227
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,639
that was kind of the seedling stage

228
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,719
now let's go a little bit longer in

229
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,759
their life all grown under the same

230
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
conditions

231
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,598
including light after transplant so

232
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,159
what's kind of an interesting note

233
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,598
is that while these plants started here

234
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
and they got different light treatments

235
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:10,319
they were then

236
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,759
all moved to a greenhouse setting and

237
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,199
they all got normal light

238
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,800
so how does the seedling environment

239
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,400
impact the flower cycle and we can see

240
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,199
that there is some differences

241
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,239
plants flower faster under highlight

242
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,478
intensity light

243
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
and also when grown under far red light

244
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,279
so we see that shift there when they had

245
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,038
equal blue and red

246
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,719
they weren't even flowering we could see

247
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:29,680
a shift in the days to flower from

248
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
transplant

249
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,000
with the blue and the intense red and

250
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,639
far red being the quickest here

251
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,399
for days to flower after transplant so

252
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
just an interesting note that in the

253
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,758
seedling stage the

254
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,758
wavelengths that plants are given can

255
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,439
have impacts when they get older

256
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,120
even if there's a transition point where

257
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,000
then they're all given consistent amount

258
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,280
of lighting

259
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,959
at least here in petunias now the impact

260
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,559
on yield with adding a far

261
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,159
red since that's probably an interesting

262
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
thing to kind of take a look at

263
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,000
far red is in the 700 to 800 nanometer

264
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,639
wavelength range

265
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,519
so it is outside of the ppfd range of

266
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,360
measurement

267
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,758
which only takes into account 400 to

268
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,280
700. lettuce is a leafy green that shows

269
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,960
great response to far red light

270
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,519
you're typically growing it for that

271
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:17,359
kind of leaf material

272
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,918
reduced ppfd in far red trials attempts

273
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
to provide all plants with consistent p

274
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,918
a pfd

275
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
of 350 micromoles per meter squared per

276
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,159
second

277
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,919
here we're looking at dry masses again

278
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
looking at lettuce yield with far right

279
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,439
added

280
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,000
dry mass data here was normalized to

281
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,440
have the

282
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,719
350 ppfd trials be an even 100 grams so

283
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,560
they're normalized here

284
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,879
those were set at 100 so we can have a

285
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,359
much easier visual comparison

286
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,000
both trials had far red added improved

287
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,759
yields

288
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,080
with the white or full spectrum light

289
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,838
having the largest yield overall

290
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,360
so this is in comparison to the red blue

291
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,480
only wavelengths compared to the kind of

292
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,519
white wavelengths

293
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,320
so as we see here not only are we having

294
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,720
an increase in

295
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,720
overall yield but in addition we're

296
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,278
being able to diagnose potential plant

297
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,278
problems

298
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,200
with this full spectrum led light as

299
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,240
well so better yield and better to

300
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,879
diagnose disease

301
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,519
overall probably a more favorable light

302
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,600
if we add

303
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,560
far red again getting that increase in

304
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,080
dry mass as well

305
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,000
just a side note in the study that they

306
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,759
were running at 300 because they were

307
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,080
assuming another 50 was coming from the

308
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,240
far red to keep that 350

309
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,480
amount of intensity of light the same

310
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,399
only changing the spectrum that those

311
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,159
plants were given

312
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,399
so added faraway light can increase cell

313
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,838
expansion so control in far red we see

314
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,000
the tomatoes soybean cucumber and

315
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,160
spinach the difference in morphologies

316
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,679
pretty stark and different even here

317
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,639
just looking at them we can definitely

318
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,199
see that there is

319
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,399
overall an increase in plant height when

320
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,600
we add that far

321
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,278
red there now common light sources in

322
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,879
percent far red produced

323
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,039
here's just some you might be familiar

324
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,679
with cmh lights or high pressure sodium

325
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,559
lights

326
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,319
just as note sunlight does produce 20

327
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,759
percent far red light

328
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,079
however when we saw the comparison

329
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,159
before why don't all the plants super

330
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,519
stretch as very high amount when we're

331
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,519
looking at sunlight

332
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,440
well keep in mind sunshine also has high

333
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,759
levels of blue light about 27

334
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,200
in uv a which reduce cell expansion and

335
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,600
stretching so there's kind of that like

336
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,959
balancing effect there some of these

337
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,639
other lights are just producing more of

338
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,599
that far right with reduction in that

339
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,600
blue wavelength

340
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,278
that's why you tend to get some more of

341
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,440
that stretching

342
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,600
now what's far red's impact on cannabis

343
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,399
production welfare can cause cannabis

344
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
plant stretching

345
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,399
so is advised to be of greater

346
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,720
importance later in the growing cycle

347
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,159
far red exposure may also induce earlier

348
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,480
flowering times in canvas so that should

349
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,278
be

350
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,480
make note of that when growing outdoors

351
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,039
the high 20

352
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,159
far red is counter acted by the very

353
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,240
high 27

354
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,919
blue light spectrum so don't say oh the

355
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,360
sunlight's got 20 percent farad let me

356
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,599
give my plants 20 percent

357
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
remember sunlight is giving a bunch of

358
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
other spectrums as well

359
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,639
when measuring light a pfd meter will

360
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,959
take into account

361
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,000
uv and far right light but this should

362
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,078
only be done with

363
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,278
led lights and not high pressure sodium

364
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,199
lights due to the strong

365
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,159
infrared spectrum they also produce

366
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
which will might give you an

367
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,240
artificially high reading

368
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,679
of pfd if you're taking into account

369
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,839
those additional

370
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,759
wavelengths if you want to learn more

371
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,720
where this kind of information came from

372
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,759
special thanks to all of the researchers

373
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,519
shown here

374
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,799
sharing their information hopefully

375
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,399
you're able to glean some information

376
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,919
from what i've kind of summarized and

377
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,679
presented here

378
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:32,159
as a way to kind of better understand

379
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,159
light's impact on cannabis plants
