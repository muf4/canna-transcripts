1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,169
okay here I want to probably a brief

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:06,689
overview of some season extenders in the

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:08,730
different styles some growers use these

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,469
terms interchangeably but I want you to

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,440
understand what each of these different

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:15,329
titles refers to so we're just season

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,910
extenders all of these are performing

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,100
the same tasks so first off there's our

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,809
small style the season extenders and

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,760
they're just covering the rows and they

11
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,858
can help protect small plantings or

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,679
early plantings or plants that are going

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,260
to stay small initially great options

14
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,179
there to extend the season there to get

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,910
out a little bit earlier or to hold them

16
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,679
a little bit later in the season then

17
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,628
there's our mid-size season extender so

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,219
these are called caterpillar tunnels the

19
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:42,599
gray if you're considering a high tunnel

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,230
but are unsure if you want to commit to

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,469
a hotel they're easy to set up and set

22
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:51,509
one up easily over a weekend maybe a

23
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,410
date at least for the first one takes a

24
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,988
little bit time to get everything

25
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:57,628
oriented but offer a lot of the

26
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:02,640
advantage that high tunnel offers but a

27
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:04,438
little bit quicker easier and cheaper up

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,790
coming from our midsize we have our

29
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,798
large size and these would be our full

30
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,990
high tunnels this is it's kind of this

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,600
size here do the grants are becoming

32
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,250
very popular if you do get more than one

33
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,169
I do recommend you get two of the same

34
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,930
size because it makes management of them

35
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,280
a lot easier they have advantage but

36
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,680
they need to be taken care of especially

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,640
in the winter removing plastic is a

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,729
great option

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,069
I'd revenge them from caving in also

40
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,719
they can lead to build-up of nutrients

41
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,908
and pests again if you're not removing

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,618
the plastic so it's good to kind of

43
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,478
remove that plastic let some snow what

44
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,159
some winter rains come through to kind

45
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,959
of flush out some of the nutrients that

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,009
may be being accumulated in them over

47
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,989
the growing season

48
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,478
now hotels are different than

49
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:47,658
greenhouses high tunnels are temporary

50
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,890
and do not have extra heat sources

51
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,530
greenhouses are more of a permanent

52
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,780
structure typically a floor here and you

53
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,820
can see that evident here this would be

54
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,280
example of a hotel can technically be

55
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,898
moved pretty easily in not permanent

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,019
structures and on a tower of running to

57
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,868
them now season extensions no matter

58
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:09,689
what size or unit you're using be sure

59
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:12,659
to keep them clean inside and out is

60
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:14,159
very important this is often overlooked

61
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,530
we do seek to potential

62
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,299
for disease carryover limit the local

63
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,039
pest pressure this is also why I

64
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,230
recommend using insect netting to

65
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,500
eliminate insects but keeping them clean

66
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:27,419
both interior and exterior that's an

67
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,300
example of a farm I visited this is one

68
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,679
of the high tunnels that they have and

69
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,930
you can see it's very clean

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,210
this is even during the peak of tomato

71
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,060
season see in between the rows are all

72
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,939
nice and cleanly kept irrigation under

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,580
here nicely pruned nicely trained

74
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,789
keeping that I tunnel clean is very

75
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,350
important to reducing disease pressure

76
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:50,849
now season extension can be early such

77
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:52,799
as March April and May and they've

78
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:54,629
antecedent jump on this season can often

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,730
get ahead of pest pressure this is where

80
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,199
I think they're most advantageous late

81
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:00,329
in the season extended crops into

82
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,859
September October November it can

83
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,360
continue this season for a longer to get

84
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,710
closer to their Thanksgiving meal if

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,410
you're trying to supply that for maybe a

86
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,330
CSA but the pest pressure can be higher

87
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:10,349
so that's a little bit of precaution if

88
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,600
you want to go later in the season

89
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,590
typically its investigate that early

90
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,079
season jump because you're getting

91
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,920
beating out the pests must always keep

92
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,920
your structure clean
