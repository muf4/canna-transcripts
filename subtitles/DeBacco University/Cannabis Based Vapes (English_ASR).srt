00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,480
going to be looking at cannabis based

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,480
vapes

4
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:14,480
[Music]

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,879
all right let's look at canvas-based

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,839
vapes as an end product of the cannabis

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,640
plant

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,640
so first off looking at ct pharma is one

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,320
company that does produce these

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,320
that i'm just going to focus on some of

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,199
their products as they have publicly

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
available

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,039
analytical reports and labels of the

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,200
products that they produce

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,800
in this video the descriptions options

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,320
and uses are intended to provide an

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,000
understanding of some of the end

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,600
products of the cannabis plant

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,119
remember those analytical reports are

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,719
important and often

21
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,320
missed component that should accompany

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
any product someone is interested in

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,399
purchasing

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,079
and you'll see an example of one of

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,520
those at the end

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,280
so far stuff what's it just a general

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
description of the vapes well

28
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,399
vape character is pre-filled with high

29
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,399
quality high potency

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,600
marijuana oil could be high in thc or

31
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,000
high in cbd

32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,679
these cartridges are color coded based

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,079
on the strain type and come in

34
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,959
half gram sizes you can see here that

35
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,719
they

36
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,118
can mass produce them as well and we see

37
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,438
the labels being put on in that image

38
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,519
now what are some options of vapes well

39
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,519
cd farmer offers two different styles

40
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,438
the pure vape cartridges which are

41
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,879
standard cartridge that can be used with

42
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,199
a 510 thread type and battery or we see

43
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,879
here

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
the peak slim disposable vape and

45
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,280
they're pre-filled vape and a battery

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,840
combination

47
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,239
that once completed can be discarded so

48
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,000
they're offering those options as well

49
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,759
now what are the general uses for vapes

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,359
well vapes are alternative to standard

51
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,400
flour when it's used with a ceramic

52
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,239
heating element

53
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,079
within the cartridge evenly heats the

54
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,759
oil to the point of vaporization so it

55
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,359
can be easily consumed

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
vaporization is an easy way of

57
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,280
consumption as you still receive

58
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
a good taste in medical effects without

59
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,079
leaving such a large odor

60
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,319
as you would with regular dried flour

61
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,000
now these examples of certificates of

62
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,199
analysis i was mentioning

63
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,519
many people are going to look at the

64
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,920
terpenes and cannabinoids great to look

65
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,519
at

66
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,040
but also remember you also need to be

67
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,679
concerned with the microbial analysis

68
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,600
heavy metals mycotoxins and pesticides

69
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,000
to make sure your product is that you're

70
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,439
purchasing is passing all of those

71
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,959
now all these look kind of bland and

72
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,680
boring it's important to match up lot

73
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,680
numbers

74
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
and the numbers presented here should

75
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,879
also appear on

76
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,479
the label as well but it's you're right

77
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,479
as a consumer to make sure you have

78
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,039
access to the actual original reports

79
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,238
to back up the information in numbers

80
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,560
stated here

81
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,239
on the label just part of being a

82
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
well-informed consumer

83
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,239
and it's something many people overlook

84
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,839
but it is your right as a consumer to

85
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,840
ask for those analytical reports
