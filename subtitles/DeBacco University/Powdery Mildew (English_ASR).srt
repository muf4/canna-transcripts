1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,229
okay here I'm gonna explain a little bit

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,869
about powdery mildew which we can see

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,809
evident right here on the leaves which

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,120
is commonly seen sadly in many grow

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:15,869
operations ah because you can spread

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:19,169
quite easily and cause issues in many

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:20,429
grow spaces so first off powdery mildew

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,650
it's probably one of the top concerns

9
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,750
for growers and it literally looks like

10
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,629
white powder which is actually mycelium

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,759
that can produce spores mycelium once

12
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,559
seen with the naked eye it's an

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,079
indication there's much more environment

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,729
control measures should be taken this

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,619
means is once you see it at this level

16
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,779
if you consider it at the microscopic

17
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,189
level you're not just seeing one small

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,710
nice thing I'm you're seeing many many

19
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,259
mycelium on the surface giving us a name

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,600
implies that powdered look to the leaves

21
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,558
and that's an indication you're probably

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,270
a little late to the game

23
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,808
but you should definitely be employing a

24
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,480
control measure at the first sign now

25
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,608
we're to look well this is mainly found

26
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,189
on the leaves so this is the area you

27
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,870
should be focusing your scouting we want

28
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:06,658
to look at the most shaded leaves that

29
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,969
are either under one leaf or deeper into

30
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,890
the canopy now it can occur in areas

31
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,709
near the buds but usually it first shows

32
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,170
up that those shaded in sheltered areas

33
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:19,079
that are away from the light and also

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,000
tend to have higher humidity levels it

35
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,560
typically will start also not only on

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,719
these leaves but on the underside of

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,850
these leaves so you can see here on the

38
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,709
upper end but typically when we're

39
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:30,899
scouting or searching to threaten those

40
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,429
I see them at the very early stages you

41
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,618
want to turn these leaves over and look

42
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,880
at the undersides because that's tend to

43
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:37,769
be a little bit more protected and a

44
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,569
little bit more moisture pendent now how

45
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:40,950
to prevent parry mildew well it thrives

46
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,779
in conditions that are humid to the

47
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,909
point do forming on the leaves an

48
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,250
additional large temperature swings can

49
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,659
encourage the development as a result

50
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,849
you can have a little bit more pressure

51
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,259
in the spring in the fall because of

52
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,500
those temperature fluctuations that

53
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,629
naturally occur the goal prevention is

54
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,938
to maintain a dry leaf surface and avoid

55
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:02,069
large changes in temperature in your

56
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:03,359
grow operation and if you're an indoor

57
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:05,459
you have a little bit more control over

58
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,468
this for outdoor or tunnel production

59
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,299
keep in mind of those fall in spring

60
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:11,370
times when you're having those wide

61
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,780
changes in tempo terrific and moderate

62
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,550
that they're going to be a way to reduce

63
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,969
and hopefully prevent powdery mildew

64
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,920
formation how to control it will oxidate

65
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:22,659
as we see here the stabilized

66
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:25,509
concentrate hydrogen peroxide is good

67
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:28,120
for a quick spray option to accomplish

68
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:29,679
the same end goal with much less work so

69
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,300
the advantage here is you're able to

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,069
kind of quickly clean the leaves and

71
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,250
hopefully then go through and implement

72
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:38,409
preventive measures this is a good

73
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,810
product because I mean peroxide doesn't

74
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:44,349
last very long so the rants of having a

75
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,810
long-term residue is basically vastly

76
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:49,329
reduced if you're looking for a bit more

77
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,159
stable control milk can actually be used

78
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,640
and that's may sound a little weird or

79
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,409
strange but 40% milk and 60% water whole

80
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,599
milk is preferred due to the fat

81
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:01,060
spreading it more evenly across the leaf

82
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,519
surface and with the pH change that

83
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,180
occurs with milk with the coating of the

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,060
leaf surface this is a great organic way

85
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,040
to try to control powdery mildew

86
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,110
especially once it's seen on the early

87
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,389
stages and while this may not kill the

88
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,790
actual mycelium it definitely slows down

89
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,768
the progression and ideally will prevent

90
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:22,060
the initial formation of powdery mildew

91
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,409
if you know that you're in a

92
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,409
high-pressure situation
