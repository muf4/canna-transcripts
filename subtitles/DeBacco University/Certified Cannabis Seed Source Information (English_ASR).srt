1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,240
all right in this debaco university

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,919
video we'll be looking at certified

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,720
cannabis seed source

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,480
information and using one example here

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,679
to provide you with some information

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,400
some specifics

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,320
so you can become informed consumer and

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,589
know what you're purchasing and ensure

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:26,800
you're getting quality cannabis seeds

10
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:28,000
[Music]

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,320
all right let's get started with this

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,640
tobacco university video

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,480
so first off check your state for an

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
approved list so i chose

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,799
connecticut here to use as an example

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,280
their information is easily found on the

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,959
web

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
so make sure you're checking your own

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,280
area to make sure you're complying with

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
those

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,480
guidelines even if you're from the state

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,359
of connecticut make sure that you're

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,599
also

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,719
keeping up to date with the latest

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,719
requirements

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,879
so just using this as an example here

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,039
certified seed or clones or propagules

28
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,358
obtained from a certified seed must be

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,439
used it must be approved list here

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,800
certified seed means hemp seed for which

31
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,280
a certificate or

32
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,280
other instrument has been issued by an

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,478
agency authorized under the laws of the

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,079
state territory

35
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,400
or possession of the united states to

36
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,319
officially certify hemp seed and that

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,439
has standards and procedures approved by

38
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,478
the united states secretary of

39
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,959
agriculture

40
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,039
to assure the genetic purity identify of

41
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,199
hemp seeds certified

42
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,720
so i know that sounds like a lot of long

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,079
legality information

44
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,478
but this is important that you're

45
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,959
following the rules and requirements

46
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,560
set by your state the department will

47
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,158
accept varieties that have been approved

48
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,118
by the state department of agriculture

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,960
for use

50
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,959
in their hemp growing programs it's

51
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,280
another important note to make

52
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,000
make you aware of varieties listed as

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,560
prohibited

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,118
or a variety of concern and may not be

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
used

56
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,799
particularly those have been identified

57
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,879
by some previous testing or information

58
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,640
so you as a grower want to know this

59
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,399
seed source and that's true in any

60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,920
regards but especially with cannabis

61
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,200
seed production

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,359
on the grower application you must

63
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,600
provide information considering the

64
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,200
source of your seed or propagules used

65
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,959
you must provide evidence that the seed

66
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,959
propagules are certified by

67
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,759
the state designation seed certification

68
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,280
agencies are approved for cultivation by

69
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,199
another state territory

70
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,878
or possession copy of sea label if you

71
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,119
intend to cultivate

72
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,799
so again keep this in mind that the

73
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,800
having this documentation

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
have this information knowing that that

75
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,959
variety has been approved

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
is all important and is the grower's

77
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
responsibility

78
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
now this state department of agriculture

79
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,159
official publication so there is some

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,400
wonderful information here in the sense

81
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,079
that below are examples of documentation

82
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,879
you can use to support your hemp seed

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,400
selection

84
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,639
and upload as part of your hemp grower

85
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,719
license application at least in this

86
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,479
example for the state of connecticut

87
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,239
a company supplying your seed should be

88
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,318
able to provide you with evidence that

89
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,319
the specific variety or cultivar has

90
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,719
been approved for use in a state

91
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,079
with a hemp production program so that's

92
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,840
very important

93
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,319
they can't provide with this sort of

94
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,759
documentation or paperwork probably not

95
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,799
a good idea to be purchasing from them

96
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,239
in the first place

97
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,840
additionally you must maintain records

98
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,640
that include invoices of any

99
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
certification

100
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,839
information that accompanied the seeds

101
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,400
so again it's

102
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,039
very important as hemp cannabis growers

103
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,599
to be very organized as well

104
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,079
so this is just an example of a seed

105
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,639
label

106
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,440
and again there's not necessarily all

107
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,518
100

108
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,199
standardized but example labels to

109
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,319
provide an idea of what to look for when

110
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,878
purchasing seed

111
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,759
some seeds may have flashy packaging but

112
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,639
these are

113
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,318
what is required for documentation here

114
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,199
you're looking at you know percent pure

115
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,679
seed

116
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,280
um the dormant or hard seed potential

117
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,879
weed seeds if any noxious seeds were

118
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,640
found the germination percentage which

119
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,639
remember is different than emergence

120
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,679
the origin the test date the net weight

121
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,919
and there's some

122
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
individual information here blocked also

123
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,839
knowing the lot number can be important

124
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,438
in case there's a problem with the seeds

125
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,878
you can refer back to the purchase

126
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,120
person you purchased it from

127
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,399
and quote the lot number you may also

128
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,080
get some different kind of

129
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,319
information as well as potential strain

130
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,920
that was that was crossed together

131
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:12,719
they said germination purity potential

132
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,199
cbds thc percentages again keeping that

133
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,319
equal to

134
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,079
zero or under 0.3 percent so that you're

135
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,680
federally classified as hemp and not

136
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,600
marijuana as well as some other

137
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,879
information here potentially spacing and

138
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
height and root system

139
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,199
can all be advantageous to the grower

140
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,800
but just important to ensure you have

141
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
some of this documentation

142
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
so you can provide it as part of your

143
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
application and

144
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,918
upon request so you don't get into

145
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,918
trouble in the long run
