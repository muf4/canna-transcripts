1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,839
here we'll look at some of the basics of

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,129
hydroponics we see a great image here

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,589
showing some plants being grown

4
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:09,719
hydroponically but this is not the only

5
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,849
way our plants can be grown for it still

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:15,058
to be counted as or classified as

7
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,230
hydroponics so first off hydroponics is

8
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,629
the science of growing plants without

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,579
soil a lot of people think hydroponics

10
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,890
means purely grown in water that's not

11
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,570
necessarily the case because this can

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,760
include Rockwell's coconut fiber clay

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,129
pebbles and others that do not contain a

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,960
high neural base content all of these

15
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,589
would still be classified technically as

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,450
hydroponics addition of these or more

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,790
traditional aerated water conditions are

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,109
also classified as hydroponic so think

19
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,539
of like if you're growing plants in

20
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,280
water or some aerated water that is

21
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,320
hydroponics and that's typically what's

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,910
associated when someone says hydro

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,980
products but keep in mind Raquel coconut

24
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,679
fiber and clay pebbles can also be

25
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,328
classified as hydroponics simply because

26
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,509
they gave very little minerals to the

27
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,128
planet now hydroponic production allows

28
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:01,140
growers have near complete control over

29
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,089
a nutrient uptake we can see this row of

30
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,558
tomatoes grown in the greenhouse they

31
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,868
are grown in Rockwell's but again this

32
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,149
is classified as hydroponics the part of

33
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:11,420
the reason why is this allows for higher

34
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,460
yields than soil production however

35
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,810
growers also can

36
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:17,938
incorrectly feed the plant which can

37
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,769
reduce overall yields so because you can

38
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,139
control everything that plant is getting

39
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:25,048
with the exact nutrient solutions exact

40
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,118
concentrations that's great we have

41
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,020
great control but with that comes great

42
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,450
responsibility

43
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,188
so with great control comes great

44
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,710
responsibility and this is where you can

45
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,539
maximize yields but the grower can also

46
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,699
sadly mess things up if they're not

47
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,770
careful the advantages they said

48
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,710
efficient production per plant could see

49
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,179
very little area being used here ideally

50
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,309
getting high yields the grower has

51
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,649
control over the nutrients as a result

52
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,019
can healed better than soil production

53
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,450
it's also very clean and sterile

54
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,670
to try to eliminate or reduce the chance

55
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,409
of getting disease however the

56
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,269
disadvantages are it can be expensive to

57
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,820
initially set up can have a more complex

58
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,218
setup or an arrangement does repair time

59
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,319
and technical knowledge some cost to

60
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:09,000
ideally have good quality need to have

61
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,799
continual monitoring of the operation

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,199
and it's not as forgiving as soil

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,520
production so again a little bit more

64
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,649
dialed

65
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,300
it can add nutrients very quickly but

66
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,810
can also go to nutrient deficient as

67
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,280
well limitations for hydroponic is

68
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,379
burning the roots and nutrient uptake

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,759
you got to watch that pH I want to make

70
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,039
sure you're not over feeding the plants

71
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,509
either when I ensure nutrient solutions

72
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,069
are well mixed before adding them to

73
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,829
plants and want to keep the root zone

74
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,989
area oxygenated keep in mind the roots

75
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,440
no matter how small or large do need an

76
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,230
oxygen source because they are respiring

77
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,210
and taking in that oxygen breaking down

78
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,889
those sugars so that they can grow so

79
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,480
keeping that pH of that water correct

80
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,609
and keeping that aeration are very

81
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,030
important things with any Crudup onok

82
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,030
production
