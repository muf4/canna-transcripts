1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,068
here we're gonna look at your sentences

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,798
of taste and smell in a little more

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:12,179
detail so grab the popcorn in the end

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,190
and joy sensing chemicals for taste so

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,350
the taste receptors if you have are

6
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:18,420
important for sensing chemicals your

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,420
taste buds are located in raised areas

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,760
called papillae food chemicals dissolve

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,420
in saliva and contact the taste cells

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,269
the dissolving of those chemicals in the

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,920
watery secretions of your salivary

12
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,500
glands are important to help it enhance

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,939
some of the taste we're really hard to

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,340
taste something that's completely dry

15
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,709
this is another reason why your bias

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,379
secretes so much saliva to help your

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,969
taste buds work properly there's

18
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:46,949
different taste buds locating different

19
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,450
regions of your tongue but in general

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,370
the taste buds are those found those

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,620
raised portions and they're detecting

22
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:56,038
the sweetness or sourness of particular

23
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,558
food items that you're consuming smell

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,789
is also called olfactory receptors these

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,829
are cells that are embedded in the

26
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,929
epithelium of the nasal passage your

27
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,640
turn a tail passage and if we look in a

28
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,430
little more detail we see these sensors

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,540
here reaching out the olfactory bulbs

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,460
the key part we have our bone area we

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,729
have are basically olfactory receptor

32
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,679
cells here located number six the

33
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:22,679
produce this intense network this is a

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,560
causing this nice network of cells here

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,159
they're able then to pick up or sense

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,810
for the taste of the sense of smell now

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,150
the smell is all factory receptors are

38
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,969
far more sensitive in dogs we compared

39
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,460
to our own in humans ingredients for the

40
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:41,759
basic chemical families of explosives

41
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:45,599
such as various powders camels dynamite

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,540
TNT c4 are placed in random containers

43
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,030
and dogs are able to learn these types

44
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,009
of what they smell like then they can be

45
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,340
used at airports as a way to detect if

46
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:59,218
something's located in a bag or in a

47
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,560
region that shouldn't be these odors are

48
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:04,618
imprinted on the dog's brains via

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,759
consistent repetition and reward this is

50
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:11,489
called Pavlov style of training the dogs

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,830
what Pavlov did was here we see dogs his

52
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,930
food MIT salivates the dog

53
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,420
sibel this year zobelle doesn't

54
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,879
recognize anything but then what the

55
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:23,009
pavlof did as part of the experiment was

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,650
ring a bell and present food causing the

57
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,030
dog to salivate ultimately they trained

58
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,860
the dog that when the bell rang they

59
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,680
would automatically increase its

60
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,040
salaries and secretions so same thing

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,650
here when a dog in training is detected

62
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,929
to find TNT or c4 dynamite Sri lured

63
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,230
with food therefore what's gone through

64
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,599
in this case the airport here it knows

65
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,449
what it's searching for it's well if it

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,719
does find that it'll be rewarded with

67
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:53,159
food with food or a treat the reason why

68
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,810
is put in random containers it so the

69
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:56,099
dogs is not randomly searching and never

70
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,709
finds anything it's getting that

71
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,199
continual reinforcement there's a way to

72
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,580
kind of show with the olfactory

73
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:05,159
receptors do look like it's this intense

74
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,140
Network here's a factory bulb and this

75
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,750
is kind of what's when we take in air

76
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:13,169
particles this intense network here is

77
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,120
sensing our sense of smell transferring

78
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,609
that to the brain allowing us to

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,860
recognize certain sense hopefully this

80
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,760
is helpful me adding a little bit more

81
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,760
to your understanding of taste and smell

82
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:25,759
senses
