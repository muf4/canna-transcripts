00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,359
i'm going to go over whole plant harvest

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,359
process of cannabis

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,400
tune in at the end where we'll see a

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,559
great example

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,559
of an entire plant and if you're looking

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,919
at implementing this particular method

8
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,919
it might be a little bit more

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
challenging

10
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,079
[Music]

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,400
all right let's get into whole plant

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,639
harvest process regarding cannabis

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,479
so first off the whole plant harvest is

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,439
a very simple process many growers

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,600
prefer

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,119
to whole plant harvest simply because

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,000
it's easy and does not require

18
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,439
a lot of detailed or very attentive eye

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,159
taking the whole plant cut it

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,839
move it next step especially for larger

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,878
operations that may have a variety of

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,559
people harvesting

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,399
it's a very easy and standardized

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,159
approach and it's simple for everyone to

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
follow the same process

26
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,279
the head grower can kind of come in say

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,079
we're taking all these plants and it's

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,239
just kind of

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,920
repeat cut the entire plant down

30
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,519
transport repeat that process cut the

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,520
entire plant down transport and

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,359
there's no looking at determining oh is

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,240
this bud ripe or is that blood ripe

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,960
just that plant's gone go right ahead

35
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,199
and also allows one pass through

36
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,000
the field or the area of growing with

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,600
whole plant harvesting

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
growers also do not have to return to

39
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,719
the planting site which is

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,479
great advantageous at least for the main

41
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,000
crop if they're growing outdoors like

42
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,200
this might be playing a cover crop but

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,799
at least they won't be dealing with the

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
main crop

45
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,000
one harvesting the entire plant also

46
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,599
allows for better

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
timing of the flushing process along

48
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,759
with removal of irrigation equipment

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,359
in addition if a block of plants is

50
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,879
removed and this area can be cleaned

51
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,078
right after harvest to prepare for the

52
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,478
following steps

53
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,078
uh as an entire area don't have to like

54
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,519
go through just one little section

55
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,319
large areas can be done which can be

56
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,599
very efficient for outdoor locations

57
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,279
this could be getting a cover crop

58
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,719
planted if you're an indoor location

59
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
this would be cleaning and sterilizing

60
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,359
the area

61
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,279
to get ready for another round or grow

62
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,359
cycle of plants

63
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,439
now that whole plant harvest usually can

64
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,200
or can mean whole plant drying

65
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,879
so with the removal of the entire plant

66
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,000
this allows the entire plant to dry at

67
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,839
the same time

68
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,359
since there is a lot of plant material

69
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,159
this can often mean a slower drying

70
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,639
process

71
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,599
which actually some prefer so here there

72
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,598
is some trimming

73
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,359
that was initially done but we can see

74
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,840
here pretty much the entire plants are

75
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,480
being

76
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,159
strung up here to dry in this particular

77
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,079
dry room

78
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,759
now if you're making concentrates as an

79
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
example of the end product of the

80
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,280
harvest is going to be concentrates

81
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,719
then whole plant harvest is advised

82
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
since the optimum brightness does not

83
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,159
need to be

84
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,519
as exact for each individual bud as if

85
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,280
you're going for example for dry flower

86
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,560
now indoor whole plant harvesting so if

87
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,759
you're an indoor grower looking at whole

88
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
plant harvesting

89
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,719
they have it a little easier since they

90
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,360
can control the environment or on the

91
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,840
plant

92
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400
and can time the exact harvest stay in

93
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,920
time with

94
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,000
weeks within the week and in advance

95
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,679
in some cases so that means you can plan

96
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
okay put it on the calendar in two weeks

97
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,439
we're taking down

98
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,040
flower room four for example it doesn't

99
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,919
matter if it's raining outside if it's

100
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,919
hot sun outside if it's snowing outside

101
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,679
if you're in a northern location you can

102
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,000
plan that ahead of time so that really

103
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
is

104
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,479
advantageous for the indoor controlled

105
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,159
environment growers they can put that

106
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,399
date in the calendar and go through and

107
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,560
take all those plants down

108
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,319
for outdoor growers they have a little

109
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
bit more of a challenge

110
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,158
especially for large scale growers

111
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
taking the plant at one saves time

112
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,560
labor and money but we can see that is a

113
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,318
lot of labor be aware of the weather

114
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
wet and cold temperatures and the

115
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:28,719
increased odds of disease for example

116
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,799
bud rot

117
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,479
developing in the flowers removing the

118
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,840
plants as a whole reduces potential for

119
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,759
disease spread

120
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,519
and other plants in the growing area so

121
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,120
that's why it's advantageous for outdoor

122
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,680
growers if you can handle the entire

123
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,000
plants

124
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,879
to go through and to remove the entire

125
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,360
plants

126
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,199
we see this grow operation right here

127
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,080
pretty standardized size of plants which

128
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,518
is great

129
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
we're now going to get into going

130
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,799
outdoors looking at one plant

131
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,719
that you may want to have second

132
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
thoughts if you're considering doing an

133
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,560
entire plant harvest

134
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,239
though it would be possible i'm often

135
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,400
asked how big can a cannabis plant

136
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,400
grow outside in southern new england

137
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,039
well this is a fine specimen

138
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
right here showing the effect that good

139
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,840
soil can have

140
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,318
on total plant production this is just

141
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,238
one plant to give you that general size

142
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:18,319
orientation is producing

143
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,560
quite a number of buds again maybe not

144
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,000
the largest most prolific buds but for

145
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
something that was just kind of grown

146
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,759
outside in this kind of compost pile

147
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,959
it does provide you with some idea of

148
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,360
just how big these plants

149
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,879
can get even in southern new england

150
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,840
that may have a more limiting season

151
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:42,478
than other

152
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:42,478
regions in the country
