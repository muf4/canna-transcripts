1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
so this video lecture is going to go

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,120
over some basic classifications or types

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,960
of tires

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,039
there's a lot of information contained

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,638
on all of the slides so be sure to pause

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,758
if you want to learn more specifically

7
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:13,279
about each tire

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,599
i'm going to just going to give you a

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,320
brief overview here in the video lecture

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,359
for the different types of tires so

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,640
first off the kind of

12
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
probably the most obvious we have your

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,518
passenger or all season

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,760
tires these have those longer tread wear

15
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,000
good ride reasonable traction

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
kind of your kind of common one that

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
you're most likely to see because they

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,679
can be used

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,759
year-round or all season

20
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,759
moving on from a passenger all season

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,439
tire we can have winter tires

22
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,159
particularly in areas that tend to get a

23
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,519
lot of snow

24
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,919
or winter weather this is designed for

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,680
maximum traction and snow kind of slushy

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,719
ice you can see the different tread

27
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,079
pattern

28
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,280
over here located here on what's defined

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,198
as a winter tire

30
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,480
now they're typically not used all

31
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,079
season because they tend to be a little

32
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,238
bit more aggressive

33
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,119
and better able to handle the winter

34
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,280
type weather

35
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,759
but maybe not necessarily as good in

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,239
other kind of conditions

37
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,600
found during the summer and spring and

38
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,640
fall months

39
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,519
they have all-terrain or mud tires now

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,519
what you're noticing

41
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,599
here is they're really focused on kind

42
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,478
of off-road traction

43
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,599
and they have really large kind of deep

44
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,319
treads

45
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,919
large knobs on the tires so they're

46
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,438
great for being off-road in mud where

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
you need a lot of that kind of grip

48
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,879
and traction but they really don't

49
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,399
perform great

50
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,599
on road and their wear life on asphalt

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,200
is probably not the greatest

52
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,640
either so again these are a little bit

53
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,320
more specialized

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,079
for being off-road in this example here

55
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,679
and they're also typically oversized as

56
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,118
well then we have

57
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,079
drag racing uh radial tires or dot

58
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,959
legal tires these are tires that their

59
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,599
goal is to maximize acceleration

60
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,399
and to be able to allow a lot of contact

61
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,559
with the road

62
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
surface they've designed kind of for

63
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
drag racing a lot of traction you'll

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,399
notice the tread compared to our mud

65
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,439
tires

66
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,719
much reduced a lot more surface contact

67
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,079
on the road

68
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,159
now again these probably would not be

69
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,959
the best to be using in any sort of

70
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,400
wet or kind of wintry conditions but

71
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,159
they are considered d.o.t

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,800
legal meaning they do have the depth

73
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,560
required to technically be used on

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,719
dot roads now in comparison to those

75
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,400
we have racing slicks which their goal

76
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,280
is really to maximize

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,680
the surface contact that they have with

78
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,080
the

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,519
road surface however racing slicks or

80
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,959
true racing slicks are

81
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,759
never intended to be driven on the

82
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,120
street or exposed in near freezing

83
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,039
temperatures they have very minimal

84
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,959
area here where any water could be

85
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,318
sheeted off they have absolutely maximum

86
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,840
amount of contact

87
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,839
therefore used in a lot of racetracks

88
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,159
and autocross only special use

89
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,598
tires they have something called trailer

90
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,680
tires which on a quick look may look

91
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,598
very similar to an all-terrain tire

92
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,599
but they're specifically built for

93
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,000
stability durability and payloads are

94
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,158
not for

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,318
powered vehicles they're simply for it

96
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,919
to be put towed behind on a trailer

97
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,158
um so if you're looking at investing in

98
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,479
crime scene that has you know multiple

99
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,239
tire tracks and there was potentially a

100
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,079
trailer involved in some way

101
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,759
towing something these are going to have

102
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
a slightly different tread pattern so

103
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,439
they're going to be something to

104
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
investigate

105
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,280
and to be able to section out from the

106
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
towing vehicle

107
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,199
they have a temporary spare tires so

108
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,640
this is one that's

109
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,280
there can be full-size spares there can

110
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,199
be half spares or part spares

111
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,719
again differs by manufacturer but these

112
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,518
are simply light duty

113
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,120
special purpose temporary use tires so

114
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,920
not something you're typically going to

115
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,920
see

116
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,439
unless a vehicle involved in the crime

117
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,158
scene did have a flat and you'd have to

118
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,199
change it

119
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,479
and did have to put on a spare tire so

120
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,318
again just another

121
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,079
different way or different tread pattern

122
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,759
different tread tire type

123
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
to consider
