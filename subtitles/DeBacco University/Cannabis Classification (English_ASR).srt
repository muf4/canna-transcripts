00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,798
video here we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,640
cannabis classification

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,800
these three terms you might be familiar

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,480
with sativa indica and rudalus

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
we're going to define them and look at

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,120
them in a little bit more detail

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,440
here so first off cannabis

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,320
is a genus and it's likely to have

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,199
originated

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,760
in the wet habits of the asia continent

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,000
it's been

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,240
a long coexistence with mankind which

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,599
led to its early domestication

15
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,278
reason why it was domesticated is

16
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,480
because of its many uses and

17
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,960
possibilities

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
could be the source for textile fibers

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
it can also be utilized for its

20
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,000
psychoactive compounds and this early

21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,679
domestication has led to many

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,399
specializations of the plant

23
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,719
that fall into two main categories one

24
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,280
is

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,000
fiber and the other would be chemical

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,759
compounds

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,759
and breeding continues for increasing

28
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,878
diversity and specificity

29
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,439
within these general classifications now

30
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,519
cannabis

31
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,679
is dioecious so what does that mean it

32
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,800
means it produces distinctive male

33
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,280
and distinctive female plants each plant

34
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,718
from

35
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,879
the point that is an embryo is

36
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,478
genetically either male or female

37
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,159
it's visually identifiable by the

38
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,920
flowers that it will produce

39
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,359
in some isolated cases plants will

40
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,040
produce both male and female flowers

41
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,159
these are called hermaphrodites or

42
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,080
hermes

43
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,000
with chemical treatments it is possible

44
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,359
for a female plant to produce pollen

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,359
and also a male plant to actually

46
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,438
produce female

47
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,840
flowers but for the most part just talk

48
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,399
about no general

49
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,520
alterations is a distinctive male plant

50
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,118
or a distinctive meal plant others

51
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,798
plants may produce moniscus plants where

52
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:35,680
they produce male and female flowers on

53
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
the same plant

54
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,000
cannabis is not like that it's

55
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,079
distinctive male or female plants now

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
vernacular those sativas

57
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,199
those indicas israelis that we might be

58
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,359
familiar with

59
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
these are commonly used but however the

60
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,799
use of them is actually against

61
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,199
the recommendations by 20th century

62
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
botanist instead personal and cultural

63
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
biases prevailed and so did the use of

64
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,359
these terms

65
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,920
this is why they're so entrenched in the

66
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,478
cannabis culture even today

67
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,759
forming classifications of cannabis just

68
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,519
in general

69
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,359
remember that classification is really

70
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,038
based more on the morphology

71
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,959
not the physiology and remember

72
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,639
morphology is the study of size

73
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,920
shape and structure how it physically

74
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,958
looks maybe the phenotype you could

75
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,559
think about it that way

76
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,840
where physiology is related to the

77
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
function of the organism and how they

78
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,959
respond

79
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,560
to challenges so you kind of get like a

80
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,000
muscle would be the morphology whether

81
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,239
it's skeletal muscle

82
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,159
or cardiac muscle the physiology is how

83
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,680
that muscle actually contracts to kind

84
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,400
of give you that comparison between the

85
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,480
terms

86
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
morphology and physiology to predict

87
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,159
potential effects the cannabinoids and

88
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,680
terpenes which are the chemical profiles

89
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,519
should be identified you should be

90
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,400
looking at just how the plant looks

91
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,959
should be more concerned with the

92
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,879
chemical profiles each plant morphology

93
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,759
grouping has its own general advantages

94
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,840
but also has a set of drawbacks so

95
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,518
looking first at

96
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,200
sativas sativas in general grow really

97
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,560
tall four to fifteen feet

98
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,479
their internode spacing is about three

99
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,479
to six inches their leaves are long

100
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,079
and thin the advantages they produce

101
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,039
high biomasses they're commonly grown

102
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,560
outdoors

103
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,239
and produce better in climates with a

104
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,479
long warmer growing season

105
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
to allow that plant to get to its full

106
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,840
size the drawbacks are when grown

107
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,919
outdoors it can be more susceptible to

108
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,360
wind damage because it can get so tall

109
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,039
and can have increased time to flower

110
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,680
and mature compared to other

111
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,878
options this is also a photoperiod

112
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,840
dependent

113
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,598
strain here now the indicas these tend

114
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,360
to be smaller plants only about one to

115
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,878
six feet tall their internet spacing is

116
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,680
three inches or less

117
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,280
they have a wide leaf morphol morphology

118
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
these advantages it can be fit for

119
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,158
indoor growing operations that have

120
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,598
limited ceiling height

121
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,280
they have shorter flowering time so it

122
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,318
can allow for more plant cycles for an

123
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
indoor growl

124
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,679
and can often have quicker flowering

125
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,799
time than what i just talked about there

126
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,400
was sativas

127
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,239
performs well in colder climates with

128
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,319
shorter growing seasons however the

129
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,920
drawbacks are the total biomass produced

130
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,119
may be a little bit under

131
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,238
or reduced overall and this is another

132
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
photoperiod dependent strain here now

133
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,200
rudolphs are the autoflowers where

134
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,159
things get a little bit more interesting

135
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,000
shall we say

136
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,759
they tend to be very small plants only

137
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,560
one to three foot range tight internet

138
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,719
spacing

139
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,560
and frequent branching with small wide

140
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,039
leaves the advantages is their photo

141
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,640
period

142
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,120
independent meaning they will flower

143
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,359
based on a set number of days

144
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,639
they're not dependent on the duration of

145
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,079
sunlight that they're exposed to or

146
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,680
light that they're exposed to

147
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,358
however currently there's some limited

148
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,120
options in this category

149
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,799
but where those options do exist it can

150
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
be quite advantageous

151
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,600
however the drawbacks are they tend to

152
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
be smaller plants which can mean less

153
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,919
yield

154
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
until they produce less cannabinoids and

155
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,680
terpenes than other options

156
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,279
a day lost with these plants is a

157
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
greater portion of the total life cycle

158
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,478
because you can't make that up

159
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
where the photoperiod dependent ones if

160
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,439
you're growing indoors particularly

161
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,519
you can change when you're going to flip

162
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,600
them to flower these are predetermined

163
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,839
based on days old

164
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,360
and we also have hybrids and many

165
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,560
current plants are actually hybrids due

166
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,800
to the

167
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,918
secretive and often unknown breeding

168
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,280
that has occurred

169
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,879
and these general characters of these

170
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,159
hybrids are variable because it depends

171
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,839
on what plants were used for breeding

172
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
and what percentage it might be a sativa

173
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,959
indica

174
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,160
a 50 50 split or is it favorable one

175
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,399
versus the other

176
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,199
and again if it's a steven indica hybrid

177
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,038
or true

178
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,560
uh city of the indica hybrid it'll be

179
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,240
photoperiod dependent

180
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,399
advantages are the best of both worlds

181
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,079
you get the autoflowering plant behavior

182
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,758
potentially with still producing desired

183
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,758
cannabinoids and terpenes with

184
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,960
some hybrids this can expand the

185
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
cannabinoid interpreting profiles

186
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,079
produced if you're putting two

187
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,000
distinctly different lines together you

188
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,439
could get the best of both worlds

189
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,439
the drawback is you could also get the

190
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,120
worst of the both combinations that

191
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,399
you're putting together so there is some

192
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,800
time to breed these

193
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,638
and some kind of refinement that needs

194
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,079
to occur as well

195
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,918
now in general the summary kind of

196
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,680
indica versus sativa

197
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,198
kind of have some examples here have a

198
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
little resource here you can kind of go

199
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,960
through and look if you're interested

200
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,559
looking at just the general morphology

201
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,239
and some more apt to be kind of the

202
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,839
cannabinoid production some more for

203
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,960
fiber production somewhere for seed

204
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,399
production

205
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,959
so again these can have different

206
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,359
derivatives based on kind of

207
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,198
what they're known to be producing what

208
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,560
they produce in greater quantities you

209
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,360
can take a look at that there and we

210
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
have you know

211
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
the indicas the afghans some of those

212
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
relate to

213
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,959
where that plant may originate from

214
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,800
where that landmass land race may

215
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,560
originate as well

216
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,639
and this is the last characteristic here

217
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,839
of some cannabis strains looking at the

218
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,759
phenotypes

219
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,239
and then we're looking also at the

220
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,919
origins and aroma descriptions here

221
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,160
just to give you some idea of some of

222
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,359
the diversity that does occur within

223
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,560
cannabis you might look at all these

224
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
quickly and say oh they look very

225
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,639
similar

226
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,719
but as you start looking at them in more

227
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,038
detail you see different phenotypes

228
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
different morphologies develop different

229
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,318
different morphologies they also have

230
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,360
those different aromas descriptions

231
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,759
cannabinoids and

232
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,160
terpene profiles so keep that in mind

233
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,280
that cannabis is a very broad category

234
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,600
we want to be looking at some of the

235
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,000
specifics so we can ensure that we're

236
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,039
growing

237
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,319
the best variety or strain to fit our

238
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:56,159
particular conditions

239
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,160
or desired end products
