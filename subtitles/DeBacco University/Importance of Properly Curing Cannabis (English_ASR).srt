1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,080
on this debaco university video going to

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,559
go over the importance of properly

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,560
carrying

4
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,399
your cannabis buds because if you've

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,839
gotten them through to the very end you

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,359
don't want to reduce your quality you

7
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,080
want to maximize your return on

8
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,518
investment

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,920
and hopefully this video lecture will

10
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
help you do just that

11
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:25,118
[Music]

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,679
all right let's go over the importance

13
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:30,000
of properly curing cannabis buds

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,079
so first off curing in general well

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
often considered to be a blending of an

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,719
art

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,160
and a science there are some scientific

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,559
bases you should follow but it's kind of

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,279
that

20
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,959
properly curing process has a little bit

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,640
of an art on this to it

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,920
the grower a cure needs to control the

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
curing environment during this

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,160
post-harvest process regardless

25
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,799
of if the original plants were grown

26
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,718
indoors or outdoors so this applies to

27
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,399
both now indoor growers you might have a

28
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,000
little bit more of a visual nisk

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,120
that you're looking for outdoor growers

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
you might have a little bit more volume

31
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,919
to contend with

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
but still you should go through a curing

33
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,198
process and be mindful

34
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,799
of the importance of the steps presented

35
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,798
here so the

36
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,080
curing room environmental controls that

37
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
should be in place

38
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,000
similar to a drying room humidity goal

39
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
is around 62 percent and

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
you want to have a temperature control

41
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
as well typically maintaining that

42
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,280
around 60 degrees

43
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,478
fahrenheit now as i said indoor or

44
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,359
outdoors typically

45
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,079
the curing process will cure will occur

46
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,599
indoors

47
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,920
regardless of where the original plant

48
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,118
material was grown

49
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
because you want to avoid loss of

50
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,879
degradation so the point of that is to

51
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,840
have it grown indoors because you have

52
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,839
more control

53
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,359
you don't want to have this outdoors

54
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,880
some operations will utilize a

55
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,560
greenhouse or cold frame

56
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,399
then will have at least some protection

57
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,759
from the extremes of the outdoor

58
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,239
environment

59
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,759
so to avoid the loss is the cannabinoids

60
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,679
and terpenes found in the cannabis can

61
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,599
start to degrade soon after harvest

62
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,520
and the curing process helps preserve

63
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,039
the levels originally found in the plant

64
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,879
because you don't want to go through and

65
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,719
have all those kind of high quality

66
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,599
cannabinoids and terpenes and then just

67
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,599
lose them

68
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,438
to to a poor curing process you want to

69
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,438
maintain those levels

70
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,879
and not lose them to simple plant

71
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,038
breakdown

72
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,199
now after proper curing the risk of mold

73
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,399
developing is greatly reduced now i say

74
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,359
greatly reduced because it's not

75
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,879
eliminated

76
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,959
but if you go through a proper curing

77
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,239
process by reducing the humidity by

78
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,439
getting everything set up by drying

79
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,920
everything down evenly

80
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,000
the odds of the buds producing mold

81
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,280
after an efficient carrying process

82
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
is greatly reduced so the very last step

83
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,199
here within the

84
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,480
curing is you should involve sending out

85
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,719
a subsample

86
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,159
out for testing in a lab so depending on

87
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,159
how big your harvest is

88
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,680
will depend on the kind of how many buds

89
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,759
you take versus how many

90
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,680
buds you have you want to hold on to the

91
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,239
harvest slot that's represented by the

92
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
sample

93
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,640
that is sent to a third party lab only

94
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,639
move the end product to packaging and

95
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,559
shipping once the test results come back

96
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,839
and passing levels are achieved for all

97
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,439
parameters to ensure

98
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,598
a safe product is being sent to

99
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,959
consumers this is also a legal

100
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,238
requirement for labeling

101
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,759
so the reason why you want to hold those

102
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,439
products before you send them to the

103
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,158
packaging and shipping

104
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,439
can process is that if they fail you

105
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,280
want to make sure that you're not

106
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,359
packaging up a product

107
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,640
that may have failed one of the tests

108
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
also you want to make sure when you're

109
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,679
labeling

110
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,760
you're able to label the cannabinoid

111
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519
content label the terpene content

112
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,439
ensure it passed all the microbiology

113
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,120
all the heavy metals all the pesticides

114
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,719
all the testing that needs to occur so

115
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,400
that's a very important

116
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,840
last step that a lot of growers forget

117
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,039
about is that they so focus on the

118
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,280
drying and the curing

119
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,400
which is all very important but also

120
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,799
getting their product

121
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
tested so that the consumers looking to

122
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,239
purchase their product

123
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,839
can have the information presented to

124
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,719
them so they can make an educated

125
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,719
decision
