1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,878
looking at the all-important flower room

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,469
in cannabis production this is of course

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:09,960
a zoomed-in of flower here and deal

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:12,059
you'd want an entire room full of these

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:19,500
flowers to produce high amounts of

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:20,670
cannabinoids and terpenoids it it's

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,948
often referred to as the money-making

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,560
room like little bars of gold for the

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,210
plans even though its productivity

10
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,459
depends heavily on the treatment and

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,189
care during the time the plants fell

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,808
spent in the vegetative room so while

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,079
this is you know considered the money

14
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:39,269
room because you can consider the little

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,950
flowers here at little bars of gold but

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,780
really it's treating this plants well in

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,450
the vegetative room to prepare them for

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,390
this firing room is a very critical part

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,640
of this process so the lighting for a

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,948
flower room high pressure sodium lights

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,570
or full-spectrum LEDs are recommended

22
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:56,219
these high pressure sodium is kind of

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,899
give that kind of a yellowish look and

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,140
full spectrum LEDs would lose a very

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,399
bright and clean white light this should

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,929
be the largest room of both your

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,728
vegetative rooms and cloning rooms this

28
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,069
should be the largest because plants are

29
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:11,879
going to be full sized in this area I

30
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:14,129
want we could transplant on the plants

31
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,569
as they go in so plants we transplant

32
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:17,789
them to learn two containers which would

33
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,529
be the largest you're going to use since

34
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,850
plants will reach full size in this room

35
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,680
so some people as they go from

36
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:25,408
vegetative to flowering room may decide

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,549
to uh pot their plants however it's

38
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,228
important not to shock your plants

39
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,460
during this time so if you're transplant

40
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:31,319
at the same time you're moving the

41
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,879
plants you till have two days for

42
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,889
adjustment before changing the photo

43
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,569
period to twelve hours of light and 12

44
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,200
hours of darkness to help reduce plant

45
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:39,179
stress

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,500
be mindful the amount of changes so just

47
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,600
a container the photo period the room

48
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,250
locations could be slightly difference

49
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,798
in environmental conditions it's

50
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,170
indicative of the rooms stressors you

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,880
put on your plant at one time what many

52
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,649
growers will do is they'll first I'll

53
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,839
plot the plants and move them to larger

54
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,310
containers then move the plants and wait

55
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,409
a few days before flipping the photo

56
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,820
period to induce flowering this will

57
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,100
allow those plants a little bit of time

58
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,709
to adjust and not create much of a shock

59
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:07,679
or stress on those plants to help allow

60
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:10,709
them to maintain very high yields

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,950
despite going through a couple changes

62
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:17,750
here without causing any loss or due

63
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,750
this plants that's grower induced
