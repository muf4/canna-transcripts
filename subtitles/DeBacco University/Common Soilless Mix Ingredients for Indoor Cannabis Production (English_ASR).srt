1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
so i've been looking at soilless mixes

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,480
you probably know there's a lot of

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,559
ingredients that can be used so here on

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,719
debaco university i'm going to go over

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:17,640
some common soilless mix ingredients

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:20,559
for indoor cannabis production

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,240
[Music]

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,640
all right we got a lot of ingredients to

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,919
go over so let's get started here

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,920
so first off we're going to start with

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,519
peat moss so peat moss when we're

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,560
looking at peat moss it's an organic

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,280
product

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,759
it is mined from decomposing plants most

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
often

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,839
mosses in boggy areas commonly sourced

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,160
from canada

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,520
for use in the united states and this

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,519
does cause some growers

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,440
to select not to use this material

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,000
despite its benefits because they feel

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,000
that

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,759
it could be damaging the environment the

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
characteristics of the peat may

25
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,119
vary slightly depending on the species

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,679
of plant that was grown

27
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,759
in the area but overall it is a very

28
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,039
consistent product that you purchase

29
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,960
from batch to batch can be very

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,000
consistent very easy to spread

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,840
as again as it was warns here the ph

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,760
sometimes can be on the acidic side at

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,840
3.4 to 4.8

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,478
but you can easily mix in a little lime

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,159
there and balance that out

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,079
then there's a saccharomas here as we

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,080
see here this is uh

38
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,319
is several species of moss that can

39
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,000
inhibit bogs as well

40
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,239
not a commonly used material but does

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
maintain moisture and aeration

42
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,759
typically you'll see it used for a lot

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,560
of flowers particularly orchids in some

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,319
cases

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,719
can be used in seed starting mixes

46
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,399
because of its anti-fungal properties so

47
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,200
it does have some benefits but typically

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,359
not used on a large scale

49
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560
your bark products there's a whole

50
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,239
different ranges different

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,759
tree barks but basically they're all

52
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,158
wood-based materials

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,200
that are ground and are partially

54
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,200
composted

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,840
this is a less expensive alternative to

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,680
peat moss and does provide more aeration

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,920
but keep in mind with that aeration it

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,200
does dry out quicker for your roots

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,640
it can require higher nitrogen

60
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,280
fertilizers for the plants because its

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
breakdown

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,439
may take in or bind up some of that

63
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,320
nitrogen making it less available to

64
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,478
your plants

65
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,799
it's a common bedding material for pets

66
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,719
and animals so it can usually be found

67
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
and easily found and found in large

68
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,719
quantities

69
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,159
there's also perlite so perlite is white

70
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,439
volcanic rock

71
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,359
that was crushed and heated which

72
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,840
results in the material expanding kind

73
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,319
of like

74
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,439
puffs up added to many soilless mixes to

75
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,919
help improve drainage

76
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,159
and increase aeration perlite is

77
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,919
non-toxic sterile and also odorless

78
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,759
there are also different grades or sizes

79
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,719
to fit a variety of needs so make sure

80
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,840
you're purchasing

81
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,280
the perlite with the right size there

82
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,159
are coarser which are basically bigger

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,400
particles and then

84
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,680
finer particles as well so just make

85
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
sure you're approaching the right size

86
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,239
to fit your

87
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,000
intended use for those then there's also

88
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
a styrofoam beads which looks got a

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,159
quick look very similar perlite but

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
is a little different it is an

91
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,759
inexpensive substitute to perlite that

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,039
has many of the same properties such as

93
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,199
improved drainage

94
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,280
as well as aeration however unlike

95
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,958
perlite styrofoam will compact over time

96
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,080
and may float to the surface reducing

97
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,759
its effectiveness

98
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,440
so after many irrigation events you

99
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,199
might find those kind of styrofoam

100
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,280
beads start to kind of rise to the top

101
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,759
there so just be aware of that

102
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,479
for vermiculite another commonly used

103
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,479
one and

104
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,158
it is a very light kind of grayish puffy

105
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,639
substance here

106
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,000
that forms when mica chips are heated

107
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,158
vermiculite contains some potassium

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,799
magnesium calcium and even some silicate

109
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,239
that will slowly become available slowly

110
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,840
is the key word there that can be very

111
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,519
quickly available to your plants

112
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
it is used though to increase moisture

113
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,280
and nutrient retention in mixes

114
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,720
and is actually the preferred option

115
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,959
when looking at to grow

116
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,318
cannabis it just like the perlite comes

117
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
in different grades a fine

118
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,479
a medium and a large there the lard is

119
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,599
going to have a little bit greater

120
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,719
on the aeration properties compared to

121
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,878
the fine but again

122
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,000
experiment and see what may fit for your

123
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,598
particular

124
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,919
operation and what else you might be

125
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,919
mixing with it there's also coarse

126
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,598
sand that can be used large sand

127
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,000
particles hopefully washed

128
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,039
and or horticultural grade are added to

129
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,719
improve drainage

130
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,400
and weight in a potting mix these

131
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,318
are typically used for succulents such

132
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,959
as cacti and not very common with

133
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,119
cannabis

134
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,719
often the drainage rate is too fast and

135
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,360
the sand doesn't does tend to add a lot

136
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,120
of weight

137
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,400
to the containers to the mixes that you

138
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,079
might be growing in

139
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,638
in addition sand can damage

140
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,800
recirculating pumps

141
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,918
which can be another reason and probably

142
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,400
another common reason

143
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,039
why it's not necessarily used a whole

144
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,719
lot

145
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
simply because of the damage that can

146
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,199
occur to a different irrigation

147
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,560
equipment

148
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,919
that's why it's not used for cannabis

149
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
production as well as some other plant

150
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,680
production

151
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,360
as well to improve water retention if

152
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,040
that's your main goal there's actually a

153
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,639
water retention crystals

154
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,120
and they're small translucent granules

155
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,600
that are non-toxic non-biodegradable

156
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
and ph neutral these polymers can absorb

157
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,040
500 times their weight

158
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,560
in water and are added to reduce the

159
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,720
frequency needed for water

160
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,680
however keep in mind these crystals do

161
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
have a lifespan

162
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,240
of typically up to five years so if

163
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,679
you're reusing media the water retention

164
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,160
properties may change

165
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,680
as the polymers degrade over time if

166
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,680
adding to an existing padding media you

167
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,038
should always moisten before using

168
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,560
and add in accordance to the

169
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,599
manufacturer's directions you don't want

170
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,680
to over add

171
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
these if you're reusing soil and want to

172
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,038
add them to new soilless mix that you

173
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
might be using

174
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,959
there's also limestone so with limestone

175
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
that we're using this to kind of adjust

176
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,198
the ph to an optimum range and

177
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,959
can be a source of calcium and magnesium

178
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,038
though those calcium and magnesium all

179
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,519
present in the stone particles here

180
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,759
may not necessarily be plant available

181
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,519
often needs to counteract or needed to

182
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,400
counteract some of the peat moss

183
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,359
to create a final substrate with a plant

184
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,198
favorable

185
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,639
ph to make the nutrients available to

186
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,319
the plant as well

187
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,840
and then lastly getting to one of the

188
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,000
very common biological additives you

189
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,319
might see added to

190
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,360
soilless mix is mycorrhizae it's a

191
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,120
biological

192
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,280
growth enhancer that increases the yield

193
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,639
of flower fruit and vegetable plants by

194
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,559
extending the root system

195
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,960
to acquire the most available nutrients

196
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,280
in the soil mycorrhizae also can improve

197
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,399
resistance to root diseases and stresses

198
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,559
now how this actually works is that the

199
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,599
fungus develops a symbiotic relationship

200
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
with the plant in this case we're

201
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,319
showing a tree

202
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,919
in the sense that the tree is capturing

203
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,360
sunlight with photosynthesis producing

204
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,918
sugars and carbohydrates

205
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,000
the plant is giving those to the fungus

206
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,439
so the fungus has a good food source

207
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,759
in an exchange because this is a

208
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,560
symbiotic relationship the fungus is

209
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,879
able to get

210
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,720
water and minerals at a greater rate

211
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,120
than the roots because it's very fine

212
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,479
high surface area to volume ratio so it

213
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
is giving water and minerals to the

214
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,719
plant

215
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,160
so the plant can grow better and the

216
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
plant in exchange will give those

217
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
carbohydrates back to the fungus

218
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,758
so this is why it's commonly added to

219
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,120
soil mixes as well as field grown

220
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,319
operations as well

221
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,319
however it's effectiveness might be

222
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,360
limited in soils that are already very

223
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,400
high in nutrients

224
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,160
some because the plant doesn't

225
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,159
necessarily have to work that hard to

226
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,319
get the nutrients in the first place

227
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,599
but as one somatic relationship that

228
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,840
does occur in nature

229
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:03,439
where mycorrhizae in plants can have a

230
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,439
symbiotic relationship
