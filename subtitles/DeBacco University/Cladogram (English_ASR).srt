1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,580
now you're gonna be creating a cladogram

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:07,710
in class so hopefully this will be

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,490
helpful for you to indicate what it

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,888
should generally look like so clade here

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,350
looking at what an example of one is and

6
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,269
one example of one is here and both ends

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,830
the middle it's not basically if all

8
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,230
these little sections here is isn't a

9
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,629
complete area this here is a complete

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,778
kind of grouping same as this complete

11
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:30,118
grouping this one contains a split here

12
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,739
at divergent evolution but it ought

13
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:35,269
contains part of that so that's why it's

14
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,259
not considered a full classification set

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,570
so how things may look how to build a

16
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:40,890
family tree attack that may also enables

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,219
us to glimpse the evolutionary history

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,960
of life on Earth a phylogeny is the

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,570
evolutionary history of an organism ants

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,750
relationship to other species the

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,179
reconstruction and study of these

22
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,378
phylogenetic trees is also called

23
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:57,808
systematics we're going to be looking

24
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,899
only at one particular species and how

25
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,399
we look at separating that out do some

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,599
examples here of the divergent evolution

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,478
and how in certain environments and

28
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:13,559
predators made impacted changes that

29
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:16,109
occur over time so a common ancestors is

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,509
an important term it's any organism that

31
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,819
two or more descendents have in common

32
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,549
so I'm going to tell you what the common

33
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,618
ancestor is and through your cutouts

34
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,420
you're gonna have to determine what is

35
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,030
more closely related that common

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,879
ancestor and what is more distantly

37
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,859
related to that ancestor so the example

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,929
here of the wolf and all the dog species

39
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,750
that have derived from that this is all

40
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,270
of the dogs have this one single common

41
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,700
ancestor so might be related closer to

42
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:48,030
this than others but they all in some

43
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,850
way distantly or closely relate to the

44
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,460
common ancestor so how to build this

45
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,609
family trees clade here's a group of

46
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,798
organisms related by a descent on

47
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:00,090
cladistics is the construction of

48
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,399
biologically based on similarities

49
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,170
derived from common form a common

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,728
ancestor

51
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,009
examination of these characteristics

52
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:11,639
allows the construction and branching of

53
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:13,829
a cladogram so this is we'll be doing

54
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,989
again these two examples the

55
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,640
in here don't really fit the category

56
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,820
both of these do it can be a single

57
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,459
lineage or it can be the complete common

58
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,379
ancestor with the branch here here could

59
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,990
see here within this box there is no

60
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:31,019
necessary common ancestor the common

61
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,100
answer exists outside the box same here

62
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,689
this does not include all the

63
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,819
individuals that follow under this

64
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:38,400
particular common ancestor there's part

65
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,930
of reason why these don't classify over

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,150
here we would see the same left on the

67
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,550
title slide and again the two annoyance

68
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,280
are all-inclusive in the one in the

69
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,080
middle is not so we have two terms

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,259
called in-groups and out-groups

71
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,820
and his click Rams are not true family

72
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:55,530
trees so it's important to make that

73
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:57,659
separation or that distinction between

74
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,969
the tale they convey comparative

75
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:02,189
relationship information and its

76
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:04,949
clattering contains an out-group to

77
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:06,329
which the in-group is compared since we

78
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:09,030
are in grouped is all be closely related

79
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,480
and here's our out groups separated out

80
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,030
and use to compare to this in-group they

81
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,560
may have some similar some similar

82
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,050
properties because they all share the

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,430
same common ancestor but these are

84
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,040
grouped as the in-group these are

85
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,390
probably more closely related than

86
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:28,739
section a here considered the out-group

87
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:29,909
modern method attempts to assign extra

88
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,849
weight to the evolutionary significance

89
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:35,579
of key characteristics we call this

90
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:37,439
weighting characteristics so instead of

91
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,390
just kind of organizing we kind of give

92
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,219
weight to certain developments that may

93
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,319
be more complex that occurred all

94
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:44,969
phylogenies are constructed based on

95
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,919
large and lots of information about an

96
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:49,439
organism gathered gathered over the

97
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,259
years to constructors trees traditional

98
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,859
taxonomy used both ancestral and derived

99
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:58,199
characteristics class only use the

100
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,080
derived characteristics so again that

101
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,299
traditional versus the classification

102
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,090
which is a cladogram we see here giving

103
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,790
a little bit more weight to certain ways

104
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,860
to divide certain things here we see two

105
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:14,429
different ways of basically separating

106
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,739
out on things and the cladogram here is

107
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,370
using a little bit more specifics to

108
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:22,829
divide that so which approach is better

109
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,120
the traditional is when there's a lot of

110
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,310
information available to guide a

111
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,689
character weighting and the classics is

112
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,300
use when little information

113
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,790
how characters FEX the life over the

114
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,650
organism is used so in class you're just

115
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,760
going to get pictures so therefore we

116
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,620
can't really perform the traditional

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,269
taxonomy we don't have enough

118
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,949
information I don't know exactly the

119
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:43,259
ears or the duration of the species

120
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:45,209
diversities so that sort of undeveloped

121
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:49,319
is closed Essex's we're open to use

122
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:50,689
mainly based on phenotypic features so

123
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,730
two ways to classify at restful

124
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:56,519
vertebrates here notice here birds have

125
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,740
their own class and over here birds are

126
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,870
lumped with rough tiles so the

127
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,060
traditional alpha algae and taxonomic

128
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,980
classification if you remember flipping

129
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,079
me back that's when a lot of information

130
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,670
is used so we have a lot of information

131
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,889
where let's separate out birds into

132
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,120
their own separate category alpha we're

133
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,519
just kind of looking at comparative

134
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,490
features they get kind of lumped into

135
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,879
more with reptiles ovens separate out

136
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,500
into their own specific class here so

137
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,149
this is just important to keep in mind

138
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,930
the limitations of how we organize

139
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:26,729
things

140
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,530
it's simply based on the information

141
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,530
we're able to collect and use
