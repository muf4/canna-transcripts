1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,720
have you ever wondered how to set up a

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,959
regulator for carbon dioxide delivery

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:16,320
well this debaco university video will

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:17,760
cover just that

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,920
all right let's go over how to set up a

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,439
regulator for carbon dioxide delivery

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,880
and in this picture here we see we have

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,879
our carbon dioxide tank we have a

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,038
pressure gauge a flow meter

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,320
uh which is basically kind of regulation

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,760
of the process that

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,920
of the carbon monoxide that comes out of

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
the tank an adjustment knob to adjust

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,960
the flow

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,239
tubing and a solenoid to have that valve

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,759
come on and off

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,439
sadly looks like this tank is empty

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,159
looking at the pressure gauge but this

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,679
will

20
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,359
when you first have a bottle will come

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,000
up and give you the idea of the pressure

22
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,799
on your new bottle so first off what's

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,799
the function

24
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,119
of the regulator well to deliver the

25
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,959
actual carbon acid at a fixed flow rate

26
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,558
the control determines the frequency and

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,878
duration of delivery

28
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,159
but it's the regulator that actually is

29
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,718
having the rate

30
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,679
of delivery for simplicity the regulator

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,520
that would be

32
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,438
attached to a compressed co2 bottle will

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,799
be used for a model of comparison

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,279
as we can see that here and they're

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,360
relatively common and relatively simple

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,359
in their workings as well

37
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,118
so first off the general components of

38
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,040
that regulator as i mentioned

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,560
there's an attachment nut with a washer

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
inside and that's located right here and

41
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,680
here we see it on the bottle

42
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,840
it's always a good idea to have some

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,759
extra washers you have a bottle

44
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,759
pressure gauge and we can see that here

45
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,599
and also located right here

46
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,200
then the flow rate which is in the flow

47
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,078
meter i want to check the units on your

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
flow meter

49
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,118
an adjustment knob in this case it's

50
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,759
located here in this case would be right

51
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:37,680
here

52
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,280
the actual on off electronic valve or

53
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,720
solenoid we can see this one located

54
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
right here and this one's right off to

55
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,438
the side here

56
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,359
and the power cord that comes off this

57
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,199
goes directly to the controller

58
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,560
then we have the dispensing point of co2

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,240
which is located right here

60
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,079
with what we see some black tubing

61
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,359
attached and here we see the barb

62
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,438
fitting which would have

63
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,519
co2 dispensing tubing applied to it

64
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,758
right there the washer should be in here

65
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,718
and it's always advantageous and

66
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,239
recommended to have an extra so what are

67
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,839
the importance of these washers well we

68
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,679
can see them located right here

69
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,200
have extras replaced as needed in the

70
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,400
sense that this is what's going to stop

71
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,479
leaking carbon dioxide they're natural

72
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
they're nylon washers they're naturally

73
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,840
usually come right in there it

74
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,519
could have some extras because they

75
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,920
either sometimes can take a set

76
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,439
or they can fall off and get lost it's

77
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,759
really advantageous

78
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,079
to eliminate any wasting co2 by having

79
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,840
this washer in there

80
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
once connected and tightened so you go

81
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,080
through here we have our little regular

82
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,800
tightened up

83
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,640
here we have the extra washer zip tied

84
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,080
right to there good place to put them

85
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,399
you want to read over the regulator's

86
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,959
instructions but typically on an average

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,640
system

88
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
once all the systems are set up you can

89
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,079
turn on the carbon dioxide bottle by

90
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,958
slowly rotating the top to the on

91
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,519
position

92
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,039
avoid just opening the valve and the co2

93
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,480
rushing into the closed valve as this

94
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,199
could damage critical internal

95
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,479
components

96
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,719
i want to try to be as careful as

97
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,079
possible it's kind of just releasing

98
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,919
that carbon monoxide valve there's a lot

99
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
of pressure on very new bottles

100
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,199
you know the system is pressurized when

101
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,719
the gauge provides a pressure reading

102
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,399
so right here the carbon next bottle

103
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,560
will be off and this will come up

104
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,319
and give you a pressure reading a full

105
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,959
bottle the pressure should be around a

106
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,158
thousand psi or 7000 kpa

107
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,000
which is going to put you generally in

108
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,120
this kind of range right here

109
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,878
again depends on what they're filling

110
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,400
the bottles to don't expect this to go

111
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,679
all the way to full

112
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,920
it's going to be pretty much around a

113
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,400
thousand psi or under

114
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,280
and temperature will also have an effect

115
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,719
on that

116
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,719
once pressurized you should listen

117
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,199
carefully for any potential leaks

118
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,799
the system should be silent unless the

119
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,919
sensor's coming on and actually dosing

120
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,760
co2

121
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,679
even if you hear a slight hissing sound

122
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,359
investigate all connections

123
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,959
listen carefully to all areas of the

124
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,239
valve and if you cannot determine the

125
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799
exact area

126
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,400
there is a trick it's called the soapy

127
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,799
water trick if you hear that little

128
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,239
hissing snake noise so how does soapy

129
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,159
water come into play with this

130
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,120
well you take your regulator in areas

131
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:55,598
where you're going to have carbon

132
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,719
dioxide

133
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,719
moving and you add soapy water to it so

134
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,400
if you suspect the regulator

135
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,840
or some other part of the carbon dioxide

136
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,680
system has a leak

137
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
take some water and add some soap to it

138
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,400
and we can see that evident right here

139
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,598
you want the um level there you want to

140
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,360
look where the bubbles will

141
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,719
form because the soapy water with that

142
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,079
little leaking is going to cause little

143
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,918
bubbles to form

144
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,439
take the soapy water solution and apply

145
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,639
it to the regulator so add a little

146
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,800
soap to the water stir it up and then

147
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,720
just apply it over the regulator if air

148
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,639
is leaking you will see small bubbles

149
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,240
forming to pinpoint the exact area of

150
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,199
the leak and we can see this connection

151
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,040
right here

152
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,639
is failing because we're seeing the

153
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,360
little bubbles being blown

154
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,918
by the leaking escaping air here great

155
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,840
easy

156
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,758
quick little trick that i've used myself

157
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,679
and it works wonders

158
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,439
so what adjustments do you make to your

159
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,680
regulator you have all these options and

160
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,439
flow rates so what do you adjust it to

161
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,439
so regulating the flow rate can depend

162
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,959
on the size of the growing space

163
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,478
running the flow rate too high in a

164
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,239
small growth space will cause large

165
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:54,959
swings and carbon dioxide levels making

166
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,639
it

167
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,560
difficult to control the levels if they

168
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,560
go too high and get too low

169
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,160
running the flow rate too slow will

170
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,918
cause the target levels not to be

171
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,960
reached in the grow space

172
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:09,758
i typically find to not go above 10

173
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,000
cfm which is cubic feet per minute as

174
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,560
this

175
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,160
may cause the regulator to freeze up now

176
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,079
what does a regulator freeze up look

177
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
like well when you have one fail

178
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,120
and the rate goes way too fast for way

179
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,680
too long

180
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,120
you actually get a kind of strong

181
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,639
chilling effect

182
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,720
so this would be a prime example of

183
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,400
regulator freeze up this occurs when the

184
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
flow rate of carbon oxide is too fast

185
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,198
and there is a

186
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,399
strong cooling effect and we can see

187
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,600
right out of the bottle no problem but

188
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,560
where it's kind of here's where it's

189
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
kind of flowing that's where you're

190
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
having that strong cooling effect

191
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,240
the carboxate is cold when it goes from

192
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
the compressed state to the uncompressed

193
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,879
state and that's why you're getting that

194
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,800
massive chilling effect

195
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,439
this can happen even in hot grow spaces

196
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,960
such as greenhouses or high tunnels

197
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,639
if there is a problem with your

198
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,560
regulator the valve gets stuck open it

199
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,879
can cause the bottle to empty quickly

200
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
resulting in a frozen regulator this is

201
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,680
an example here of a regulator that had

202
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,160
failed got stuck

203
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,840
opened and closed and dispensed a lot of

204
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,400
carbon dioxide in a very short period of

205
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,159
time

206
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,839
resulting in regulator freeze up now the

207
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
suggested flow rates

208
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,959
this is just one example of one of the

209
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,599
regulators shooting for

210
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,719
1200 parts per million looking at your

211
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,319
cubic feet

212
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,520
of your growth space and then your cubic

213
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,520
feet per hour that you should be

214
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,439
injecting to try to give you an idea

215
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,758
of at least a starting point and then

216
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,680
you can make adjustments from there

217
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,879
so this is a great way to kind of look

218
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,199
at and understand

219
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,399
to be as efficient with your regulator

220
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,560
for enriching your

221
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,560
your growing space with carbon dioxide
