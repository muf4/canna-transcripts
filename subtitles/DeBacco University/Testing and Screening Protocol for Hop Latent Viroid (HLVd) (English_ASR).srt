1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,600
so Growers have been asking in this

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,759
debacco University video will provide

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,400
the answer for how to go about properly

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:12,019
testing and screening for hop latent

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,019
viroid in cannabis plants

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,039
[Music]

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,719
all right let's go over the testing and

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,859
screening protocol for hopolate and

9
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,839
viroid

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,760
so first off this is another great

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,899
resource to kind of look at provide a

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,640
link in the description on the

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,539
references and we're excited if you want

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,799
to go to this podcast interview style

15
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:36,000
information there I'm going to provide a

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,859
summary of this as well as some other

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,679
resources

18
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,479
so leaves was the standard when we're

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,519
looking at taking a sample take the

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,659
leaves and this does still work so I

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,760
want to think that that was null and

22
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,378
void does still work petioles of the

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,199
leaf which again is this kind of portion

24
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,238
right here are slightly better than the

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,500
actual just Leaf portions there so you

26
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,479
want to get really specific just those

27
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,759
actual portions there that's from the

28
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,378
node to the leaves that petiole is

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,960
probably the better portion of the leaf

30
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:06,179
however the latest data does indicate an

31
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,099
early accumulation in The Roots before

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,799
it saturates the plant and will show up

33
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,079
with reliability in the leaves and

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,600
throughout the plant and as this kind of

35
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,158
shows here on the diagram here we see

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,679
the success rate you know we're still

37
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,259
seeing you know upper success rates in

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,420
older growth petals upper clone stem but

39
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,239
look at those upper and lower root areas

40
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,759
near 100 there so particularly in early

41
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,339
areas if you can send a root sample to

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,959
your standard Testing Lab might be

43
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,060
worthwhile because it does seem to

44
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,679
accumulate at least early on they are in

45
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,840
a high degree

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,180
now mother plants if you're talking two

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,799
months or older four leaf or petal

48
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,840
samples at different areas of the plant

49
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,000
can work systematic sampling throughout

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,680
the canopy should be performed root

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,599
samples can be hard to get and do

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,799
physical damage so Leaf impedials are

53
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,959
preferred for the stage of plant

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,299
development not only to reduce the

55
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,978
damage but also because at this point

56
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,659
two months or older

57
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:02,879
probably got very good saturation

58
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,859
throughout the plant it takes about six

59
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,179
weeks for that hot plate and hard based

60
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,739
on the research I've seen to kind of

61
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,479
saturate that plant and they kind of

62
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,280
become systemically over the entire

63
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,560
plant so at this point if you have that

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,199
plant that's over two months old a leaf

65
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,580
or definitely a petiole sample uh can at

66
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,139
least including the petiole would be

67
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,940
advised because usually you have more

68
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,378
roots to worry about might be doing more

69
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,479
physical damage and you're still going

70
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,579
to get a reliable result

71
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,979
in contrast if you have a two month or

72
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,140
younger plant this is where you want to

73
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:32,759
go and Target a root sample this is

74
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,399
because the early accumulation is in

75
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,378
this location the viroid Lloyd load will

76
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,659
be elevated improving the odds for

77
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:41,280
detection on a younger plant in typical

78
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,019
younger plants easier to get at the

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
roots there might be less of them in

80
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,439
total but easier to get at them easier

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,500
to get a sample and it's going to

82
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,359
provide you with a more accurate result

83
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,280
now how often should you be doing this

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,260
what frequency well if you're going to

85
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,239
keep and or clone the plant that's

86
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,799
something to consider the ideal window

87
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,539
is about every two to four weeks to

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,580
ensure continual screening to catch

89
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:04,679
something early just because a plant

90
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,360
tests negative it may be below

91
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,879
detectable levels or it might be a very

92
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,739
small viral load pick early on we get to

93
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,658
flowering that's where you can kind of

94
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,539
see these thyroid plant stress and that

95
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,219
already become more prevalent two weeks

96
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,959
is best for actively growing plants four

97
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,459
weeks best for established plants as

98
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,800
long as they're strict quarantine

99
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,300
protocols in place you're limiting

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,519
access particularly to your mother

101
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,560
plants or your mother room

102
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,000
now that plant quarantine this is if you

103
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,039
bring plants in there should be at least

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,439
a 30-day quarantine to allow for proper

105
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,780
evaluation and screening but when I take

106
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,878
a screen sample when it first comes in

107
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,500
and then send another sample off even

108
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,298
after that initial one

109
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,340
this may be requires multiple screenings

110
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,959
to ensure the plants are clean and are

111
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,219
brought in as to part of the growing

112
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,598
operation the last thing I'm going to do

113
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:50,280
is take one plate that's infected bring

114
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,679
it into your operation and have it go

115
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,500
through and infect your entire operation

116
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,879
good month 30 days is a good quarantine

117
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,580
period

118
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,699
now if you get a positive uh isolate the

119
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,379
plant remove it a full plant tag bag and

120
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,639
dispose is advised and when you kind of

121
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,340
put that bag over you want to limit your

122
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,259
own contact With It cover over basically

123
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,420
seal it up put it all in the bag and

124
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,938
then discard it to the uh for this

125
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,680
dumpster remember this is transmitted by

126
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,899
physical damage and trap and sap

127
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,060
transfer so when you are transferring it

128
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,500
into the bag you want to eliminate any

129
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,240
contact you do have with that if you're

130
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,639
wearing gloves put those gloves in the

131
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,960
bag and discard everything together also

132
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,418
the roots can have some of the highest

133
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,638
thyroid loads so avoid transfer or

134
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:33,719
contact with these as well a lot of

135
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,819
people just think of the plant the

136
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,440
petiole yes but the roots as well the

137
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,300
substrate they're growing and you

138
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,160
definitely want to be treating that

139
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,478
because that is where some of the

140
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,919
highest amount of irates can be located

141
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,258
it's going to be treating that with

142
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:50,299
diligent care and making sure disposing

143
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,300
of that as well with your plant
