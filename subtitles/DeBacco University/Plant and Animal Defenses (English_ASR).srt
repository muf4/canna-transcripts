1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,839
i'm going to go over plant and animal

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,919
defenses that will involve physical

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,440
beings chemical means as well for

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,439
animals forms of mimicry

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,439
[Music]

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,919
all right let's get into some of the

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,560
plant and animal defenses here so

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,480
starting with the plant defenses well

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,239
plants have evolved many mechanisms to

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,880
defend themselves from herbivores which

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,640
is kind of a feeding they do have

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,439
developed morphological or what's

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,320
structural defenses such as thorns

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:41,280
spines and prickles uh basically all of

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,878
these are just deterrence from an animal

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,840
coming in or something coming in and

18
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,759
feeding on them we see here with the

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
structural defenses of the sharpness to

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,039
the leaves here of the american holly of

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,198
evolutionary modified stems or thorns on

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,600
the honey locust and here we see leaves

23
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,439
modified into spines in the form of this

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,760
barrel cactus

25
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,519
now plants have also evolved chemical

26
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,840
defenses these are secondary chemical

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,560
compounds they can be found in most

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,719
algae as well mustard oil so we can see

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,879
in this image here is one common one

30
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,679
this is found of course in the mustard

31
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,280
family the brassicacasia

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,920
now these plant defenses these mustard

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
oils themselves uh protect plants from

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
herbivores at least at first

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,960
however some have been able some insects

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,280
have evolved to be able to break down

37
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,118
the mustard oil and these insects were

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,920
able to use this new resource without

39
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,359
competing with other herbivores for it

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,519
and this is a great example of the

41
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,200
cabbage butterfly caterpillars what they

42
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,399
do is they basically consume the mustard

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,478
plant and

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,560
they don't have to worry about any other

45
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,719
competition because other insects

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,280
haven't evolved that kind of way to kind

47
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:52,000
of combat that mustard oil

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,118
now for animal defenses some animals

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,959
receive

50
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,519
an additional benefit from eating plants

51
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,039
rich in secondary chemical compounds so

52
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,959
for example the caterpillars of the

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,960
butterfly on the monarch butterfly in

54
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,280
particular concentrate and store these

55
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,759
compounds they then pass them on to the

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,840
adult and even the potential eggs of the

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,680
next generation birds that eat the

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,520
butterflies regurgitate them because

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
they're bad tastes here's an example of

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,719
an insect able to kind of take in those

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,080
um

62
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,280
those compounds

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,400
and carry them over and have a benefit

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,318
to be reduced predation on them

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
now we also have other animal defenses

66
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,719
such as cryptic coloration we're a color

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,719
that blends into the surrounding we have

68
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,598
the interim caterpillar we see here with

69
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,598
the owls the different frog colors uh

70
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,000
the flounder on the bottom here whether

71
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,318
it's a fine kind of sand or whether it's

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,080
a larger coarse uh gravelly base can

73
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,399
kind of easily blend into that and of

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,719
course that's gonna help reduce the odds

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,120
of predators finding them consuming them

76
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,919
and reducing their total numbers

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,759
we also have other animal defenses and

78
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,919
one that kind of goes completely against

79
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,479
the blending in is the having the showy

80
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,559
color the asymptomatic coloration this

81
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,598
is advertising poisonous nature as we

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,439
see here with these frogs these are very

83
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,199
poisonous frogs and they kind of instead

84
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,800
of blending in they go the opposite they

85
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,199
want to be loud and proud and kind of

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,920
show off and say i'm poisonous you can

87
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,199
easily see me stay away from me

88
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,280
there's other there's also other

89
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,039
chemical defenses so alkaloids are known

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,360
as having a varying degree of impacts on

91
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,519
humans low doses can have beneficial

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,920
effects high doses can be toxic or even

93
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,599
cause death alkaloids can be found in

94
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,518
the stings of bees or wasps which of

95
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,000
course can be deadly to some people but

96
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,000
in low doses may have potential for some

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,878
medical benefits in others and then we

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,039
have those

99
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,598
toxic alkaloids as we see here of course

100
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,359
with our very brightly colored frogs now

101
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,280
with mimicry it's a close

102
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,400
external resemblance of an animal or

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,158
plant to another

104
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,439
many non-poisonous species have evolved

105
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,679
to resemble poisonous ones with

106
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,759
asymptomatic coloration

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,080
bayesian mimicry here is a harmless

108
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,759
unprotected species mimics or resembles

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,319
the poisonous model that exhibits the

110
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,079
asymptomatic coloration if the mimics

111
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,079
are relatively scarce it will be avoided

112
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,640
by predators this concept is kind of

113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,360
like the sheep's in wolf clothing and

114
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,839
this

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,360
mimic must be present in low numbers for

116
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,799
this to be effective

117
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,120
the other form of nemacris called

118
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,040
malaria mimicry and this is where two or

119
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
more unrelated but protected species

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,680
come to resemble one another this a

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,319
group defense is achieved so we have the

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,600
viceroy butterfly which is an edible

123
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,000
butterfly and we have the monarch

124
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,520
butterfly which is very distasteful so

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
if we look at them here we see the

126
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,000
monarch on the left and the viceroy on

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,240
the right these are examples of two

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,800
species two butterflies resembling

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,879
malaria mimicry so now just a quick

130
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,600
comparison between

131
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,918
these two forms of mimicry we have the

132
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
bayesian mimicry which is a deadly and a

133
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,159
non-deadly species

134
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,680
and this is has deadly consequences for

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,000
the predator if they make the wrong

136
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,000
selection in contrast to that malaria

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
mammocrates we just saw both can be

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
eaten but one does not taste as good as

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,199
the other

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,520
is a lookalike and therefore is also

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,439
assumed not to taste good but the key

142
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,519
part with malaria mimicry is neither are

143
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,360
poisonous it's simply an unpleasant

144
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,879
experience for the predator we kind of

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,319
see that example here if you had

146
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,918
something really bitter or really sour

147
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,759
it's kind of an example here of just an

148
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,918
unpleasant experience would be malaria

149
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
mimicry bayesian mimicry is going to

150
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,079
have that deadly consequence

151
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,918
and then lastly we have mimicry which is

152
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,680
adaptations where one animal body part

153
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,439
comes to resemble another this type of

154
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
mimicry is used by both predator and

155
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,079
prey the example here we see eye spots

156
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,919
found in many butterflies moths fish and

157
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,240
other animals as well

158
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,839
the fish for example the eye spots uh

159
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,759
the predator typically will aim for the

160
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,239
eyes so in this case with the eye being

161
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,080
located towards the back uh the predator

162
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,600
will naturally go behind the eye and aim

163
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,159
for this area which of course will just

164
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,160
be water and that will allow the fish

165
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,560
here to escape from that degree of

166
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,319
predation so this hopefully gives you a

167
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,918
little bit of background here of some

168
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,919
plant in animal defenses
