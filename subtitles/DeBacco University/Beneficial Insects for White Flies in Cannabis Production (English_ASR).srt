1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
so if you've identified white flies in

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,639
your growing operation well this video

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,519
here on tobacco university is going to

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,239
provide you with some beneficial insects

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,199
to go about controlling those white fly

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,199
pests that you're dealing with

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,679
[Music]

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,598
all right let's get into beneficial

9
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,640
insects for white flies in cannabis

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,640
production

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,240
so first off this is all based off of a

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,558
research article that you're welcome to

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,359
check out following this reference and

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,039
link

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,200
to look at some more of the materials

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,119
methods and details provided in the

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,239
original study this will provide an

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,000
overview

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,919
so first off in general

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
insects can be a challenge in greenhouse

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,879
ah production typically the go-to for

22
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,198
insects has been synthetic chemicals

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,599
however due to strict legalizations and

24
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,759
restrictions of pesticides this is the

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,198
driving force and development of new

26
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,358
environmentally friendly but yet

27
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,280
profitable methods of pest control which

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,719
will be presented here

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,640
so first off there's some basics on the

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,599
greenhouse study this was conducted at

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,000
the agriculture university in athens

32
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,359
and their campus plants were grown in

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,560
two different greenhouses one is with

34
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,879
the beneficials one without the

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,759
beneficial insects this is the monash

36
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,199
variety that was utilized and this also

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,759
provides you with an idea of the

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
temperature and humidity fluctuations in

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,200
the greenhouses which is important when

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
you're looking at implementing a

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
biological control measure such as these

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,118
insects

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
so the release date for these insects

44
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,040
well three weeks after transplantation

45
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,798
beneficial insects were released in the

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
treatment greenhouse in order to assess

47
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,759
the efficiency of the biological pest

48
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,078
management the efficacy of the

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,759
biological pest management so white

50
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,438
flies gonna be the focus here again this

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,799
research study did look at others but

52
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,158
they were identified in the greenhouse

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,640
this is generally what they look like

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,640
your simple identification as well as

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,599
general symptoms to look for if you're

56
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,159
dealing with them as a potential pest

57
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,599
now the basic measurements that occurred

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,520
were visual estimations of the

59
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,839
infestation recording the pest species

60
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,239
populations and the comparisons of

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,759
infestations between the two greenhouses

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,920
keep in mind that only the nymphs and

63
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,839
adult stages of the pests were counted

64
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,919
not the egg stage for any of the insects

65
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,000
they studied if you're curious on what

66
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,399
insects you may have this is a common

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,560
group of insects that commonly affect

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,159
plants there so you can identify them

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,400
right here

70
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,759
through a quick visual guide

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,800
so how are the pest populations

72
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,639
determined uh of our white flies well

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
typically they were taken in the third

74
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,598
fifth seventh and ninth week of

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,800
production they were using a 1 600 times

76
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,479
a microscope to quantify the efficiency

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
of the beneficial insects and the

78
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,479
average pest populations were measured

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,480
on 10 plants 4 leaves per plant per

80
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,479
greenhouse in the study

81
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,238
so with any pest we're trying to deal

82
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,560
with it's very important to understand

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,080
the life cycle of that pest so you're

84
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,318
welcome to take a pause quick of the

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,840
video here to understand white flies in

86
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,119
general as well as their life cycle a

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,800
little bit more

88
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,719
keep in mind that some species of white

89
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,959
fly though can transmit viral diseases

90
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,199
to certain crops and have a broad host

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,640
range and colonize over 500 plant

92
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,878
species so because of this they are an

93
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,958
insect of concern and not only for the

94
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,679
physical damage that they can do but

95
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,080
also the vectoring they can do for other

96
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,519
diseases they can go through six stages

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
in about three weeks depending on the

98
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,200
temperature and that's we will find that

99
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,400
those temperatures are important

100
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,639
for determining the rate of spread or

101
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,120
increase in population one female can

102
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,679
lay up to 600 eggs in her lifetime so it

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,360
doesn't take very many to start a large

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,799
population

105
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,239
now there's different species actually

106
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,680
of white fly

107
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
as we look at them here they all are

108
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
flies that are the color white but this

109
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,119
gives you if you're seeing some it

110
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,159
doesn't quite match this exactly maybe

111
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,080
you have a silver leaf or maybe a banded

112
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,079
winged white fly there but again all

113
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
methods of control generally be the same

114
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
here this just gives you a little bit

115
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,360
more details of some of the specific

116
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,959
species you might be identifying in your

117
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,720
operation

118
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,479
now getting to those very important

119
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:12,560
beneficial insects so this one is um

120
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,798
aeromonices or ribacus and this is a

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,720
tiny wasp that lays eggs under the white

122
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,319
fly larvae or pupae kind of what they

123
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,040
look like their life cycle takes about

124
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,079
three weeks to complete there

125
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
so

126
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,400
keep that in mind as well as well as the

127
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,400
rates contact any of the areas you might

128
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,560
be looking at purchasing these from

129
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,519
for some more information on the rates

130
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,280
but this gives you a little bit more

131
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,198
information here the adults also kill

132
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,359
white flies by feeding on them

133
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,478
so a really great

134
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,439
target

135
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,199
for

136
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,560
white flies if you have them in your

137
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,040
growing operation

138
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,160
another species you might be using is in

139
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,759
incarcera which is a tiny a wasp there

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,160
their life cycle takes about three and a

141
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,759
half weeks to complete they paradise

142
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,720
hosts and turn into black or brownish

143
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,040
cases

144
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,040
they um these adult incarcera have a

145
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,120
black or brown head and thorax and a

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,280
yellow abdomen here if you're looking at

147
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,038
i spread them out and start to inspect

148
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,638
your plants maybe you hopefully you'll

149
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,038
see a couple of them

150
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,600
as far as hopefully to look out for the

151
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,199
good good beneficial insects

152
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
so how do they go about applying these

153
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,800
well the application is parasitic wasp

154
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,719
was achieved by hanging cardboard strips

155
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
which contain the parasites white fly

156
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
pupaes you can see right here hung right

157
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,919
there on the plants goes right over some

158
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,720
of the stems or some of the petioles

159
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,639
there makes it really easy to apply and

160
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
really easy to go through even a large

161
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
operation

162
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,519
so since this was a study let's look at

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,959
some of their numbers there was a slight

164
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,519
delay in the overall reduction in

165
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,680
numbers but by week nine there was only

166
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,198
an average of four white flies per plant

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,199
for the beneficial insect treatment

168
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,280
compared to over 70 in the control

169
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
plants so just make note of that slight

170
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,399
delay in reduction

171
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,918
don't think that if there's a slight

172
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,918
delay you're not going to get that final

173
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,120
you know treatment that you want

174
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,319
sometimes it just takes a little bit

175
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,120
longer with some of the beneficial

176
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,279
insects here so again we can see slight

177
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,280
delay but you know there was a reduction

178
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,879
even from week three to week five

179
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,559
even though not significantly

180
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,560
statistically different but you could

181
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,959
see week seven in week nine is where you

182
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,959
really saw those beneficial insects

183
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,439
really start to reduce those numbers in

184
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,959
an effective way so if you're applying

185
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,399
beneficial insects don't expect that

186
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,879
quick next day

187
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:22,159
knockdown but the long-term benefits by

188
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,159
this study will certainly be there

189
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,400
in this study did look at some other

190
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
populations of

191
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,439
insects and some other beneficials

192
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,360
you're welcome to check out other videos

193
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,959
on this channel as well but a continuous

194
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,560
reduction of all pest species was

195
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,719
observed throughout the experiment

196
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,560
approaching the zero plant value just to

197
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,400
kind of show on the graph okay right up

198
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,720
here you know maybe not reaching zero

199
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,799
but definitely approaching that zero

200
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,560
level there's a great thing

201
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,038
so are there beneficial insects worth it

202
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,639
well in short yes study results indicate

203
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,360
that beneficial insects could control

204
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,879
pest populations up to 100 percent pest

205
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,879
management with natural enemies is a

206
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:00,240
promising very effective safe method of

207
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,000
plant protection for applicator as well

208
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,439
but keep in mind if you are considering

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,038
these which again hopefully you are

210
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,879
proper pest identification is very

211
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,639
important since this will determine the

212
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,560
exact beneficial insects to be used you

213
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
want to make sure those species match up

214
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,199
this also requires frequent scouting

215
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,799
timing and rates of beneficial insects

216
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,319
are also important that's why i would

217
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,960
recommend you consult the people you're

218
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,080
being purchasing these insects from your

219
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,159
key part

220
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,519
is you have proper identification so you

221
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,400
ensure you're purchasing the right

222
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,839
insects that will do an effective job in

223
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,839
an environmentally sustainable way
