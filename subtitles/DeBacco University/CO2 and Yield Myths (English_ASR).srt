1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,278
okay co2 and yield myths so there's a

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,980
lot of kind of mystery sometimes around

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,080
co2 and there's a lot of myths and kind

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,700
of rumors about people who are looking

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,830
at supplementing with it and some of the

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,198
benefits that are claimed and made about

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,060
regarding carbon dioxide and richness so

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,890
first off yields are not always

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,899
increased with co2 so that goes against

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,010
a lot what you may hear Oh add co2

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,959
you'll get more yield

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,490
well precision addition of co2 to a

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,980
groom can dramatically increase your

14
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,659
yields it is true however this assumes

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,329
that all their factors such as water

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,219
light and nutrients are not limiting

17
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,350
factors that means is if you're not

18
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,300
feeding your plants right and they're

19
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,340
kind of nutrient hungry adding co2 is

20
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,349
not gonna help them at all also if your

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,969
light isn't intense enough they're not

22
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,070
getting enough light then that could

23
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,439
also by adding co2 now it helped

24
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,909
increase yields at all some girls who

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,488
run a minimum amount of light to save

26
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,078
money could reduce intensity could be

27
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,659
kind of playing right along the minimum

28
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,549
light that they give a plant or lights

29
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,919
are too far away we'll see poor results

30
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,259
due to light being a limiting factor so

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,210
that's just one example of adding co2

32
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,439
and not getting an increase in yield you

33
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:09,449
have to make sure everything else is

34
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,039
maximized detergent water your light

35
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,618
nutrients before you consider adding

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,299
termina exhale enrichment

37
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:17,280
now co2 levels in word world food

38
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,770
production so increasing co2 levels

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,519
which we can see here graph depicting

40
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:25,048
co2 levels from 1958 to 2009 measured

41
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,048
out Hawaiian can see a general trend

42
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,540
here vastly increasing so increase in

43
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,368
co2 levels in the atmosphere atmosphere

44
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,500
will increase world food production it's

45
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:37,049
often something that stated because hey

46
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,519
it's like look if I add more carbon

47
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,579
dioxide I'll be getting bigger plants

48
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,289
well that only holds true if the

49
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,029
limiting factor is actually the carbon

50
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,710
dioxide levels in not the water or

51
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,439
nutrients those plants are growing under

52
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,298
you can see here with a tree giving an

53
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,059
ambient which is about 400 parts per

54
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,240
million and then increasing that by 150

55
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,118
and over 300 and over 4 and 50 from the

56
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,259
ambience this would be about 850 we can

57
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,868
see that there can be an increasing

58
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,209
yield but again that means that or that

59
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:07,859
assumes that water and nutrients are not

60
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,538
limiting factors so that could impact

61
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,939
world food production in a sense that

62
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,708
water is often limiting in many areas

63
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,299
and also nutrients in the soil

64
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,609
so it doesn't necessarily mean

65
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:19,109
increasing co2 levels will automatically

66
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:22,260
lead to an increase in world food

67
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:24,030
production common myths about co2 relate

68
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,068
to cannabis while co2 does not increase

69
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,590
the percentage of cannabinoids THC or

70
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:31,318
CBD in the plant it can increase the

71
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,450
volume of cannabinoids produce but

72
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,598
doesn't increase the percentage so if

73
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:39,568
the plants gonna produce you know 12%

74
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:42,179
CBD and add co2 it's nothing - all

75
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:44,098
magazines didn't produce 20% it is gonna

76
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,500
consume simply because you'll have more

77
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,209
plant material there soo - results in

78
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,848
that more plant material which can

79
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,039
result in more total or more volume of

80
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:55,438
cannabinoids but will not change the

81
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,358
percentage of a plant so when we can

82
00:02:55,438 --> 00:03:00,628
plant more potent essentially it's

83
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:01,980
another myth there of co2 so co2 can

84
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:04,408
provide some great things we've got in

85
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,009
plants but it is not the one cure-all

86
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:07,009
fix all
