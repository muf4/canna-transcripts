1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,009
okay here we're investigate some of the

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,619
factors that shape climate so there's

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,719
many things that play into a particular

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,490
regions climate where I look at some of

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,829
those factors and how they influence it

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,320
so the key factors at shape in area's

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,079
climate and here I have some an outline

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,060
of the geographic or the world and some

9
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,858
of the typical climates we might be

10
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,809
familiar with or associate with

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,900
different areas and the key factors that

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:31,579
shape these are temperature water or

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:34,259
moisture content the sunlight soil and

14
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,000
wind now something might be weird we

15
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,820
think oats the earth resulted in the

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,399
sunlight but keep in mind of the

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,590
different amount of sunlight that may

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,870
occur and extremes it the pole regions

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,780
how during the summer the northern

20
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:51,119
hemisphere way up near the Arctic Ocean

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,640
Arctic Circle area they may get close to

22
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,218
23 24 almost 24 hours of continuous

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,710
sunlight in the winter they may get the

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,870
flip of that of almost complete day of

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,929
darkness so that can be what I referred

26
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,640
to as sunlight so take the first one

27
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:07,409
here temperature influences natural

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,769
plant life you may have heard of the

29
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,270
USDA Plant Hardiness zone map this is

30
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:14,429
referring to kind of the average

31
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,349
temperature in these various regions

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,080
might be a little hard to see here but

33
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:22,408
as you can see in general thing at the

34
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,560
colors these areas tend to be colder and

35
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,380
planted to be able to be harder to more

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,118
harsh or cold conditions than the colors

37
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,099
here tend to be more mild

38
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,340
they'll notice it's not a perfect kind

39
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:38,519
of based on degrees of latitude see this

40
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,150
kind of western coast area very similar

41
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:45,149
to the southern southeastern regions of

42
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,728
the United States this can be located or

43
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,219
based on proximity to water particular

44
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:52,739
oceans that has more mild in certain

45
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,539
areas or mountainous space and elevation

46
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:58,289
here where it's a lot colder a lot

47
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,299
further selves so land masses can also

48
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,100
shape climate there's as I mentioned

49
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,780
there's these coastal areas that tend to

50
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,699
have smaller changes in temperature and

51
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,840
mountains can have a large effect on

52
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,598
climate because it can cause

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,000
precipitation so we have the western and

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,068
kind of eastern slope well the western

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,870
slope kind of a look in here

56
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:18,688
western slope being here or Sierra

57
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,200
Nevadas western slope is going to be

58
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:23,128
much more lush a lot more water it's

59
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,018
gonna occur they're out more

60
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:26,968
precipitation is going to occur because

61
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:30,629
that water is basically getting kind of

62
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:33,000
squeezed out then in the eastern slope

63
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:34,798
or kind of the backside of in this case

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,348
the mountain range it can be a lot more

65
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:39,629
arid a lot drier is that moisture get

66
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:41,878
squeezed out on the western slope and

67
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:43,108
that leaves it less to be on the eastern

68
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:44,818
slope as that moisture kind of comes

69
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:48,689
down the other side of the mountain

70
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:52,348
creating a very dry particular type of

71
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:54,718
climate on that side we can kind of see

72
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:56,568
that here we call terrain shadow we're

73
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:59,718
looking at prevailing winds on the

74
00:02:56,568 --> 00:03:01,828
westward side kind of compressing and

75
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:04,739
condensing that water causing a lot of

76
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:07,260
rain events you can see very lush green

77
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,840
this here here about a satellite image

78
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,638
and then on that other side there the

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,468
dry air advances and there's something

80
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,260
called that rain shadow it's very arid

81
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:18,858
or dry we see that clearly evident here

82
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,628
with a lot less lush green plant growth

83
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:23,310
and we could see now we look back that

84
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:25,948
that western slope and easier so how

85
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,169
that western slope has a lot more those

86
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,629
trees a lot more vegetative growth in

87
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:32,549
the eastern so being a lot drier and

88
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:34,530
maybe this kind of sideways image of the

89
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,650
mountain kind of shows that western

90
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,120
slope here being squeezing all that

91
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,009
convincing all that water moisture out

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,949
and then that eastern slope being a lot

93
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:45,539
drier that rain shadow evident so we're

94
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:49,139
talking about water can see the water

95
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:52,378
here different types of rainfall or

96
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:54,319
looking at typically the Gulf of Mexico

97
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:58,709
region here can get a lot more rainfall

98
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:00,688
and overall the eastern half or kind of

99
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,329
that Mississippi River East tends to get

100
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:05,758
more rain than Mississippi River West

101
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:10,349
particular so again it can kind of

102
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:12,508
impact in areas climate also this kind

103
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:18,048
of shows a nice little progression here

104
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:20,939
of the different months and the typical

105
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,769
inches of rain or milliliters per day of

106
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:25,500
rain on average in the where that tends

107
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:28,019
to occur over the different months of

108
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,240
the year and we can see

109
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:33,810
really in this kind of band right here a

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,889
lot of rainfall overall this portion of

111
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,740
Africa the northern part of Africa

112
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:40,710
remains very dry this is there's a lot

113
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,259
of deserts located here aa system to be

114
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:46,198
much drier region and the closer to the

115
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,990
equator area here there's darker blues

116
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,590
indicating a greater amount of rainfall

117
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:55,050
on average per day over the courses of

118
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,209
the month that we see here than over the

119
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,560
year

120
00:04:56,209 --> 00:05:02,329
now sunlight as I said latitude is a

121
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,829
great influence on this looking at the

122
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,870
amount of sunlight that different

123
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:09,209
regions get again we would think that'd

124
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,530
be a nice kind of easy influence here

125
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,769
where equator gets the most and the

126
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:16,228
poles get the least there is some slight

127
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:18,689
variance amongst that but latitude does

128
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:20,668
have the greatest influence odds are the

129
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:23,129
closer you are to the equator the more

130
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:27,089
direct over the course of the year

131
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:29,819
sunlight will receive also have soil

132
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:31,918
type so those global soil regions and we

133
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,590
see these many different soil orders

134
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,019
these all have independent properties

135
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:38,459
and qualities some better for grown

136
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:41,008
crafts and better for supporting plant

137
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:43,769
life others not as supportive of plant

138
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:47,189
life and we can see that they are quite

139
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:49,589
variance across the globe here we see

140
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:53,218
some consistency and in northern regions

141
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:55,709
these dezerter regions here and to kind

142
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:57,959
of looked back at the water we see that

143
00:05:55,709 --> 00:06:00,000
also has an influence on the type of

144
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,060
soil that's present in the different

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,908
regions of the globe lastly we have wind

146
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,240
so land basin offshore at annual average

147
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:10,978
wind speed at about 80 meters and could

148
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,650
see areas that may be windier turns

149
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:16,500
areas it tend to be calmer this can also

150
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:19,198
impact the various climate also being

151
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,060
impact on weather companies could invest

152
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,419
for wind turbines as alternate forms of

153
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:27,149
energy but wind can also impact in

154
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:30,028
area's climate typically near the coast

155
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:32,549
it can be windier then more regions or

156
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:36,028
proximity to mountainous regions can

157
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,408
also impact the average wind speed in a

158
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,468
particular area

159
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:39,468
you
