1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,678
so in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,160
we're going to be looking at how to

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,559
select

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,080
cannabis plant material for breeding

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,320
what it comes down to is do you

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,839
start with seeds or do you start with

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,199
clones how you go about

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,800
making that selection so again as i said

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,399
there's two main options you can start

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,480
with seeds we have that

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,759
you know buy a little seed pack that

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,560
known variety you're going through and

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,560
starting them

14
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,640
or you could start with clones and both

15
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,320
again which one would you choose and

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,760
both have kind of pros and cons

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,238
associated with them

18
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,320
starting first with the seeds so if

19
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,959
you're selecting seeds to kind of start

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,079
with

21
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,520
these can have greater genetic

22
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,719
variability so it's important to keep

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,840
that in mind

24
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,120
but this is the more likely case where

25
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,160
to get male pollen or

26
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,159
pollinating plant feminized seeds would

27
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,078
not be recommended in this case

28
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,519
simply because it can limit your genetic

29
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,878
variability if you're looking at

30
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,559
breeding purposes

31
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,079
when selecting a strain with a limited

32
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,839
variability it's important so that you

33
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,359
have a better idea of the genetics

34
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,879
you'll be working with

35
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,160
so this is important where if you start

36
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,679
with feminized seed it's going to be

37
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,478
really hard to kind of get any

38
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,359
pollen or male plants to then go through

39
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,000
and

40
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,040
continue with the production of your own

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,478
seeds there

42
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240
so that's just an important

43
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,200
consideration feminist seeds have a lot

44
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,438
of benefits

45
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,960
not so much or limiting more when you

46
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,719
talk about breeding

47
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,879
so the other option here we can consider

48
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,719
is clones this would be a preferred

49
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,319
option for a female plant

50
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,879
but can also be a viable option

51
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,599
for males as well so just because it's a

52
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,759
male plant

53
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,280
assuming you can't clone it those can be

54
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,239
cloned in the same process and

55
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
procedures

56
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,319
as you would a female plant oftentimes

57
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,920
unique characteristics growers are

58
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,798
looking for are first noticed in a

59
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,118
female plant

60
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,159
that's why they typically are the first

61
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,280
ones kind of

62
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,799
that are taken as clones and isolated

63
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,040
males are typically not grown on such a

64
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,000
large scale and can sometimes be more

65
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,280
limiting there in a grow operation now

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
what's interesting here is we're looking

67
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,200
at a female plant that produces pollen

68
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
well this can limit your genetic

69
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
variability in some cases this may be

70
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,959
helpful for growers looking to generate

71
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,159
known genetics pollen so you find a

72
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,399
really unique female

73
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,400
kind of ways you can go about reverting

74
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,759
that so that female plant can actually

75
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
produce pollen

76
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,959
however this is going to basically

77
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,879
create a feminized seed so the true

78
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,479
long-term breeding possibilities are

79
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,318
limited for there

80
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,679
so again seeds create a little bit more

81
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,598
genetic variability

82
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,599
clones a little bit more of that kind of

83
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,679
exact replicate or copy

84
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,439
but if you're only cloning female plants

85
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,159
you may have to look into other methods

86
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:39,280
or ideas to generate a male plant to get

87
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,280
pollen to continue that breeding process
