1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
so even if you have the best controller

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,729
where you place the co2 sensor is

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,950
important for the function of your

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,990
system so here's a sensor we see you

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,820
liked it right here wired system goes

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,410
right to a controller box but where you

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,350
place that in your grow facility is

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,600
important to ensure that the controller

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,460
can work as efficiently as possible

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,080
so it's important to remember that it's

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,820
covered ox-head will sync because it's

12
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,038
heavier than air so it naturally wants

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,480
to go to the bottom of a grow space so

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,460
some growers like to inject it over

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,750
their plants kind of at the top and let

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,210
it kind of work its way through the

17
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,250
plants as it will naturally fall through

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,539
a system this is also important to keep

19
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,159
in mind when you're looking at mounting

20
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,920
or placing your sensor in a grow

21
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,569
facility so sensor placement is key

22
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,520
where you place your sensors important

23
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,799
to ensure the proper evaluation the grow

24
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,260
space environment or the sensor is only

25
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,229
gonna be as good as where you place it

26
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,509
be aware of exhaust systems as I have

27
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,488
here a carbon filter for exhaust on the

28
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:59,369
points of injection and the tubing

29
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:01,738
--here air circulation such as the fan

30
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,299
or other fans that you may have in the

31
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:07,048
positioning of the plants and how they

32
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:10,679
may impact certain aspects of the carbon

33
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,880
dioxide in air in general environment so

34
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,830
while there's a whole bunch of different

35
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,890
situations trying to give you the main

36
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,750
idea here also ideally a sensor should

37
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,060
be above the point or points of

38
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,579
injection so again this tubing comes

39
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,579
down here and runs through here is where

40
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:29,188
my co2 is injected as a result my sensor

41
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,109
is placed above that meaning because co2

42
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:33,149
is gonna sink it should fill up this

43
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,430
area and this will kind of give me the

44
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,200
assessment above that I put it below

45
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,840
here as soon as co2 starts injecting it

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
might be may get a false reading because

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,618
of the co2 naturally following by the

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,989
sensor you also want the sensor below

49
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:47,399
your ventilation so as I mentioned my

50
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,009
ventilations at the top here to help

51
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,840
exhaust the hot air on so as a result I

52
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,688
want to put it above that because if

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,640
that's pulling out co2 I don't want it

54
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,919
to be trying to fill the entire groats

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,478
in also you want to generally at plant

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,430
Heights I chose to come with the upper

57
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,500
portion of plant height here on so

58
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,540
that's also an important consideration I

59
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,060
also may want an area where it's getting

60
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,739
some fed or some mixing after the fan or

61
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,989
circulation that you have in the grow

62
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,860
facility so well each is unique these

63
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,990
are some general

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,700
ideas to keep in mind to ensure that

65
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,129
your carbon dioxide sensor is accurately

66
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:23,629
placed to allow efficient enrichment of

67
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:23,629
your grow space with carbon dioxide
