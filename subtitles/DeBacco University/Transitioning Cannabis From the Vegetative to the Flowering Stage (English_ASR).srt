00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,560
in this debaco university video we go

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,000
over transitioning your cannabis plants

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,399
from the vegetative stage

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,039
to the flowering stage while this may

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,199
depend

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,518
on the strain you're growing or indoor

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,919
or outdoor try to give you helpful hints

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
in all of those situations

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,719
[Music]

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,640
all right let's go over transitioning

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,679
cannabis from vegetative to the

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
flowering stage

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,920
sometimes called flipping the plants so

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,439
first off making the change what can

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,640
depend on the starting material

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,799
and what type of plant type you're

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,719
growing for example you're growing seeds

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,078
or do you start from clones or do you

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,920
have a photoperiod dependent

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,000
or do you have an autoflower that's

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,679
going to kind of influence significantly

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,359
when you make that change or if the

23
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,439
plants make that change on their own

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,519
you're dealing with autoflowers so

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,000
starting with these seeds compared to

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,079
clones comparison when timing the

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,878
transition be aware of the stage of root

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,878
development

29
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,558
clones tend to have an aggressive top or

30
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,238
vegetative growth

31
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,319
and they grow that a little bit faster

32
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,039
than seeds in the early stages

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,039
so be sure also to inspect the roots if

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
you're going through any plant

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,799
it's good to kind of take take it out of

36
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,159
the container if you can

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,840
inspect the roots make sure the root

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
structure one is looking healthy

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,960
and well developed before you're going

40
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,719
to put it under the strain

41
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,319
of going through the flipping from the

42
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,039
vegetative to the

43
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,478
flowering phase now if you're looking at

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
photoperiod dependent

45
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,078
so strains they change from the

46
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,159
vegetative to the flowering cycles

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,158
based purely on the duration of light or

48
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,759
photoperiod that they're exposed to

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,920
for autoflower strains remember the

50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,840
transitions based only on plant age

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
so knowing when you started them will

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,719
influence when they're naturally

53
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,640
going to go through that flip

54
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,840
automatically for those growing

55
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,079
photoperiod strains you have a little

56
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,399
bit more options particularly indoors

57
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,599
you're looking at when do you decide to

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,599
make that flip

59
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,399
of the photo period from the vegetative

60
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,798
stage to the flowering stage

61
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,320
so this can also depend as i said indoor

62
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,640
you have that control

63
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,158
outdoors not so much these transitions

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,439
will occur for both indoor and outdoor

65
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,280
locations

66
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,359
for indoor locations offer more grower

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,080
control of timing keep in mind for the

68
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,760
indoor

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,599
growers that might be growing grow tents

70
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,359
or ceiling height limited areas

71
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,280
plants are still continuing going to

72
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,599
grow vertically

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,560
after you change their vegetative to

74
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,519
flowering stage

75
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,640
so you don't want to run them all over

76
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,920
the top and then flip them things

77
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,119
they're going to stunt and stop

78
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,280
they're still going to continue to

79
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,400
stretch for outdoor growers

80
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,719
this will require growers to make

81
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,120
decisions based on the conditions

82
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,479
that are out of growers controls meaning

83
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,480
the photo period is going to change

84
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,238
naturally in the outdoor environment

85
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,759
what the outdoor grower has control over

86
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,920
is when they start those plants

87
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,079
when those plants go on the ground that

88
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,318
can influence and time it well with the

89
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,080
natural photo period to match up when

90
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:48,719
they'll naturally change a change over

91
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
and flip

92
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,318
to match so that you'll have a

93
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,560
well-developed plant

94
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,639
now the great debate of leaves versus

95
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,560
buzz vegetative or flowering

96
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,559
there is a need for a plant to produce

97
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,199
quality leaves and good morphology to be

98
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,039
able to support flowers or buds

99
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,639
while growers tend to focus on the buds

100
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,439
it is important to consider the general

101
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,039
plant shape

102
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,560
and productivity if you don't have

103
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,239
enough leaves to capture the sun

104
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,400
they won't have enough energy to push

105
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
quality buds or flowers

106
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,840
without a quality plant structure the

107
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,519
buds will suffer so timing is important

108
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,598
for growers to maximize

109
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,920
this total production so it is a little

110
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,518
bit of a balance documentation both in

111
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,759
written and picture form

112
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,840
to know when you flipped your plants is

113
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,759
important to try to determine

114
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,400
did you leave them the vegetative stage

115
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,158
too long did you not in the vegetative

116
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
stage long enough are you getting the

117
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,039
quality production

118
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,799
and are you getting it in the maximum

119
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,798
efficiency so hopefully this gives you a

120
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,640
little insight in making that transition

121
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,400
from the vegetative to the flowering

122
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,359
stage depending on your specific

123
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,360
conditions
