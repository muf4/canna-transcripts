00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
this tobacco University video is going

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,298
to provide you with an LED grow light

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,000
guide as well as some considerations

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:13,160
before purchasing due to the popularity

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,160
of LED lights gaining in the market

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,778
[Music]

7
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,519
now LED lights are getting popularity

8
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,399
many Growers think the LED lights are

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,618
the only option and while LED lights are

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,358
popular there may be more options to

11
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,780
consider than some Growers May realize

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,039
even within the LED light category also

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,780
there are other competitive light

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,600
sources that Growers may want to at

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,899
least consider before investing in their

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,700
chosen light and source for their plants

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,058
so let's just look at the LED light

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,579
category here the goal is to use a full

19
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,619
spectrum LED light plants can benefit

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,899
from more than just the par when it

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,339
comes to growing and they are when

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,859
they're looking at producing secondary

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,260
compounds par is the 400 to 700

24
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,198
nanometers wavelengths of light but even

25
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,239
below 400 and even above 700 is showing

26
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,298
some promise for those secondary

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,459
compounds avoid high power purple LED

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,100
lights that we can see located right

29
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,539
over here that makes daily plant checks

30
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,280
more difficult because it's that

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,860
artificial kind of look to the plants

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,900
it's also a limited Spectrum even though

33
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,599
it's more focused on the photosynthetic

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,540
spectrum they are missing some of those

35
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,099
par readings that go beyond that so

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,420
there are ways you can switch it to a

37
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:31,919
full white light so you can see your

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,379
plants take pictures and be able to

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,840
inspect them but at the same time these

40
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,938
purple lights while producing High On a

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,680
par meter may be missing some of those

42
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,379
spectrums that plants may actually need

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,880
and utilize to maximize their potential

44
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,879
so what are we considering when we're

45
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,640
looking at our LED lights well remember

46
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,500
that led lights produce less heat and I

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,478
stress that means this does not mean no

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,399
heat LED lights still produce a fair

49
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,280
amount of heat but it's less compared to

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,960
say a high pressure sodium longevity

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,820
we're looking at LED lights compared to

52
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,158
other light sources the hours that led

53
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,438
lights produce at least 80 percent of

54
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,618
the original output is typically longer

55
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,060
and in some cases much longer is an

56
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:14,400
example of one being much longer would

57
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,400
be high pressure sodium lights they get

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,420
about 80 to about 5 000 hours while LED

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,459
lights could be up to 75 000 hours oh if

60
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,979
you're looking at purchasing an LED

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,340
light make sure you avoid internal fans

62
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:31,439
if the light does require internal fans

63
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,539
the fan tends to fail and this can cause

64
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,719
overheating and ultimately the light

65
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,818
failure the LED technology of the

66
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,878
lighting source is outlasting some of

67
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:43,979
the motorized fan technology typically

68
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,318
those mechanical fans it's simply just

69
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,899
they fail sooner than the diodes do and

70
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,060
that results in the overheating and then

71
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,920
loss of fixtures or issues in that

72
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,439
regard so try to get one that has

73
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,399
natural heat sinks to cool the lighting

74
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,259
source

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,599
now the coverage area another important

76
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:04,318
uh consideration Growers need to check

77
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:07,919
the ppf map which is looking at the

78
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:10,079
photon flux area basically the amount of

79
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,458
photons that are being spread over the

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,080
growing area

81
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,939
for any lights you want to consider this

82
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,099
even with LED lights as there's often

83
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,840
less coverage area than other high

84
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,299
intensity lights that may have been you

85
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,920
may have been utilizing in the past also

86
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,599
check the suggested mounting height from

87
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,059
the plants that might be different than

88
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,219
other lighting sources often A reduced

89
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,259
distance from the plant tops can also

90
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:32,759
limit the coverage area so you just want

91
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,158
to make sure that you're allowing all

92
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,598
corners and Central parts and all areas

93
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,299
of your growing space to get the same

94
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:40,798
intensity of the high quality light that

95
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,959
the plants need

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,760
now 101 Replacements are coming on the

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
market and those are looking at really

98
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,239
one-on-one replacements for high

99
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,099
pressure sodium lights most growing

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,739
areas especially flying areas are based

101
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:54,658
off high pressure sodium lights few LED

102
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,519
lights are considered to be a one-to-one

103
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:58,620
replacement HPS lights high pressure

104
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,799
sodium lights this is especially true

105
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,599
for the thousand watt HPS lights however

106
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,879
there are some models being developed to

107
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,339
allow for this easy replacement as a

108
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:11,098
grower decide to change from a dominated

109
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,680
HPS lighting to an LED lighting source

110
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:15,298
for their grow room just be ready to pay

111
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,858
a high upfront cost for these types of

112
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,019
fixtures and be willing to adjust your

113
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,879
growing conditions as a side note I'll

114
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,918
have a separate video on this channel

115
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,478
that goes over this one-to-one

116
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,039
replacement idea if you're looking at

117
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,279
making a grow room change from high

118
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,139
pressure sodium lights to an LED based

119
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,219
light and more than just the lights are

120
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,560
going to have to change different

121
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,600
aspects of the growing area so search

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,600
the channel for that video as well

123
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,060
looking LED customized Spectrum so in

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,320
the case where this is an example of

125
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,478
where lighting technology is getting

126
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,339
ahead of the plant science knowing the

127
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,019
best lighting Spectrum a recipe is still

128
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,179
being researched and while it is

129
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:54,000
possible to make changes to UV light

130
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,579
violet light blue light green light deep

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,079
red and cool whites that while that is

132
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,060
all possible because of the LED light

133
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,579
technology knowing the exact plant

134
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,379
science of it or what is best of a

135
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,779
benefit for the plants is still being

136
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,819
researched there is research that does

137
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,500
indicate that UV ultraviolet light and

138
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,540
far red light does have an impact on

139
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,639
plant growth and development so there is

140
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,100
some indication that yes this could

141
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,620
positively impact your plants or just

142
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,020
haven't hashed out all of the exact

143
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,160
recipes it would be ideal up to this

144
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:24,779
point

145
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,880
now when we're looking at LED lights

146
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,918
there are LED panels these are the most

147
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,418
common type of LED light fixture they

148
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:32,399
typically include heat sinks and a

149
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,258
driver as a single unit as they said

150
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,239
heatsinks are a key part usually mounted

151
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:38,100
on the top they're like fins and help

152
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,800
cool the light you want to avoid panels

153
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,259
that have fans that are required for the

154
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,800
cooling process so we're talking about

155
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:49,439
LED lights there's this panel design in

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,180
addition there's also LED light bars and

157
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,879
they look like this as the name implies

158
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,500
they are kind of bar lights

159
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,600
and they're slightly less expensive than

160
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,639
the panels the bar is a single row of

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,620
diodes that come in different spectrums

162
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,840
single bars should be used in small

163
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,418
growing areas as or as an additional

164
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,859
supplemental light source wrong area the

165
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:09,599
shape makes them a good choice for

166
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,419
smaller particularly rectangular growing

167
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,240
spaces for example shown here is like a

168
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:17,099
4x2 grow tent multiple bars linked

169
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,538
together can be used on larger scale

170
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,580
operations particularly when we're

171
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:21,899
looking at vertical farming and the

172
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,939
spacing of the bars does help the

173
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:26,758
cooling process as well this one here

174
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,319
has a lot of metal fins again to act as

175
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,538
heat sinks

176
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,660
then there's LED bulbs that we can see

177
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:35,818
on here these are these can be an easy

178
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,880
replacement if someone was using the CFL

179
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,979
typical bulbs there but Growers may use

180
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,959
these for mixing and matching spectrums

181
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:44,579
but a reflective Hood would be

182
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,038
recommended to increase the efficiency

183
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,659
even though these aren't tend to be not

184
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,279
the most efficient light source anyway

185
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,840
it's a big want to look at potentially

186
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,179
some of the other options but these do

187
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,519
exist and be aware again of those High

188
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,379
par lights there could be used though

189
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,659
for supplementing spectrums but maybe

190
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,219
not as your base light

191
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,220
and just some warnings if you're looking

192
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,319
at making this switch to LED lights the

193
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,360
technology is continuing to improve at a

194
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,680
rapid rate current Technologies ahead of

195
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,379
the plant science particularly when it

196
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,699
comes to optimizing plant spectrums the

197
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,680
coverage area for each light is

198
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,360
important as sometimes the reduced plant

199
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,519
to light spacing can limit the coverage

200
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,199
area that's distance that you want to

201
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,758
keep those lights from your plants

202
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,919
the cost of the light does need to be

203
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,720
considered since most of the time good

204
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,758
lights are not cheap and cheap lights

205
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,740
simply are not effective

206
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,900
some research is showing that leaf

207
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,759
temperature can also impact plant

208
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:37,679
productivity so if you are switching

209
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,220
from a high intensity light such as an

210
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,019
HPS you can expect some differences and

211
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,639
your HVAC system will likely need

212
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,620
changes and again I'm gonna have another

213
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,000
video going into the details of that the

214
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,560
goal here is to provide you with a

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,019
little bit of background of some of the

216
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,699
different LED light classifications you

217
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:56,478
might be considering to purchase for

218
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,478
your growing operation
