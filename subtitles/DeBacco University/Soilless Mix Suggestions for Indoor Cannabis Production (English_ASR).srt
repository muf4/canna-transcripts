1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
if you're thinking about using soilless

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,000
mix for your indoor cannabis production

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,839
here in tobacco university i want to

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,480
provide you with some specifics and some

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:17,920
tips

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:17,920
to help you with that process

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,000
all right let's get into some soils mix

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,480
suggestions for indoor cannabis

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
plant production so first off i want to

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,118
understand that there are as i'm sure

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
you are well aware

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,839
many soilless mix options this category

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,000
has many options within this broad

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,039
title here growers will find one brand

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,880
and stick with this and different

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,799
growers have different favorites

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,040
however remember that manufacturers can

18
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,000
change unexpectedly

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,878
modify the recipe or discontinue a

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,719
soil's mix

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,640
line at any time so you want to be well

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,800
aware and well diversified

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
so you are not have to relearn

24
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,238
everything just because the manufacturer

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,079
decide to make a change

26
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,679
most general purpose soilless mixes will

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,039
work out just fine for cannabis plant

28
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,799
productions i don't think you need to

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,960
have necessarily only one

30
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,438
and there's some common brands pro-mix

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,680
bx botanic care mix online

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,759
fox farm for example the happy frog

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
listed are shown right above me here

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
these are just some examples of some

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,359
common ones that you may be familiar

36
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,399
with

37
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:19,759
or may have seen now there's a soil mix

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,320
recipe for cannabis so at the in the

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,840
description to provide with some links

40
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,798
to some references you're welcome to

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,400
check those out

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,240
so i got some of the information here as

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,880
well as i cite a source at the very last

44
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,559
slide

45
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,920
you're welcome to check out as well for

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,118
more specifics

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,519
but the following here is listed for

48
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,359
about one cubic foot volume for easy

49
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,280
scaling up to match your volume

50
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,799
as far as kind of what you should be

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,719
kind of mixing in there

52
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,640
again directed more towards the cannabis

53
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,239
plant production and please take this as

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,640
only a suggestion there are many

55
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,239
uh different other options out there

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,840
this one is very simple that's why i

57
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,078
like it 50 percent peat

58
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,759
fifty percent vermiculite five grams of

59
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,359
dolomitic limestone to counterbalance

60
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,319
some of the acidity that the peat may be

61
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,359
bringing in

62
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,239
and ten percent uh ten grams of gypsum

63
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,359
there to help

64
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,959
uh supply some calcium uh to the plant

65
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,719
properties of this medium mix allows for

66
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,920
greater balance in aeration and also

67
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,680
water retention

68
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,919
a lot of growers will supplement the

69
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,159
vermiculite for perlite but vermiculite

70
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,799
can potentially supply some silicate for

71
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,039
the plant

72
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
as well now which i like that one as i

73
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,239
said very easy

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
fifty percent fifty percent vermiculite

75
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,560
50 grams dolomitic limestone 10 grams

76
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,239
gypsum for that one cubic foot

77
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,000
you'll notice there are others that go a

78
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,080
little bit more in detail

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,159
some develop these super soil recipes

80
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,000
they list all these ingredients

81
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,239
in the actuality as far as the plant's

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
concerned many of these details may not

83
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,959
be needed or may not be really

84
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,560
benefiting the plant

85
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,239
starting with this very basic formula

86
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,598
and building from there would be my

87
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,120
suggestion

88
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,799
now that vermiculite that i mentioned

89
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,719
you know what's it kind of what's it

90
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,840
look like well it's kind of got this

91
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,039
um kind of that goldish kind of brownish

92
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,680
kind of look to it

93
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,519
uh what's so great about it well it has

94
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,080
a lot of water holding capacity

95
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,200
in cec which stands for cation exchange

96
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
capacity

97
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,119
which has silica in it and it's likely

98
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,719
to benefit cannabis unlike other

99
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
substrate products particularly perlite

100
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,560
which i know is commonly used

101
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,079
however vaguely use if you haven't heard

102
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,840
of it is actually becoming used

103
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,120
less and less mainly due to its

104
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,120
increasing in

105
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
its cost and many growers and

106
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,158
manufacturers are utilizing perlite as a

107
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,959
substitute

108
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,079
so if given the option for a better kind

109
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,920
of

110
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,599
material to add a vermiculite would be

111
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,119
better than perlite but it might be a

112
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:33,439
little harder to find when you do find

113
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
it

114
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,719
you might find it to be a little more

115
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,599
costly

116
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,120
now the peat moss example here has

117
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,000
properties that are conducive to

118
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,080
supporting

119
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
plant growth however some are looking

120
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,000
for alternatives in

121
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,840
supplements with some turning to

122
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,519
shredded wood and other products

123
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,598
coconut coir is a good additive as well

124
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,719
but has slightly different properties

125
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,479
so again looking at a good kind of base

126
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,158
property use this peat moss

127
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,759
this is a picture i've taken myself

128
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,959
these are the ones that i've used and

129
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,120
quite a good

130
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,560
product here very easy to apply very

131
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,799
consistent

132
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,158
and usually easy to get overall but

133
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,080
again there could be some environmental

134
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,199
concerns by some people

135
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,400
so optimizing the ph so in that mix

136
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,279
there what's very important is that you

137
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,000
have a good

138
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,518
uh optimized ph some peat can have a

139
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,959
natural

140
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,720
ph of around 3.8 which is very acidic

141
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,879
however when mixed with the vermiculite

142
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,880
it usually will end up around 4.5

143
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,240
but remember our target peach is around

144
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,519
6.0

145
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
6.0 6.3 6.5 typically somewhere in that

146
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,918
range

147
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,759
to achieve this dolomitic limestone

148
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,680
which is naturally high in magnesium it

149
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,680
needs to be added to raise the ph

150
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,918
that dolmetic lime would be advised over

151
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,400
calcitic or um hydrated lime

152
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,399
adding gypsum will add some calcium and

153
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,839
sulfur in a slow release rate and it's a

154
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,799
good kind of general additive there

155
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,198
that's why it was mentioned

156
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,478
in the previous recipe if you're looking

157
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,079
for that reference not only in the

158
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,359
description but here i've provided you

159
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,959
another youtube video

160
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,038
link that you're welcome to again take a

161
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,560
look at there but this is intended to be

162
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,399
that quick little summary

163
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,560
kind of of giving you that quick little

164
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,799
rundown of if you're looking at going

165
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,038
through and kind of using a soilless mix

166
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,720
hopefully this gives you a quick recipe

167
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,719
to get started with that process
