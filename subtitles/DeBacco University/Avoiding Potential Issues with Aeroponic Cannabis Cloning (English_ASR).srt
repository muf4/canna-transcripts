00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,839
here i'm going to go over

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,800
tips and tricks to help you avoid

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:14,919
potential issues with aeroponic cannabis

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,719
[Music]

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,079
cloning

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,919
all right if you've tried an aeroponic

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,079
liner or didn't have great success

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,960
i may fall into one of these issues if

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,000
you are looking at starting with

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,439
aeroponic cloning

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,679
hopefully this will help you avoid

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,198
potential issues early on

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,599
so starting with some of the common

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,120
issues well for us is ph imbalance

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880
many times growers they have something

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,399
that's too acidic or too basic

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,160
not realize it so this is why it's

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,039
always important to have a good monitor

20
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,558
system

21
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,640
also want to make sure your temperature

22
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,919
is in the acceptable range if it's not

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
that's going to cause potential your

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,079
roots to burn if it's too hot or

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
not really form at any great rate if

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,600
it's too cold

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,359
also nutrient levels tend to be more on

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,559
the excessive side with what i see some

29
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,878
growers

30
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,799
everyone has their own kind of gauge or

31
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,159
idea i would first start with any

32
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,279
solutions you're adding to definitely

33
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,878
follow the manufacturer's

34
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,159
recommendations or

35
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,438
even go less do not go more so what's

36
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,080
the problem solving how can

37
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,118
you avoid these issues well i use the

38
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,280
blue labs guardian

39
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,799
monitor here it provides live readings

40
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
of the parts per million

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,400
it could be ec or tds whatever you

42
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,599
choose the temperature could be in

43
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,200
fahrenheit or celsius

44
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:25,839
as well as the ph so this is a great

45
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,759
way to look at three main factors

46
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,920
environmental factors for cloning

47
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,280
to help ensure all of them are within

48
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,920
your preset acceptable target ranges

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,560
now i'm sure must have on hand and again

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,079
there's

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,159
many things growers should have on hand

52
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,959
but these are some of the very basics

53
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,359
the most basic would be a ph up and a ph

54
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,118
down

55
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,840
solution to ensure you're able to keep

56
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,239
that ph within your target range

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,399
also standard lotus blend of nutrients

58
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,920
can be an a great addition

59
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,000
again you don't need a ton of different

60
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,960
nutrients this clonex clone solution

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,040
really can work

62
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,879
sometimes even just plain water does

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,520
everything set up ahead of time

64
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,078
ph wise temperature wise uh that can

65
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,920
also be

66
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,038
effective but adding a little nutrients

67
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,640
can help increase your odds of success

68
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,159
now there are some advanced options so

69
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,159
depending on what level

70
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,598
you want to get into while there's no

71
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,359
substitute for basically checking your

72
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,199
plants there are some additional options

73
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,480
that can help reduce the time from when

74
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,318
something goes wrong

75
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,560
to when you know about it you could send

76
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,598
in certain alarms or alerts get text

77
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,560
messages get

78
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,399
automatic emails sent out to people and

79
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,159
not only would you be aware of it

80
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,840
there's even options where you can get

81
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,159
automatic dosing where if the computer

82
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,239
realizes the ph is coming up too high

83
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,840
can add particular solutions to help

84
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,239
bring that ph back down

85
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
to your acceptable range to avoid large

86
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,680
swings

87
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,159
in potential environmental conditions

88
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
that would reduce your routing success

89
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,439
as i said there's monitors with alerts

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and there's many different ones you can

91
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,840
alert

92
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you want to conditions outside the

93
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,479
program acceptable range that you have

94
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,039
set can also be sent immediately to use

95
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,439
your where

96
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,639
live as it happens so you can be right

97
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,878
there and hopefully offer

98
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,079
a correction point with the minimal

99
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,359
duration of time

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,959
this can also allow you to correct the

101
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,680
issue with minimal time stress on the

102
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,200
plants

103
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,439
and again the whole goal here is to

104
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,719
maximize your rooting

105
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,680
now there's also as i mentioned there's

106
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,439
automatic dosing solutions here where

107
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,040
for high end operations the ranges can

108
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,079
be set and monitor can be connected to

109
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,959
an automatic dose

110
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,000
injector where it can kind of work

111
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,360
automatically

112
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,039
where the environmental condition

113
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,720
becomes out of the acceptable range the

114
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,158
computer can automatically correct it

115
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,639
with little or no input

116
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,000
from the grower once the conditions are

117
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,598
set up by the grower

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,199
this is a hands-free approach and is

119
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,759
ideal for large-scale

120
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,280
operations now we're looking here at

121
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,518
some callus formation so the formation

122
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
of

123
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
callus can be an indication that

124
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,158
something is not quite right

125
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,598
an initial small callus may be followed

126
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,959
quickly by the root formation so don't

127
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,000
think immediately when you see callous

128
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,840
something's going wrong

129
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
but if you're getting an increase in the

130
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,759
size of the calc without roots

131
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
that can be an indication with large

132
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,399
catalyst grower needs to check the

133
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:02,798
environmental conditions the plants are

134
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,120
in

135
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,920
to hopefully ensure that the ph

136
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,158
nutrients

137
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,958
and temperature are all in the correct

138
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:10,239
ranges

139
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,319
and that provided you with just an

140
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,840
indication of the ranges that i use

141
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,599
lastly you want to be thinking about the

142
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,280
length that you have for you the stem

143
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,560
for rooting some growers cut them a

144
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,839
little too short try to get away with

145
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,839
too small of a cutting

146
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,758
so in this additional video i'm going to

147
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,000
walk you through a comparison

148
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
of different stem lengths to give you

149
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
the idea of what the proper stem length

150
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
should be

151
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:43,759
to ensure you have the best success with

152
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:45,918
your clones

153
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,160
so if we look at our cannabis clones

154
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,439
here we'll notice that this one

155
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,280
has a very turgid leaf very upright very

156
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,519
how it should how it should look

157
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,959
nice kind of turgid leaf right there

158
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,439
this one looks a little more flaccid a

159
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,758
little more

160
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,279
kind of wilty kind of look to it so

161
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
what's the possible reason for the

162
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,638
difference between these two

163
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,639
well if you look closely they were both

164
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,280
harvested at the same time

165
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,199
they're both in the same area so it

166
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,000
makes a little perplexing some growers

167
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,478
find

168
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,839
how can one can look so good and another

169
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,038
one can kind of look kind of

170
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,560
on that more wilty like look so let's

171
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:21,519
investigate this a little bit further if

172
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,360
we kind of zoom out

173
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,799
here just a little bit and we look at

174
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,000
the turgid leaf start

175
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,478
with this one first look at that clone a

176
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560
little water spraying

177
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,839
so if we look at this clone we can

178
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,360
notice the

179
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,679
amount of area that was left below

180
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,560
so if i kind of work this one out put

181
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,120
that there

182
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,959
go look at the area that was left below

183
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,079
we can see that there is definitely a

184
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,519
significant portion of rooting area on

185
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,240
there for this clone

186
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,959
look at the wilty one if we compare that

187
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,120
one

188
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,279
right next to it we can clearly see that

189
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,959
there is a difference between those two

190
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,059
so if we kind of go up and look a little

191
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,409
bit here

192
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,410
[Music]

193
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,079
so here we're looking at the difference

194
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,199
between these two the rooting area

195
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:14,000
on the more turjan one here

196
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,000
definitely much larger area here located

197
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,519
right below

198
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,279
compared to the one that is definitely

199
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,719
more flaccid and more wilty

200
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:25,359
we can clearly see that this one has a

201
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,880
much less area to root in and that's

202
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,319
what's causing the kind of

203
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,680
flaccid like look to the leaves here

204
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,600
compared to the one that's definitely

205
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,759
more turjan we can see it as leaves

206
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,759
able to support themselves horizontally

207
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,559
so we clearly see this plant has an

208
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,680
adequate area down here

209
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,478
for rooting this is why these leaves are

210
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,879
a lot more

211
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,000
turgid able to support itself still

212
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,839
hasn't rooted yet

213
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,839
but definitely looks much better overall

214
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:01,918
[Music]

215
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,240
in comparison when we look at this plant

216
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,918
we can see how much more flaccid it is

217
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,918
leaves much more droopy and that's

218
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,478
simply because the rooting area here is

219
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,639
much more

220
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,240
limiting so there's not much area to

221
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,800
absorb water

222
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,038
to maintain the hydration in this plant

223
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
now may root end up just fine

224
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,399
right now looking a little bit more

225
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
droopy than the one we saw

226
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,000
previously a lot more flaccid to this

227
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,319
one simply because of the limited

228
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,319
rooting area here an ability to absorb

229
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,839
water

230
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,478
