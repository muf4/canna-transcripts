00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,519
where we're looking at general cannabis

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,080
breeding overview

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,519
just kind of looking at a general

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,759
overview of something

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,679
that can be quite complex so hopefully

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,960
this will provide a little description

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,519
that i develop some basic understanding

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
so first off the basic review overview i

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,399
should say of heredity

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,839
other videos are provided on this

12
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,439
channel to better understand the basic

13
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,039
breeding process because i said it can

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,480
get quite confusing

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,160
we can look at punnett squares and

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,359
medium genetics we'll touch on that just

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,359
a little bit here

18
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,280
realize this is a very complex topic and

19
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,719
i just hope to give you a basic

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,558
overview here on this video so first off

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,039
we have to understand the basics of for

22
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:42,799
example

23
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,119
genes and there's dominant and there's

24
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,479
recessive genes so understanding

25
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,558
the difference between those two is

26
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,919
important individuals receive one

27
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,878
version of a gene called an

28
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,600
allele from each parent if the alleles

29
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,519
are different

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,640
the dominant allele will be expressed

31
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,320
while the

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,320
effect of the other allele called

33
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,119
recessive is masked

34
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,439
so a dominant gene will be expressed and

35
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,840
can

36
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,079
mask or override the effect of a

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,400
different variant of the same gene

38
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,599
on the other copy of the chromosome

39
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,159
recessive genes

40
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,719
an individual must inherit two copies of

41
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,118
the

42
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,840
mutated allele in order to express that

43
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,680
trait

44
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,000
now keep in mind this does not mean that

45
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,759
genes are bad or negative recessive

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,920
genes some some are but not necessarily

47
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,200
all of them sometimes recessive and

48
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
dominant

49
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
genes here have really no major effect

50
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,880
where we can see the example here of

51
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,879
having a

52
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,399
attached earlobe versus kind of a

53
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,000
distinctive earlobe here

54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,759
this is an example of recessive trait

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,438
and a dominant trait doesn't mean that

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,118
the recessive can hear any worse than

57
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,078
the dominant this is an example of a

58
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,399
phenotype

59
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,438
or what it would physically look like

60
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,118
compared to the

61
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,078
genotype the genetics here and we can

62
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,519
trace that through different lineages

63
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,599
now you get into things called sometimes

64
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,118
true breeding intrubing is a kind of

65
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,640
reading where the parents would produce

66
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,239
offspring that would carry the same

67
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,439
phenotype again phenotype is how the

68
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,718
organism looks

69
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,718
this means that the parents are

70
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,159
homozygous for every trait

71
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,598
this example we're reading purple with

72
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,719
purple getting purple reading purple

73
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,318
with purple getting purple

74
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,080
so on and so forth they're true breeding

75
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,318
they come true from type

76
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
we see the same thing here with the

77
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,759
white flowers as well

78
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,519
where we're noticing that the self

79
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,439
pollination we're getting more and more

80
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,920
of the same these would be examples of

81
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,120
true

82
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:30,479
breeding lines keep in mind

83
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,759
there's two sex chromosomes we identify

84
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,318
a female as having two x's and a male is

85
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,039
having an

86
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,719
x and a y this is how we get the female

87
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,239
flowers as we can see here

88
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,479
and then the male flowers you can see

89
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,200
closer to me here this is again boy and

90
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,840
girl

91
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,280
same example now the y is drawn smaller

92
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,719
at least in humans because the y

93
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,919
chromosome does contain

94
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,759
less genes than the larger x

95
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,119
now simplified punnett square this may

96
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,598
take you back to kind of

97
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,319
uh biology class where you're looking at

98
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,799
crossing

99
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,639
two genotypes together and this punnett

100
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,439
square is just a quick way to organize

101
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,799
things

102
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,878
it's a great way to kind of quickly go

103
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,560
through things where see the big g would

104
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,479
be dominant over the little g

105
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,000
we have a heterozygous this is called

106
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,359
where we have a dominant and recessive

107
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,959
allele with a dominant recessive allele

108
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
we breed them together

109
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
25 or one out of four would be the

110
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,800
homozygous

111
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,759
dominant fifty percent would be

112
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,280
heterozygous

113
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,359
we have one dominant and one recessive

114
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,000
allele and then 25 percent

115
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,319
would be homozygous recessive now

116
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,479
phenotypically or how they would look

117
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,719
75 percent of these would be green if

118
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,798
the capital g represents green color

119
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,479
and 25 percent be yellow because they

120
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,560
need to have both inherit

121
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,479
both of those genes there again just a

122
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,120
simplified quick run through of

123
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,399
punnett squares we you might hear things

124
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,599
called like the f1 and the f2 generation

125
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
because some traits may skip a

126
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,000
generation so here we have the parental

127
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,959
generation

128
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,400
the f1 and the f2 in this example the

129
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,519
parental generation we have a tall plant

130
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
and a short plant we can see their

131
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
genotype here

132
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,238
when these are bred together all the

133
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,598
resulting offspring are tall

134
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
but they're all heterozygous and they

135
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,079
all contain that mast

136
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,519
or that hidden recessive allele however

137
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,000
when we breed these together we see

138
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,680
those

139
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,519
short varieties come back again they

140
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,120
skipped that generation there

141
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,639
so it's important to keep that breeding

142
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,399
lineage going through

143
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,079
and we can see that here again with the

144
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,758
kind of cannabis strain two chemist

145
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
streams bringing those together

146
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
where we're tracking everything these

147
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,679
are female from these seeds make a back

148
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,519
cross

149
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
talk a second about back crossing but

150
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,359
keeping a

151
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,840
lineage and a kind of a family tree is

152
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,680
important for tracking traits

153
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,599
now that back crossing that i briefly

154
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,560
mentioned uh previously

155
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
back crossing is crossing of a hybrid

156
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,639
with one of its parents

157
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,519
or an individually genetically similar

158
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,160
to its parent

159
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,879
in order to achieve offspring with a

160
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
generic

161
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,240
identity which is closer to that of the

162
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,240
parent it's kind of like

163
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,079
going backwards literally within the

164
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,680
cross so here we have our parental

165
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,839
strain we have our f1 strain

166
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,439
well we have that back cross going back

167
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,719
through and reverting it to one of the

168
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,319
parental there

169
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,000
and that's helping limit the kind of

170
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,680
variability that you get

171
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,879
so here we have two parents this is kind

172
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,600
of a good way to kind of visually

173
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,680
consider it parents a and parents

174
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,840
are breed them together we get offspring

175
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,280
b we're going to breed offspring b with

176
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,000
that free current parent

177
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,399
parent r again b with r we get c and

178
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,079
then

179
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,519
c we breed that with r again and we're

180
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,079
kind of back crossing the sense we're

181
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,599
going

182
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,599
back to those genetics we're constantly

183
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,280
bringing those back into the line

184
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,680
to try to create some genetic

185
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,478
variability but also kind of keep an

186
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,879
idea of some of those traits recurring

187
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,038
back in the population

188
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,159
now gregor mendel was a monk that

189
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,719
studied

190
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,560
pea plants these are kind of an example

191
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,039
of kind of dihybrid crosses they're

192
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,120
called

193
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,639
so again this is a simplified example

194
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,240
the phenotypes are provided in this

195
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,639
simplified example it's kind of a great

196
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,600
visual that we can see tall plants and

197
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,759
green plants

198
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,360
looking here many traits do not follow

199
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,319
mendelian inherent so it's important to

200
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,759
keep that in mind

201
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,919
so this helps show the variability that

202
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,319
can occur from a basic cross involving

203
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,519
only two traits now when i say they

204
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,240
don't inherit

205
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,519
all mendelian so for example here we

206
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,759
either have green

207
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,000
or we have kind of that purple color

208
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,000
well there's a chance we could get

209
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,199
green with purple spots or purple with

210
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,918
green spots so

211
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
there is a lot of complexities and while

212
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,318
you look at this to go well this is

213
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,559
pretty complex

214
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,560
this is actually a simplified version of

215
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,519
having either a trait being expressed or

216
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,280
not expressed

217
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,038
following those mendelian inheritance

218
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,478
these are tall plants or they're short

219
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,038
plants they're either green

220
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,000
or they're purple so this is why keeping

221
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,159
a track record

222
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,600
of your breeding projects having a good

223
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,280
idea going in

224
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,879
and reviewing this video as well as

225
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,359
other videos that are on this channel as

226
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,839
well as

227
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,360
others can be important to know what

228
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,359
you're getting into so you have a good

229
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,840
understanding of the breeding process

230
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
so that you can be effective with the

231
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,038
time that you spend

232
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,638
and have an idea of what to look for

233
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,360
what to select against

234
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,918
to create a hopeful successful breeding

235
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,919
project
