1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
so for growers who are irrigating a lot

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,509
of times they want to add fertilizer and

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,239
an efficient way to do that is with a

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,650
fertilizer injector now there's three

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,750
different main types of options that I'm

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,120
going to include here to look at to make

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,339
this process nice and efficient easy

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,570
phloem as the injector and dosatron are

9
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,118
the three main types of fertilizer

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,550
injector options for those looking even

11
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,189
he and watering options to link it right

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,920
through the hose in piping that you're

13
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,810
already using so first off is the easy

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,809
flow this is a picture what it looks

15
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,729
like and hooks right up you can see

16
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:37,049
example here to the faucet and this is

17
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,029
what the internal structure looks like

18
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,679
it's a very easy attachment that comes

19
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,329
right with the unit what allows growers

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,700
to see the dilution of fertilizer during

21
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,469
the irrigation process however this can

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,239
reduce the flow because if you notice

23
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,640
you're kind of passing water through

24
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,439
here mixing it pressurizing the tank and

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,750
coming back out and adding it to the

26
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,789
hose in this case so the flow can be

27
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,789
reduced it also does not allow for

28
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,558
precise additions of the fertilizer so

29
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,870
that's gonna be another potential issue

30
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,179
see the water comes in here runs through

31
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,280
the easy flow and then comes out with a

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,799
dilution rate of the fertilizer and then

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,629
goes out to the irrigation water keep in

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,580
mind with this in all the systems you

35
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:15,329
should have some form of black flow

36
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,250
preventer

37
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,048
just to eliminate any chance of this

38
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,780
4-letter getting back and back feeding

39
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,380
it in this case the household system or

40
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,299
just the main water supply in general

41
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:28,798
bazi injector i'll work based on venturi

42
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,200
flow and suction there's no moving parts

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,299
which is great can be used in small and

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,890
large scale operations be sure to match

45
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,740
the flow rate to your irrigation system

46
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,569
now it does result about 20% drop in

47
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:41,728
pressure and flow so that can be a

48
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,078
negative if you're already kind of at

49
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,269
the limits of your system

50
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:46,978
this venturi system as you can see where

51
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,920
you're reduced to flow it picks up the

52
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,688
speed here operates like a carburetor on

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,149
system so it might be from about some

54
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:57,359
older cars you're kind of taking that

55
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,820
system of compressing here the total

56
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,349
area and increasing the speed as a

57
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,209
result the water would flow this way

58
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:04,949
because it's negative pressure this

59
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,530
little suction effect that would draw up

60
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,780
fertilizer and then on the outflow here

61
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,830
it'd be a water fertilizer mix the last

62
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,030
one here is called a dose

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,070
- Tron and I use that because it's kind

64
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,919
of a name-brand there's dosatron there's

65
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:22,289
mini dos there's kimi injectors many of

66
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,899
different types of these it was my age a

67
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:27,239
whole variety of names dosatron is a

68
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,950
name brand they are a water-powered

69
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,350
proportion er in the sense that as the

70
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,030
water flows by it is actively moving

71
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,739
pumping here these are the most

72
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,780
expensive of the options that I've

73
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,280
talked about and it has moving parts

74
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,590
which do need to be replaced because

75
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,729
they do wear over time however the

76
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,689
advantage of these is there's no

77
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:47,519
pressure or flow restrictions associated

78
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:50,669
with these type of the injectors you can

79
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,230
also install a bypass here also if we're

80
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,149
not injecting and just run clean water

81
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,769
right through it does allow for very

82
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,319
accurate dosing which is why they are

83
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,600
advised to be used simply because you

84
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,400
can really dial in the exact amount of

85
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,199
fertilizer you want to add to your

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,120
irrigation water so that's their

87
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,549
advantage either down fellows they are

88
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,890
more expensive option we do have some

89
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,530
moving parts so as growers you get away

90
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:15,539
all the potential options available to

91
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,560
you pick the one that's the best fit for

92
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,560
your given conditions
