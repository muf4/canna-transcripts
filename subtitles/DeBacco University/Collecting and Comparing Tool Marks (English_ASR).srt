1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
okay here we'll be looking at collecting

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,318
and comparing tool marks

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,960
which often are very important pieces of

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,519
evidence

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,839
in a crime scene so first off a tool

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,839
mark it's defined as any impression cut

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,759
gouge or abrasion caused by a tool

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,600
coming in contact with another object

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,800
and they are typically found in forced

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,240
entry

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,359
scenarios we see here in a door kind of

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,598
prying it open

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,039
you see the tool marks definitely left

14
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,118
here to help

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,800
open that door when it was probably in

16
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,399
the locked position

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,439
now when you compare tool marks again

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,039
there's a lot of different types of

19
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,199
tools but tool mark impressions can

20
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,039
reveal class characteristics or

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,800
or the size and shape of the tool

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,558
because for example a crowbar is going

23
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,959
to leave a much larger impression than a

24
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,280
small

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,359
screwdriver typically we're unable to

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
connect the marks to one specific tool

27
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,479
unless there's a random nick or break

28
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,839
that tool has acquired

29
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,519
giving it individual characteristics

30
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,039
if we look here at a pair of bolt

31
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,680
cutters that were used to cut a left

32
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,000
shackle

33
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,679
the comparison micro photograph shows

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,399
evidence of the lock shackle on the left

35
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,079
side

36
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,079
and the test cup produced by the bolt

37
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,400
cutters and a piece of lead on the right

38
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,679
you can see that there's definitely a

39
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,118
pretty close match

40
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,760
on many of those ridges and valleys

41
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,159
there

42
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
we're looking at unique wear patterns

43
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,400
the edges of a tool display

44
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,320
microscopic irregularities that look

45
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,439
like ridges and valleys as a result of

46
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,239
the manufacturing

47
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,279
process it's just a normal kind of end

48
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,839
product

49
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,118
damage and wear of the tool when used

50
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,000
creates a variety of unique

51
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,040
patterns which again can help with the

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,599
identification identification or

53
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,680
matching

54
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,319
process these imperfections can be used

55
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
to identify individual tools you can see

56
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,199
here

57
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,359
a knife edge of a suspect's knife when

58
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,840
compared or matched to a piece of a

59
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,078
rib cage from a victim and we're

60
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,520
noticing these origin valleys have a lot

61
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,559
of similar characteristics

62
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,798
and almost directly match up so again

63
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,159
this can be used to help tie in a

64
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,880
particular knife

65
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,159
to a crime scene not just a knife to a

66
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,000
crime scene

67
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,520
then when we're doing these comparisons

68
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,040
it's important that when a tool is

69
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,758
scraped against a softer

70
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
surface it may cut a series of striated

71
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,359
lines that reflect the pattern of the

72
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,479
tool's edge as we can see here

73
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,640
income and compared using a comparison

74
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,000
microscope with test tool marks made by

75
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,479
the suspect's weapon

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,759
to see if there are in fact uh ridges

77
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,919
and valleys that can be

78
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,439
matched up and in the image we see here

79
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,919
where the line splits the left to the

80
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,959
right

81
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,679
you can see a lot of consistencies there

82
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,640
in that comparison now problems with

83
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
tool mark

84
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,919
comparisons or that they can be

85
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
difficult to duplicate

86
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,439
the tool mark left at the crime scene in

87
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,840
the laboratory

88
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,878
must make test marks of various angles

89
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
and different pressures

90
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,639
to see if a match can be made there's

91
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,479
also a lot of different kind of

92
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,839
cut mark shapes there's y cuts and t

93
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,039
cuts and v shapes

94
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,959
and a lot of this comes down to the

95
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,639
pressure or the angle

96
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,080
and it can be hard to recreate that

97
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,399
because all those exact kind of

98
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,280
factors in a lab and this is why

99
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,439
typically multiple lab

100
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,959
laceration marks need to be made

101
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,598
multiple impressions need to be made in

102
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,598
the lab

103
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,919
to be able to compare it to what was

104
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,679
found at the crime scene

105
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,000
now it's collecting of tool mark

106
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,360
evidence the entire object or part of

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
the object bearing the tool mark should

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
be submitted to the laboratory for

109
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,598
evidence

110
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,280
when the tool mark cannot be uh from the

111
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:25,759
cry it can not be removed from the crime

112
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,199
scene

113
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,518
other options such as taking a picture

114
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,119
or making a cast should be implemented

115
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,360
liquid silicone the best material to use

116
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,878
for casting and a lot of detail can be

117
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,879
lost when you're forced to use

118
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,079
a photograph and a cast so it's best at

119
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,120
the actual image

120
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,000
but something is better than nothing

121
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,360
so lastly when we have that piece of

122
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,959
evidence that is found

123
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,799
we want to be sure that we're handling

124
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,640
it with care never attempt to fit a

125
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,400
suspect's tool into the tool mark

126
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,318
as it could alter the mark and question

127
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,239
the integrity of the evidence

128
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,919
the suspect tool and mark are packaged

129
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,120
in separate containers to keep from

130
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,238
destroying their individual

131
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,000
characteristics

132
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,438
this can be trace evidence like paint

133
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,598
chips on the tool or

134
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,359
impressions must be careful when

135
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,359
handling packaging evidence so you don't

136
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
lose any potential trace evidence and we

137
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,640
can see here

138
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,438
of a nice little storage area for a

139
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,719
knife

140
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,319
that may have some blood evidence that's

141
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,120
why it has the biohazard symbol but this

142
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,918
is going to help

143
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,120
maintain all those potential individual

144
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,279
characteristics

145
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,040
without causing any alterations so it

146
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,000
can be entered as evidence

147
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,000
in a crime scene
