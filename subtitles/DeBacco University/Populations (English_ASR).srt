1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
here we're gonna look at populations in

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:07,648
general and the title slide here we have

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,900
the world population percentages you can

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,559
see that China has the largest

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,269
percentage here based on 2017 statistics

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:17,368
eighteen and a half percent of the

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,778
world's population India's not far

8
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:20,939
behind it seventeen point nine percent

9
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:22,800
the United States at four point three

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,439
Indonesia three and a half and

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,260
continuing down from there and smaller

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,929
ones here the others that are not listed

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,070
just kind of lumped into this category

14
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:34,710
represent almost thirty percent of the

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,869
world's population so population summary

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,520
slide so this is dis included here is

17
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:39,718
kind of a way to review at the end to

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,239
make sure you've touched on all these

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,670
points and you understand population

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,909
size population density population

21
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,739
dispersion and population growth this

22
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,538
video lecture will address many of these

23
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,788
use also a couple other be Elektra self

24
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,480
tidies in to allow you to make

25
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,640
worthwhile connections so population

26
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,729
range will in general it's a geographic

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,439
area within which that species can be

28
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,688
found with localized dispersion

29
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,969
densities so we lose the example here of

30
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,349
fire ants and they were accidentally

31
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,228
introduced to the United States in the

32
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:16,408
1930s and they were actually snowed on

33
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:19,679
Chappell ballasts that were landed in

34
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,509
Port of Mobile Alabama here so put star

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,340
right here removal Alabama was located

36
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,200
might be familiar with where it's

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,009
located sadly during hurricane season

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,450
this is a very common area they're

39
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:32,640
currently infest about two hundred and

40
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,579
fifteen million acres United States this

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,489
is firing yes because they're adapting

42
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,449
to drier conditions in western areas and

43
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:41,609
infestans

44
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,629
greater regional areas so their

45
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:47,359
population range is increasing

46
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:49,408
contribute to the spread of finances

47
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,209
mating flights within the wind

48
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,530
there's also flooding regions pushing

49
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,250
them in different areas they're

50
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,820
hitchhiking hitchhiking down vehicles

51
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,500
agricultural commodities and

52
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,989
horticultural commodities are helping

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,540
ships them sadly throughout larger

54
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:06,179
regions of the world these are areas in

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,719
red words certain green represents very

56
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:14,099
possible conditions and then and the

57
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:16,199
blue regions are less likely but still

58
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,609
of all areas we could see the definite

59
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,689
like the warmer environments but they

60
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,210
are expanding another organism Sally

61
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,859
that's expanding is zebra mussels the

62
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,990
native distribution of these species is

63
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:34,050
in the Black Sea in cats Caspian Sea in

64
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,300
Eurasia and zebra mussels have become

65
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,939
invasive species in North America Great

66
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,820
Britain Ireland Italy Spain and Sweden

67
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,139
so over a very large area so today it

68
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,509
looks like on a close-up

69
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,279
but sadly one is not too bad but we

70
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:50,159
could see that there very rarely we'll

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,169
just find one they in really colonize an

72
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,659
area as a result it can disrupt

73
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,359
ecosystems by basically kind of like a

74
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,579
mono typical single species here

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,620
colonization making damaged harbours

76
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,870
waterways ships boats water treatment

77
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,030
and power plants see here how they just

78
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,700
kind of in crushed this kind of Budo

79
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,740
sitting in the water

80
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:12,539
zebra mussels of water treatment plants

81
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,640
are most impacted because water intakes

82
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:17,310
bring in microscopic reefs women lara

83
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,459
durbur cleans the facilities zebra

84
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,439
mussels can clog pipes and because of

85
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,260
their massive birthrate and just kind of

86
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,240
most multiply so densely that water

87
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,310
can't pass through this image here shows

88
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,590
a shopping cart that was left in zebra

89
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,810
mussel infected waters for a few months

90
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,340
and the mussels have colonized every

91
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,229
available surface on the cart

92
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,150
here they are colonizing other shells

93
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,599
and just see how they simply just take

94
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,099
over addition to that is zebra mussel

95
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,680
range they're still spreading at an

96
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,180
alarming rate so we see here 1988 and

97
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,830
expanding from there

98
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,980
this is sponsored by the USGS you see I

99
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,219
take over river systems how their

100
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:01,709
experience leader is here so far the

101
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:06,620
West Coast is pretty free down the

102
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:09,719
Mississippi River here and slowly

103
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,120
expanding further and further west and

104
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,129
then sadly while they're really dense

105
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,489
here they do start to pop up on the west

106
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:19,290
coast even in points in between and they

107
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,739
are still spreading at an alarming rate

108
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:25,050
so an area of concern here so much of

109
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,519
the concern a local problem here in

110
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,819
Connecticut will be areas where they

111
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,039
indicate high risk

112
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:33,879
lakes and water systems medium risk in

113
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,010
low risk areas there's a list of areas

114
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,939
where they're currently known to be as a

115
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:43,180
result they'll hang signs up to help

116
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:45,610
educate voters and people in general so

117
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,069
they're not transporting please they can

118
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,949
be transported in water that's taken

119
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:53,860
from an area may be transported in live

120
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,089
wells of votes bunks of trailers this is

121
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,400
all things that people need to be

122
00:04:55,089 --> 00:05:00,329
mindful that they're disposing all

123
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:03,159
foreign that are far away from the water

124
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:04,859
population expansions pyramiding of

125
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,210
numbers of a biological population

126
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,129
population growth in more and less

127
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:11,469
developed countries based in 2002

128
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:13,829
information less developed countries are

129
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,080
having a much larger population

130
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:19,209
expansion than more developed countries

131
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:21,039
so we're looking at this is kind of

132
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:22,689
what's already been done we're looking

133
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,540
at predictions going into the future we

134
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:28,810
see this trend continuing based on the

135
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,490
population pyramids population

136
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,069
contraction it's a reduction over time

137
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:36,300
our region's population the decline can

138
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:39,099
be caused by several factors including

139
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,020
basically under power fertility along

140
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,850
with limited immigration heavy

141
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,589
emigration it's anything a country they

142
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,860
could be a disease that comes in famine

143
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:50,619
or war in the case of the cod we see

144
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,040
that there was in the 60s kind of mid

145
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,139
60s 70s explosion in the population but

146
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,890
then sadly in 1992 the population

147
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:02,229
completely crashed is is true in east

148
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:05,649
coast of Newfoundland it's also

149
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,640
occurring sadly in other areas Cape Cod

150
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:08,919
in Massachusetts

151
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,469
something's been called Cape no Cod

152
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,660
because of the missing of the cod

153
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,030
population there it's a result of

154
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,950
population contraction in the region's

155
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:21,179
population is on the decline which can

156
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:21,180
be for a number of reasons
