1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,679
then we're looking at growing the actual

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,620
cannabis and getting to the final end

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:10,289
result that flower or those cannabinoids

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,269
can end up in many different end or

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,750
final products so I want to go over just

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,490
what a couple of those are first off is

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,698
the obvious wonder that's the flower net

8
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:23,549
allows offer actual inspection of the

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,470
final product however can have great

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,150
variability even if to dispensary is

11
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:29,339
carrying the same name you have

12
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:32,339
different effects typically the flower

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,109
requires joints to be used which require

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,250
rolling and some people enjoy or

15
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:38,070
pre-rolls

16
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,920
as they take the work out of smoking so

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,070
in both these cases the flower is the

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,320
actual plant produced product in its raw

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,270
form then we get to something called

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,609
hash which is a resin which is consumed

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,440
by smoking a small apparatus kind of

22
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:55,350
refining and getting away from the

23
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,420
actual flower or end product of the

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,399
actual plant and transforming it into a

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,289
different form

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,820
then there's edibles which there's no

27
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,829
need to smoke the product so it's

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,989
commonly infusing gummies or candies or

29
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,118
other treats there was an area of

30
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,280
concern with edibles since I am the

31
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,659
pictures here is that minors can get a

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,750
hold of them since they look like normal

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,520
products and others are concerns with

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,769
these are people over consuming without

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,840
realizing since there's a delayed effect

36
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,329
sometimes 30 Delta up to 60 minutes

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,609
after consumption so they could consume

38
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,950
in this case on one piece of cake or one

39
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:29,938
brownie and then wait 15 minutes and say

40
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,769
well nothing happened let me have

41
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,769
another one and not really if there's a

42
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:38,158
delayed effect in their effects after

43
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,798
the consumption particularly for THC for

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
CBD want to be careful and avoid

45
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,229
overdosing that's what I want to be very

46
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,609
careful and treat this as medicine

47
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:49,500
there's topicals which are lotions and

48
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:53,118
balms which are typically used for

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,450
localized pain for a very specific area

50
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:59,250
and make for a very easy application

51
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,259
there's concentrates or oils which is a

52
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,228
broad category that includes butts not

53
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,530
women - such as wax shatters butters or

54
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:10,228
hashes what this allows is the chemical

55
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,989
compounds of the flower to be literally

56
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,920
concentrated and made more consistently

57
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:18,000
to a

58
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:20,009
for more specific dosing we have the

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,199
vape pens which offer quick and easy

60
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:24,949
usage the main issue those increased use

61
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:28,679
of liners using due to the ease of

62
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:29,879
concealing the very small easy and -

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,219
you're getting the hold these at very

64
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,490
young ages and that's causing a major

65
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,490
issue
