00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,689
the sediment filter and details

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:14,879
surrounding that will be covered

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,560
let's go over using a sediment filter

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,640
for cannabis production

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,160
so first off what is a sediment filter

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,080
let's start with the basics

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,278
the sediment filter captures and removes

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,919
a particulate matter

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,000
such as soil and debris from the water

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,840
this can apply to both municipal as well

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
as natural water sources

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,079
flakes of rust can enter your water

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,120
supply from corroded galvanized plumbing

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,799
rainwater can carry silt clay soil and

17
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,359
grains of sand

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,159
into your well groundwater supply so

19
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,159
it's important

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,359
if you have any of these to be utilizing

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,759
a sediment filter

22
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,000
so you can take out that particulate so

23
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,399
you can be left with

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
clean water at least that looks clean

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,600
sediment filters keep in mind do not

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,480
remove any contaminants

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,840
only the physical sized particles so

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,919
what's the advantage of

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,760
a sediment filter well sediment filter

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,159
is the first line of defense against

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,799
dirt and debris in your irrigation

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,600
system

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
this prohibits all of the solid

34
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,319
particulate

35
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,000
from entering your water supply and

36
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,599
impeding the performance of your water

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,920
filtration systems

38
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,959
such as carrying of irrigation pipes

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,359
could be wearing out

40
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,719
pumps doing damage to any sort of

41
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,879
filters or o-rings

42
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,000
down the line send filter is a great

43
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,560
guard against

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
any of that from happening so how do

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,640
sediment filters work will sediment

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,118
filters

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,320
physically block unwanted particulate

48
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,200
matter based on

49
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,959
its size 7 filters are like a net that

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,920
catches the particulate matter traveling

51
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,599
in the water

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,879
so here we see an example here we have

53
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,478
our larger particles our smaller

54
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,158
particles able to pass through

55
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,840
seven filters going to take out those

56
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,920
larger clay

57
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,118
sand particles in comparison to

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
something really fine

59
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,799
like ions it kind of might look like

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,359
this in the end where it looks like it's

61
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,840
still encased with a soil

62
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,599
some are more of a paper component some

63
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,520
more of a mesh screen

64
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,798
all of them basically work the same way

65
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,758
of filtering out

66
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,239
those larger particulate sizes so what

67
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,439
do

68
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,280
some filters remove well the

69
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,479
sediment filters can remove visible

70
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
particles matter

71
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,679
in any particles of dirt sand dust and

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,239
debris

73
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,120
they can be caught by its micron rated

74
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,800
capacity

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,480
so cinnamon filters also remove

76
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
turbidity from the water as we can see

77
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,639
here

78
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,399
so we said what does sediment filters

79
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,439
remove well it depends on

80
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,200
what size the sediment filter you have

81
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,878
the smaller the size

82
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,878
the greater amount that will remove

83
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,679
however typically also the slower the

84
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,079
flow rate

85
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
so this is why there are different sizes

86
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
because it may affect the flow rate or

87
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,359
the gallons per minute you're getting

88
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,439
through that filter

89
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,280
what are the limitations of a sediment

90
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,680
filter because every filter again

91
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,280
is has some limitations and seven

92
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,640
filters do not remove chemicals heavy

93
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,840
metals bacterias or dissolved

94
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,679
particulate matter

95
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,360
they do not improve the taste or smell

96
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,040
of the water so just be aware

97
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,800
if that's you're looking to remove

98
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,919
sediment filter is not going to be a

99
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
good option for you

100
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,119
it may produce water it looks clear and

101
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,319
that can be a good thing

102
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,158
but doesn't necessarily remove the

103
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,199
chemicals bacteria or

104
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,519
heavy metals from that water however

105
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,759
semi-fillers are still very common seven

106
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,120
filters are the most effective when

107
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,039
serving as pre-filters for other

108
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,560
filtration systems they're typically

109
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,878
used in conjunction with other

110
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,878
filtration methods like reverse osmosis

111
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,318
or carbon filtration as well they're

112
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,598
typically the first line of defense to

113
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,518
make these filters last

114
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,119
longer as well to take out anything that

115
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,200
might be in the irrigation water

116
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,959
initially so what are the different

117
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,798
types of sediment filters as we get into

118
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,158
some more of the details

119
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,920
there's a couple listed here our pleated

120
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,919
filters are best suited for large

121
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,039
particulate are also washable and

122
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,318
reusable

123
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,318
then we have meltdown melt-blown filters

124
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,438
and these are best suited for fine

125
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,199
particulates

126
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,318
so it's kind of that different particle

127
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,039
size you want to know what's in your

128
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,119
water

129
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,719
then here right below me we have this

130
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,878
string wound filters

131
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,158
and once overloaded with sediment they

132
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,239
will pass them through

133
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,199
indicating the need for filter change

134
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,878
but this could cause

135
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,238
issues down the line so keep that in

136
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,719
mind that this

137
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,840
melt blown filter great for fine

138
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,680
particulate

139
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,120
string works great and then all of a

140
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,639
sudden once it fills it'll let those

141
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
particular goes by and that can cause

142
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,600
some severe issues

143
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,879
down the line then we also have

144
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
something called bag filters which

145
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,159
change

146
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,520
in micron size between 1 and 200 microns

147
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
and then we have a spun down filter

148
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,639
designed to remove

149
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,159
large size debris from the water as well

150
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
so again depending on what you're trying

151
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,639
to remove

152
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,478
will determine what type of sediment

153
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
filter might be the best option for you

154
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,159
to select

155
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,279
so let's just talk about micron size

156
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,199
well sediments

157
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,039
filters micron rating indicates what

158
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,079
size particles the filter will be able

159
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,960
to eliminate

160
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,918
for example a 10 micron filter we will

161
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,959
remove anything

162
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,560
10 microns and larger the micron size of

163
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,120
your sediment filter will vary based

164
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,040
upon

165
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
the respective size of the sediment you

166
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,520
are seeking to eliminate from your

167
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
source

168
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,079
for a reverse osmosis or ro system a 5

169
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
micron sediment pre-filter is typically

170
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,639
recommended

171
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,959
this just kind of shows that relative

172
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,160
comparison of microns compared to the

173
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,198
average human hair

174
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,840
being about 150 and working way down

175
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,720
here just again give you just a general

176
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,119
idea of

177
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,840
silver mesh size inches in the microns

178
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,399
and the typical material that might be

179
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,719
removing

180
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,439
so nominal versus absolute filter or

181
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,240
ratings

182
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,240
kind of something that often is used as

183
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,199
interchangeable terms when clearly it is

184
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,840
not

185
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,439
nominal mean or average 5 micron rating

186
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,119
means that the filter is designed to

187
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,319
capture approximately

188
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,280
everything 5 microns and above

189
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,360
an absolute 5 micron rating means that

190
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,559
the filter remove

191
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,439
over 95 percent of anything 5 microns in

192
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,280
size

193
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,038
so keep that in mind that the nominal

194
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,679
versus absolute is also probably going

195
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,680
to have

196
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,840
a significant price difference an

197
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,918
absolute rated micron filter can ensure

198
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,959
specific contaminant is removed from the

199
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,038
water source

200
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,799
as a result that's probably going to

201
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,159
probably gonna pay a little bit more for

202
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,280
that type of precision

203
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,039
in your filtering method then the

204
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,559
frequency of filter changes and once i

205
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,079
know well how often do i need to change

206
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,639
that filter

207
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,359
and it really depends on many factors

208
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,360
one

209
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
reliable method is to watch for a water

210
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
pressure drop

211
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,600
so a lot of times you have your water

212
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,318
filter and you'll have a little pressure

213
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,240
gauge before

214
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
and after it you want to make sure those

215
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
gauges are reading the same if one

216
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,879
starts reading a little bit lower

217
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,879
it's a sign it might be time to change

218
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,639
that filter simply because

219
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,159
a filter clogged which is filled with

220
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,240
sediment will cause a reduced

221
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,680
reduced water pressure so that can be a

222
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,038
great easy way to indicate

223
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,639
that filter pri is going to need to be

224
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,240
changed however the general

225
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,079
recommendation is to change the filter

226
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,918
or at least check it every 6 to 12

227
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,318
months depending on the flow rate and

228
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,318
rating and also the type of water you

229
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,479
have coming into that filter system

230
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
once you have an idea you can have make

231
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,439
note of it write it down

232
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,198
and you can have an idea of how

233
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,199
frequency will change your filter

234
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,478
but that pressure drop is a great way to

235
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,160
know exactly when

236
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,000
it's time to check that filter and most

237
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,160
likely time to change that filter so

238
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,160
make sure you have an extra on hand
