00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
okay here i'm going to describe why if

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,918
you're going snorkeling it's easier to

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,679
hold your breath

4
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,589
after you inhale a bunch of air than

5
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:12,660
after you exhale here at tobacco

00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:12,660

university

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,559
now why is it easier to hold your breath

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,760
after your inhalation than after

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,759
exhalation

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,760
well this actually is because your body

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,400
cannot detect low oxygen levels

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,960
could only sense high carbon dioxide

14
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,719
levels

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,880
your brain actually uses blood carbon

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,600
dioxide levels as an indicator

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,520
for blood oxygen models so when carbon

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,679
dioxide levels are too high

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,640
you're signaled to take a breath at that

20
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,479
point

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,759
now as you can see here in the whales

22
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,599
they're taking a breath before they're

23
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,479
descending they're filling their

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,079
lungs full of oxygen and this is why the

25
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:59,839
suit allows them disease to emerge

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:59,840
for long periods of time

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:08,560
you
