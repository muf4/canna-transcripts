1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,448
if you've been looking for seeds this

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,189
might be a term you've heard before

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:06,660
called feminized see you might be

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,669
wondering what what is that

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,888
well feminized seeds referring to

6
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:13,259
cannabis seed in particular because it's

7
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,088
producing male and female plants the

8
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,820
niceties refer to the production of

9
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,519
seeds that will only produce female

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,570
plants which is advantageous for those

11
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,698
are the ones that are going to produce

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,929
the buds and the cannabinoids that we

13
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,250
are looking for so the advantage is that

14
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:32,519
producing only female offspring instead

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,380
of the 50/50 odds of male to female so

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,690
instead of kind of having half the seeds

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,730
be male and half the seeds be female the

18
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,820
feminized state advantage is sliding the

19
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,949
odds in much favor of producing only

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,329
female offsprings this is advantageous

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,920
because it eliminates the need to

22
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,289
produce and care for plants that may not

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,760
yield any buds or product the male

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,469
plants will just produce pollen which

25
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,420
really isn't of any value unless you're

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,160
a breeder here we're looking at trying

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,899
to produce the female plants that are

28
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,328
the ones that are producing the buds in

29
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,370
the highest cannabinoids now the

30
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,618
production of this a known female plant

31
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:07,649
is made to produce male pollen sacks to

32
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,959
apply the silver thiosulfate STS it's is

33
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,510
its abbreviation this pollen can be used

34
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,149
to fertilize other female plants and if

35
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,719
you look over here keeping in mind that

36
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,299
females have two X chromosomes and males

37
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,099
have an X and a Y chromosome so because

38
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,650
we're inducing male pollen sex from a

39
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,539
female plant this pollen originally came

40
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,329
from a female so the chromosomes will be

41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,850
xx resulting in near 100% of female

42
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:37,199
seeds produced instead of the regular

43
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:38,578
50/50 male to female odds there again

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,439
the same aniseed advantage is by

45
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,239
ensuring female plants from seed allows

46
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,938
the lack of lost time growing a plant

47
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,039
that will not produce a valuable product

48
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,529
and again that valuable product would be

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,880
the buds instead of the pollen now if

50
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,549
you're a breeder you're looking for

51
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,530
pollen not the best option for you but

52
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,290
for most people feminized seed is an

53
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,759
advantage for if the disadvantage is

54
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,740
that there's increased cost in most

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,359
cases for the seeds in the production of

56
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,359
feminized seeds limits the genetic pool

57
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,950
so this creates an easy plant in grow

58
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,840
situation but does not allow for

59
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,939
refinement or selection you're kind of

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,560
locked into that set of genetics some

61
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,199
fields are natural play

62
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,348
state changes the chemical profiles by

63
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,149
inducing that female production lastly

64
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:23,729
we have some research going on at UConn

65
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,289
with Jess Jessica Lubell is it you can't

66
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,699
plant science professors looking at me

67
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:29,039
finding the feminized seed production

68
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:31,549
technique recently published article

69
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,469
which I link right down here for you

70
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,540
entitled favoring female flowers in hand

71
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:39,330
horticulture so something to check out

72
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:42,709
in refining this technique of the

73
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,709
production of them and I seed
