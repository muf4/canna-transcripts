1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,480
this debaco university video is going to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
look at some of the beneficial insects

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,800
that you would like to find on your

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,240
cannabis plants it will also end with

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,000
a picture of a nice lady beetle nymph

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,440
crawling around on a cannabis plant

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,118
helping control some

8
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,118
aphids on that plant

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:27,198
[Music]

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,278
all right let's get into beneficial

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,240
insects for cannabis plants ones that we

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,119
would want to see

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,960
and identify so first off what's this

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,159
kind of video lecture going to cover

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,320
well these are going to be the ones

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,519
we're going to go through and cover

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,799
so if there's anyone in particular

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,360
interest you can go through and jump to

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,119
that one

20
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,719
or at least you know the ones that will

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,320
be covered and again these are the ones

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,280
we want to find or encourage

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,799
to live in and around our plants so the

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,679
first one

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,919
is seyfried flies or called hoverflies a

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,920
lot of times or flower flies sometimes

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,399
most beneficial for targeting mostly

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,440
slow moving soft bodies insects such as

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,840
mealy bugs

30
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,798
and especially aphids they can also

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
attack scale

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,880
and some species of thrips so this just

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,479
kind of shows you some of these hover

34
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,199
flies what they look like or flower

35
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,519
flies in the adult stage the larva stage

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,478
and then here is one actively feeding on

37
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,560
a colony of

38
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,920
aphids so again it's just going to give

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,320
you this brief overview

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,560
of find this insect what it might go

41
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,839
through and be best utilized

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,079
for controlling then we have a green

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
lace wings here and these adults feed on

44
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,519
nectar pollen and honeydew

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,118
while the larvae are active predators of

46
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,239
soft-bodied insect pests so it's the

47
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:37,359
larvae the ones that are really doing

48
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,039
most of the feeding

49
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,799
this is an example of one of the larvae

50
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,159
right here a little scary

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,000
what does it feed on what feeds mostly

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,280
on aphids thrips white flies leaf

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,840
hoppers spider mites

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,439
especially red mites and also mealybugs

55
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,640
so it sounds like a pretty great list

56
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,639
here of

57
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,680
insects that these feed on want to

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
purchase larvae

59
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,840
as this is the most advantageous for

60
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,680
immediate treatment of a pest problem

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,118
if you are purchasing the adults we see

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,920
right here and here for size

63
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,959
orientation you are seeking to establish

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,879
a population

65
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,159
still larvae that do the main feeding on

66
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,159
those pest insects

67
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,840
the adults you're looking establishing a

68
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,840
population in your area

69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
which would not be a bad thing you can

70
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,120
also purchase eggs that will soon hatch

71
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,800
into larvae and kind of start the cycle

72
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,959
as well

73
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,920
then we have the collapse beetle here

74
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,120
so here they are important predators for

75
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,598
soft bodied insects

76
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,239
white flies of all stages of white flies

77
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,359
um

78
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,840
small lingus nymphs aphids mites uh

79
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
the zepturin eggs as well as a

80
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,400
caterpillars

81
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,759
these can be important for the natural

82
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,519
control of white flies and field

83
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,799
applications along with selective

84
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,239
insecticides

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,160
so again if you're having that kind of

86
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,800
white fly issue this might be

87
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:52,959
one worth considering then we also have

88
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
next up we have the damsel bug they're

89
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,039
predators of aphids

90
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,440
moths eggs and small caterpillars this

91
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,759
also

92
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,199
includes corn earworms as well as

93
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,598
european corn borer

94
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,318
imported cabbage worm and some army

95
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,560
worms

96
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,399
very important pests particularly for

97
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,400
those outdoor growers

98
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,560
other prey may include leaf hoppers

99
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,280
small sawflies larvae mites tarnish

100
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,120
plant bugs

101
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,199
nymphs asparagus beetles colored potato

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,878
beetle eggs and nymphs as well

103
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,560
we can see these damsel bugs in the

104
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,399
adult and dimp stage

105
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,560
and how they look at the different

106
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,158
stages here this they call the nymph

107
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
stage this kind of ice cream cone shaped

108
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,840
body

109
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,318
and here we have the adult pictured

110
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
there

111
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,839
again good insects to be on the lookout

112
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,559
for

113
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
then spied assassin bugs they're

114
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,239
different

115
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,719
uh species of assassin bugs so it's not

116
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,000
just a one size fits all necessarily

117
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,158
but one of the these are one of the

118
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,959
largest at least in size of the insect

119
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,120
predators

120
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,759
they typically feed on versus

121
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,519
caterpillars such as corn ear worms

122
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,318
zebra caterpillars and yellow striped

123
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,239
army worms here's an example of an adult

124
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,119
assassin bug we can see some others as

125
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,959
well

126
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
as also in the larval stages in the egg

127
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,878
stage again these assassin bugs do just

128
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,159
as the name implies they go through and

129
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,000
they try to assassinate

130
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,759
other hopefully negative bugs that are

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,360
in your area and these

132
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,318
will be the beneficial ones then we have

133
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,319
the the

134
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,319
pirate bugs here so these are really

135
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,238
small so again as a comparison

136
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,680
most these bugs are small the assassins

137
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,679
are on the larger side

138
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,199
try to see the size orientation here

139
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,560
these are one of the most common general

140
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,079
predators in field crops

141
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,680
but can also be used for indoor growing

142
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,680
environments as well

143
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,160
merging early in the spring their diet

144
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
consists of a variety of small pests

145
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,240
which include thrips whitefly nymphs and

146
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
aphids as seen in the images here white

147
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,120
flies here

148
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,720
and here's some aphids they reproduce

149
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
quickly and complete their total life

150
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
cycle in just three to four weeks

151
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,360
making them effective at handling

152
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,040
serious infestations relatively quickly

153
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
and again they are small as size

154
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,319
comparison here the aphids

155
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,400
and they are larger but they're not that

156
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,879
much larger so be aware of the size of

157
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,239
these

158
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,879
when you're trying to go through and

159
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,840
identify if you have them or not

160
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,000
lastly up here we have the lady beetles

161
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,599
or also known as just simply ladybugs

162
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,360
there are different species of lady

163
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,320
beetles we can see here so i try to give

164
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
you a list a little

165
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,560
variety there are natural enemies of

166
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,120
many insects in particular aphids and

167
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,280
other sap

168
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,038
feeding insects some species prefer

169
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,119
might or scale populations

170
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,639
so if using them as a biological control

171
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,399
check to make sure you're maximizing the

172
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,000
effectiveness for your situation

173
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,319
what insect are you trying to get them

174
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,680
to control now as mentioned

175
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,599
this is ladybugs they're kind of

176
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
nymph stage looks very different than

177
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
their adult stage

178
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,280
this is a beneficial insect this is the

179
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
time when they do consume

180
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,119
kind of they get into that life cycle of

181
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,560
consuming aphids so if you have aphids

182
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,199
around having these around

183
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,959
is a good thing i've included a short

184
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,879
video where i did find them feeding on

185
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,399
some aphids on a cannabis plant

186
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:57,199
that i welcome you to watch and enjoy

187
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,318
now not all bugs are bad here we're

188
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,080
looking

189
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,360
at right here a ladybug

190
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,000
out of nymph or larval stage this is

191
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,840
important

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,279
when we're looking at having beneficial

193
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,599
insects and they are

194
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,159
great at controlling aphids and sadly

195
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,120
this plant does have some aphids on it

196
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,840
so having some beneficial insects such

197
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,800
as

198
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,638
showing that we're having that

199
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,639
progression that completed life cycle

200
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,519
will help naturally reduce the pest

201
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,400
population

202
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,959
without doing any damage to the crop

203
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,959
here

204
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,279
you know however in order for them to be

205
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,399
effective they must be applied early in

206
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,799
large numbers

207
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,839
and here we're in a large greenhouse so

208
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,360
it is definitely

209
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,439
beneficial in keeping them kind of

210
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,479
trapped in here so you're not losing

211
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,038
them to the outside

212
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,478
but there can also be times where

213
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,318
applying them to an outside environment

214
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,318
would be warranted
