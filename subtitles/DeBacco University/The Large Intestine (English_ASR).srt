1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
okay here we're gonna be looking at the

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,150
large intestine in some detail here so

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,129
remember it's a large intestine because

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,559
of its diameter not because of its

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,330
length so starting with the large

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,759
intestine in general or the colon as it

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,940
may be referred to it's only about 1.5

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,278
meters or 4.9 feet long in 7.5

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,310
centimeters or 3 inches wide it's give

10
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,230
you an approximation for humans it has a

11
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,149
larger diameter than these small

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,949
intestines the small intestine might be

13
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,108
longer but we're looking at large and

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,870
small being a comparison of the diameter

15
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,660
a no digestion and a little absorption

16
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,578
take place in the large intestine its

17
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,349
primary function is to act as a refuge

18
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,410
and dump by collecting and compacting

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,210
solid waste this is kind of the food

20
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,619
particles or what's left of them before

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,480
they're excreted out of the body

22
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,609
feces passed through the rectum as a

23
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:55,169
result of peristalsis and leave the body

24
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,460
through the anus now within our large

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,170
intestine looking at the histology

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,329
looking at kind of it's a cellular level

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,309
here the large intestine small intestine

28
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,409
which I didn't show the small intestine

29
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:07,079
is only showing a large are adapted for

30
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,118
digestive functions for each organ the

31
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,759
micrograph shows to call in simple

32
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,950
columnar epithelia goblet cells and

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,630
we're looking at them here and this why

34
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,228
you see this kind of like up and down

35
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:21,298
this kind of like large area here could

36
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:23,489
also see this here looking at that in

37
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,509
folds that do occur in the large

38
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:29,699
intestine in the micro villi is pointed

39
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,890
out here are very important in the small

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,939
intestine for absorbing food here in the

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,629
large intestine they're looking at

42
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:39,809
mostly absorbing or reabsorbing water to

43
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:42,239
avoid dehydration large intestine the

44
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,129
functions of the large intestine as I

45
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,589
mentioned there are two reabsorption of

46
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,810
the water and bile salts compact of

47
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,790
intestinal contents into feces

48
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,728
absorption of important vitamins

49
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,340
produced by bacteria a storage of fecal

50
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:59,099
material prior to the defecation process

51
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,020
before it's finally excreted out of the

52
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,709
body you can see where that's located

53
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:06,298
here now parts of the large intestine

54
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,549
it's all kind of talked about some of

55
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,110
those regions in a moment but we have

56
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,239
the cecum and if the appendix were

57
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,900
starting so this is an expanded pouch

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,310
receives materials arriving

59
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,590
the ilium that's the end part of the

60
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,680
small intestine mistura's materials and

61
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,799
begins the compaction process now the

62
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,450
appendix located right down here we're

63
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:27,849
seeing that this is a slender hollow

64
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:30,098
appendage only about you know nine

65
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:32,889
centimeters one point three inches long

66
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:35,318
is down it by lymph nodes and lifting

67
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:36,908
organs may be fair with appendicitis or

68
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:39,548
an issue and that's basically food

69
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:43,389
getting that I get trapped in here and

70
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:45,159
cause potential issues there now parts a

71
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:47,888
large intestine looking at the colon for

72
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:49,479
example here has a large diameter in

73
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:51,340
thinner wall than the small intestine

74
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:56,229
wall of the colon it forms a series of

75
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,658
pouches is Hoekstra permit expansion in

76
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:00,009
elongation of the colon so again we're

77
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:02,709
talking about the cecum we're going to

78
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:05,289
kind of work our way down and around

79
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:08,348
through the anatomy of in general in the

80
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:10,539
colon region so parts of the colon we

81
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:12,280
have the a sending : so

82
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:13,658
a setting means up and that's exactly

83
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,878
what's happening here it's the blue

84
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:18,159
region begins at the superior border of

85
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,018
the cecum and this a sending colon uses

86
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,969
muscle signal traction to push up any

87
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:24,209
undigested food products from the cecum

88
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:27,039
to the top of the abdominal cavity

89
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,359
cavity just below the right about an

90
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,400
edge of the liver so keep in mind the

91
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,930
liver is located about here and we're

92
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,120
working our way kind of within the large

93
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,919
intestine towards that region this sends

94
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,590
on the light lateral and posterior wall

95
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,599
of the peritoneal cavity and the

96
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,719
inferior surface of the liver and bends

97
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:46,089
to the right call it flexure so after we

98
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,739
go up this ascending colon we're going

99
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,039
to come across here and we're gonna have

100
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:54,099
the transverse colon this is the second

101
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,810
section to : its anterior abdominal wall

102
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:58,388
from the right to left hand side of the

103
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,158
ad immediately under the stomach so it

104
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:03,549
gives you the idea of exactly what we're

105
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,989
talking about within the body then we

106
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,340
have the descending colon of food

107
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,799
particles traveled down the descending

108
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,049
colon comes back down on the left side

109
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,159
of the admin close to the spleen and I

110
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,120
might be looking to see image initially

111
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,219
and say hey wait it's on the right side

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,340
keep in mind the weights oriented in the

113
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:20,908
body that would be your left side it's

114
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:25,119
attached to the abdominal wall

115
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:26,278
if the sigmoid here the very kinda end a

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,030
little s-shaped

117
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:29,709
again about that

118
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:32,319
I'm used to the six inches long at the

119
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:33,969
end of the colon lies pressed earier to

120
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,490
the urinary bladder and towards the

121
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:39,640
small intestine therefore terminating at

122
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:43,569
just before the rectum and that be the

123
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:46,449
very last component here and that last

124
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,670
parts that rectum region in red right

125
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,709
here number five and this graph this

126
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,530
image here around the end the large

127
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:55,419
intestine totally about 1/2 almost inch

128
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:57,879
and a half two point five to four

129
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,009
centimeters long this is where residual

130
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,509
waste hume lights and stretches on the

131
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,240
rectum until you feel the urge to go to

132
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:06,730
the bathroom and this is where you send

133
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,069
the signals had to basically excrete

134
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,720
that from the body and ultimately when

135
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:12,759
it is passing out of the body it's

136
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,890
leaving out the very end portion here

137
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,680
called the anus the rectum opens the

138
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,810
outside through the anus and she sees I

139
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,790
will exit through the anus and there's a

140
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,329
contractile sphincter little muscle

141
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,950
there that will help process that food

142
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:31,300
particles or the waste particles at this

143
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:33,250
point outside of the body lastly I've

144
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,169
mentioned here have a colonoscopy and

145
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,360
this is a test that allows for a visual

146
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,189
inspection of the interior lining of the

147
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,340
large intestine this helps doctors

148
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:44,079
identify ulcers polyps tumors and areas

149
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:46,959
of inflammation or bleeding say oh

150
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:50,109
please be collected for biopsy this is

151
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,299
how your colon should look this would be

152
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,330
a very large polyps would be numerous

153
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,220
small polyps and it's basically a camera

154
00:05:55,329 --> 00:06:00,550
going through there so doctors can get a

155
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,380
visual inspection in hopefully they will

156
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,930
see a nice smooth region if they see

157
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:08,339
these polyps they catch them early it

158
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,340
can be a life-saving procedure
