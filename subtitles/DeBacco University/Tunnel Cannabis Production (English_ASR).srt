1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
and when producing cannabis there's many

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,028
different ways to approach it and one of

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,669
them that's gaining popularity and the

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:11,280
outdoor world is use of tunnel

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:13,259
production so you ever see a poly tunnel

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,509
and it's a way to extend this season

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,050
here you miss is tends to be a little

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,100
bit longer season crop needing

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,670
benefiting from a warm protected

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,170
environment and these tunnels allow this

11
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,118
so first authors a comparison I should

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,400
provide with the comparison between high

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,778
tunnel production and greenhouses

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,339
well greenhouses are permanent

15
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,170
structures that have heat electricity

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,969
running to them generally speaking they

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,700
tend to be expensive but allow for full

18
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,760
year growing and are typically typically

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,350
covered large areas high tunnels are

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,058
basic structures have a covering that

21
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,789
allows for crop to protected as it grows

22
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,409
in general they're less expensive they

23
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,420
do extend the season but do not allow

24
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:55,169
for full your production you typically

25
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,429
cover 4,000 square feet or less now both

26
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,530
of these structures are showing the

27
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,119
greenhouse here the goal is to lengthen

28
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,859
the growing season this being a green

29
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,018
house can stretch it basically all year

30
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,379
round depending on the location and

31
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,570
natural growing season one may be

32
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:11,399
advantageous over the other may live an

33
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,798
environment to get some snow and maybe a

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,240
greenhouse would be a better choice just

35
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,049
trying to extend a portion of the season

36
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:22,228
and don't have quite the upfront capital

37
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,180
thoth if go through a provide a full

38
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:26,459
greenhouse structure maybe a high tunnel

39
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,110
would be a better option that budget is

40
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,699
a consideration because greenhouses are

41
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,349
much more expensive than high tunnels

42
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,759
and we can see here the snowy

43
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,368
environment with plants growing on the

44
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,280
inside just like it was summertime

45
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:40,019
height Ellis's is two examples here can

46
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,640
be the size of some greenhouses in

47
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:43,408
certain cases but they differ from

48
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,689
greenhouses and there's no supplemental

49
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,430
heat added and they left a permanent

50
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:50,039
floor these plants are planted directly

51
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,390
into the ground they have typically

52
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,040
roll-up sides to increase ventilation

53
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,409
for the plants you can see going down

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,509
the hallway here and they can be moved

55
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,460
easily to a new location and oftentimes

56
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,640
they're put out rollers to facilitate

57
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,949
this process between two areas

58
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,840
caterpillar tunnels are smaller than

59
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,090
your typical hoop house or high tunnel

60
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,219
and they do still offer plant protection

61
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,620
they're not very wide they tend to be

62
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:17,009
very long so again talking about 15

63
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,069
Ishi feet wide and candy Islam as in

64
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:21,479
this case and this was about 96 feet

65
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:22,919
easy to set up takes a full day with two

66
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,658
people the first time and then it came

67
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,458
to be done in kind of like one weekend

68
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:27,929
day after that they're not very

69
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,090
inexpensive option and they store very

70
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,340
nice and very easily can be moved it

71
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,640
still offers some plant protections

72
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,170
compared to those exposed to the outside

73
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,878
the main goal of tunnel production is

74
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:41,280
provide limited stress environment to

75
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,689
allow maximum yields little a little

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,598
stress can be a good thing but it's a

77
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:47,579
fine line so personally a high yielding

78
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,259
plants gonna have enough stress on it so

79
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,450
the girl doesn't you need to in tension

80
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,620
they really add anymore some people want

81
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,479
to say well I want to stress the plants

82
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,950
a little bit if they're growing at high

83
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,869
yields that's probably enough stress on

84
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:00,030
them simply extending that growing

85
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,829
season as possible by protecting the

86
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,199
plants from a night or two of cold

87
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:05,819
weather or atypical temperatures and

88
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,229
that can help again just stretch that

89
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:09,229
season even further
