1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,000
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,759
going to go over drying systems for

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,519
cannabis looking at both the hanging

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,040
drying system that we see here

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,279
as well as a rack system to give you

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:14,160
some of the pros and cons of each

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,640
as well as show you some actual examples

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,278
of cannabis drying so you can decide

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,160
what drying system is the best fit for

10
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,160
your situation

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,640
[Music]

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
all right let's get into drying systems

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,679
regarding uh cannabis

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,759
now here we're seeing a lot of hang

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,200
drying remembers also rack or screen

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,878
drying as another option

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,120
and we'll see both of those mentioned

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,718
here as well as going out to greenhouse

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,640
to also compare them

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,079
so first off just in general what is the

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,759
reason for drying

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,840
when we're looking at kind of drying the

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,839
goal is to produce dry flour that has

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,879
improved taste and flavors when ignited

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
because we're not just selling kind of

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,519
an end product

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
ideally that will be kind of gone

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,359
through and burned in some way

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,800
so the drying process goal is to improve

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,719
the taste and flavors

31
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,118
of that cannabis end product when it's

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,960
going through the point of ignition

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,640
now the drying process just in general

34
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,000
when we're looking at kind of the

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,560
process as it relates to cannabis this

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
should be viewed not as a race it's not

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,840
kind of to dry first

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,159
and get there first the goal is to

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,240
produce a quality end product

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,600
it's more about kind of the destination

41
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,359
and kind of getting there

42
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,280
this might take a little bit longer or

43
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,519
might want to wait another day to ensure

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,000
a quality end product

45
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,200
now the area that you'll be drying in

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,118
should be very clean

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,640
and tightly climate controlled and

48
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,438
that's true if it's a very small

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,118
area or it's a very large area it should

50
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,239
be very clean top to bottom

51
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:46,239
and very controlled of both temperature

52
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,438
light air circulation and the

53
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,959
all-important humidity as well

54
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,798
so what's things that you should be

55
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,239
avoiding in the drying area

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,799
when we're looking at the drying area

57
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,920
high heat and intense light can degrade

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,759
the cannabinoids

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,118
so we're saying no light and that's

60
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,319
ideal but you don't have to have

61
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,159
absolutely no light just to have

62
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,758
very muted light and it's okay if you

63
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
turn that muted light on and go into

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,479
that room

65
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,159
doesn't have to be 100 solid complete

66
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,879
darkness but make sure the light is

67
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,159
minimal

68
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,878
low intensity and a very short duration

69
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,159
we also want to avoid a speed drying so

70
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:19,598
we don't want to take a hair dryer to it

71
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,759
and speed dry because that will cause

72
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,878
larger buds not to dry consistently

73
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,719
which will lead to an

74
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,639
inferior end product and the whole goal

75
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,039
here is to produce that quality

76
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,799
end product so what are the two options

77
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,719
or the two main options we have the rack

78
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,599
or screen drying system you can see that

79
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,800
here

80
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,280
its advantages is that it requires uh

81
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,640
minimal space so it's great for large

82
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,360
volume harvest meaning they can be

83
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,199
easily stacked on top of one another

84
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,720
the disadvantage is it does create flat

85
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,878
spots on the buds and does

86
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,800
usually require some pruning to be done

87
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,560
ahead of time because that reduced space

88
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,439
you have a reduced plant material so you

89
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,280
can see here

90
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,719
now comparing it to the other system we

91
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,199
can see right here

92
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,039
we call it the plant hanging system so

93
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,878
in this example there's minimal prep

94
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,878
of the plant material ahead of drying so

95
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,560
that's what makes it advantageous

96
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,919
however the disadvantage is it does take

97
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,920
up more space

98
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,759
because that plant material is a greater

99
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,759
volume of that simple plant material

100
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,598
and it can have increased odds of

101
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,158
contaminants developing such as mold for

102
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:17,840
example

103
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,560
simply because you have so much more

104
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,120
material they both can produce a quality

105
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
end product so just keep that in mind

106
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,000
that the

107
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
end product should not really be based

108
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,560
on the system of drying we have to be a

109
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,319
little bit more careful

110
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,158
with the hanging system simply because

111
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,598
they have more plant volume now if

112
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,000
you've learned about these systems

113
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,959
let's go into kind of a drying area

114
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,318
situation

115
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
let's look at where we're going to see

116
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,958
some plants hanging some plants

117
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,878
drying on a rack or screen method to

118
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,039
give you in kind of a real world kind of

119
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,039
example of both of these systems

120
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,120
so you can ensure that you're selecting

121
00:03:49,039 --> 00:04:01,840
the one that is the best fit

122
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:02,640
for your given situation enjoy

123
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,959
so here we're looking at the

124
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,759
all-important drying process for

125
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,360
cannabis harvest and we can see the

126
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,199
large branches have been cut down and

127
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
hung upside down on a wire

128
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,159
the light relatively is minimal there's

129
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,680
a air circulation on the bottom behind

130
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,479
me there's also a

131
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,439
fan blowing to again help air moving

132
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,000
throughout the

133
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,240
under canopy here of the drying process

134
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,279
helping control humidity

135
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,360
allows this to dry down very evenly and

136
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,679
very consistently we don't want to have

137
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,720
like wet spots or areas of trapping

138
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
moisture because that could lead

139
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,040
potentially to disease

140
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,599
so we want to make sure we're having

141
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,639
this all be consistent and this is one

142
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
way we see here

143
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,879
that it can be achieved all right and

144
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,519
here we can see the drying process in

145
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,360
general

146
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,799
we see the fan blowing and we're seeing

147
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
kind of a little pathway which is

148
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,759
important for

149
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,918
people to be able to walk through but

150
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,840
we're also seeing the importance of the

151
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,758
ability for air to circulate we see a

152
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,918
little dehumidifier there

153
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,960
we are seeing some lights on which of

154
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,959
course is

155
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,120
important to be able to walk around but

156
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,359
again these are muted lights

157
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,439
this image here again is showing the

158
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
importance of that barrier under the

159
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,360
plants you do not want to have your

160
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,840
plants

161
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,080
directly touching the ground there now a

162
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,159
couple are getting some natural sunlight

163
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,599
and that's okay keep in mind that all

164
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,520
those fan leaves have been removed

165
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,240
the entire plants have been cut down and

166
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,519
there's that area of space below and we

167
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,000
also see the area

168
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,439
of space above because we want to have

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,680
even air circulation

170
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,879
around the entire plant material we

171
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,160
don't want to just have it at the bottom

172
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,360
just at the top you want to be mindful

173
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,880
of all those areas

174
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,800
as we're looking at the branches here we

175
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,478
can see many of those large fan leaves

176
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
have been removed which is great

177
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,478
it really aids in the drying down

178
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,600
process now on the ground there we're

179
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,918
also seeing some

180
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
tarping some plastic that helps again

181
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,639
trap any leaves that have fallen down

182
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,479
as well as maintain a humidity barrier

183
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,759
we've seen that here as well

184
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,159
looking kind of from the opposite end

185
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,879
looking down seeing a very consistent

186
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
harvest

187
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,639
seeing a lot of repetition very

188
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,959
important to allow

189
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,960
that efficient air circulation efficient

190
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,879
hanging efficient takedown process we

191
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,719
see some pink tags and some string

192
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,918
that can label them variety something of

193
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,240
interest so

194
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,918
making sure we have a method of labeling

195
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,759
and knowing when we harvested what we

196
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,639
harvested and what day

197
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,919
is all important documentation steps

198
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,759
that should be taken

199
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,198
we're saying here it's very early drying

200
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,240
process but we are seeing it is

201
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,319
initiated

202
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,840
so far looks like it's going pretty well

203
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,520
here so

204
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,038
monitoring is another important

205
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,000
component want to make sure that we're

206
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,560
setting everything up ahead

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
of time but also monitoring that and

208
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,600
making sure

209
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,720
at least everything is going in

210
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,280
generally

211
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,199
to plan so here we have different forms

212
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,000
of drying we can see a lot of the

213
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,360
dry product right here on screens all

214
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,478
kind of taken down

215
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,680
out of the field put here in a protected

216
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,120
greenhouse environment

217
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,959
yes there's some benches we're allowing

218
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,918
some air circulation below these are

219
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,399
actually also on

220
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,000
screens to again help that airflow

221
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,799
overall and allow that nice even

222
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
consistently

223
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,960
dry down of the product organized

224
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,800
not overly full in any one area so again

225
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,839
this just helps that drying process to

226
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
be very even

227
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,279
very efficient to allow ultimately for

228
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,439
the best product to be produced

229
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,198
now as we look going down this aisle

230
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,478
here of all the different cannabis plant

231
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,879
material drying

232
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,918
it is important that it is segregated it

233
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,918
is isolated

234
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,478
this can be from different lots this can

235
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,439
be different forms of grinding this can

236
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,079
be different

237
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,478
uh initial starting materials we do see

238
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,199
that

239
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,159
is they all are on screens and the

240
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,478
screens are on

241
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,240
benches and those benders are elevated

242
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:42,719
we are taking advantage of some of the

243
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,478
sun

244
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,280
here in this section of the greenhouse

245
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,959
to help again aid in the drying process

246
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,719
we'll notice that there are some tarps

247
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,918
in the background some shadier locations

248
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
where we're having the plants that are

249
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:56,959
actually

250
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,800
hung to dry but in this area we are

251
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,959
looking at the improvement

252
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
of utilizing the sun utilizing that air

253
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,038
circulation

254
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,878
to take full advantage of every

255
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,240
portion of the greenhouse environmental

256
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,680
conditions that we have

257
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,319
so here we're looking at a drying

258
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,360
process where we have all the kind of

259
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,680
hem plants here hung upside down while

260
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,038
for a lot of air circulation down here

261
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,879
uh and this is allowing for a very

262
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,519
efficient and very consistent

263
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,199
dry down of the buds and we can see this

264
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,758
goes on for quite a ways

265
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,038
this is about half acre of total plants

266
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,479
that have been harvested here and

267
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,399
initially dried down

268
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,759
and we could see it's being done here in

269
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,278
a very controlled manner

270
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,278
so that we're getting very consistent

271
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,080
harvest and very consistent yields off

272
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,918
everything

273
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,759
which is definitely important part of

274
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,039
the process

275
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,039
so here we're taking a look at the

276
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,759
drying process look at the actual dried

277
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,599
product

278
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,120
and we can see it's very consistent as

279
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,639
it's from the field

280
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,320
so we're going to have to deal with some

281
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,759
variability naturally with the field

282
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
but we're looking at the drying process

283
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,720
keeping that humidity keeping the light

284
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,159
relatively low

285
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,759
keeping the air circulation going

286
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,600
preventing moisture from building up

287
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,600
when they all kind of come together you

288
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,360
can get a nice consistent product that

289
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
looks like this

290
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
now looking our way down the greenhouse

291
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,639
we can see it the tabletop benches

292
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,479
are being used with some of the branches

293
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,480
here uh going through

294
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,839
and drying them down pruning a lot of

295
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,519
the leaves off removing that

296
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,040
putting them on the benches we see the

297
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,600
vast majority here the most efficient

298
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,958
method is hanging those branches

299
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,360
on the wire that's been strung on this

300
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:30,879
greenhouse on both sides we have kind of

301
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
light blocking tarps so we're not

302
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,200
getting

303
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,440
full intense light it's also helping

304
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,399
reduce the amount of heat that we get in

305
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,320
the greenhouse

306
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,440
those fans running behind me here they

307
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
can keep air moving

308
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,279
so that's also important to be sure that

309
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,480
we're not letting air get stagnant we

310
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,759
don't want moisture to develop and

311
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
that's very important

312
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,000
especially at the sunrise and sunset

313
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,759
times during this fall time of year

314
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,519
to bring that moisture from building up

315
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,120
within the structure because ultimately

316
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,080
that could lead to increased chance of

317
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,159
getting bud rot

318
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,920
molds developing and when you have this

319
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,480
much material it could spread very

320
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,439
quickly

321
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,519
if you allow it to initially get started

322
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,079
now here as we walk down the aisle we

323
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,879
can see

324
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,000
very clearly uh the organization of all

325
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,399
those plants hanging

326
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,720
above us we see the hanging methane

327
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,799
being utilized but we're also noticing

328
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,079
on the bench tops we're seeing kind of

329
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,639
like a rack system

330
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,559
also being utilized and it's important

331
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,039
kind of maximize the space that you have

332
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,719
and

333
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,559
kind of ran out of space to hang the

334
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,200
plants so why not use

335
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,799
the natural bench space looking here

336
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
these are a little further along that we

337
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,278
saw

338
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,278
in the early part of the video and we

339
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,159
can see again those fan leaves are

340
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:40,480
evenly removed allowing for those buds

341
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,600
even air circulation and really helps

342
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,399
that drying process

343
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,159
in general also notice that for the most

344
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,759
part while we are in a greenhouse we are

345
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,759
trying to minimize some of the light

346
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,039
and in the background there we can see

347
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,759
that there's definitely

348
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,120
some black plastic and tarps up we're

349
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,078
also noticing and probably hearing a

350
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,879
little bit

351
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,679
of fan moving so again air circulation

352
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,559
is important and that's a key factor

353
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,239
there

354
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,159
to be considerate especially when you're

355
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,839
in a greenhouse sometimes those vents

356
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,639
can open and close but we really want to

357
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,839
make sure

358
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,039
we're allowing air to always be moving

359
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,040
through those plants

360
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,480
you can see here just kind of the end

361
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,439
product of that when you are getting

362
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,879
that fan moving

363
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,040
it might be a little bit annoying to be

364
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,320
in there it definitely does help the

365
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,000
overall process

366
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,760
not heavily blowing on the plants but

367
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,679
again keeping that air moving

368
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,120
keeping that humidity from building up

369
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,719
in any one location

370
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,480
now lastly something we do want to

371
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,519
consider as we are removing buds

372
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,440
from the branches is the disposal of the

373
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,200
leftover plant material

374
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
cannabis plants do tend to produce kind

375
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
of stocks that are kind of woody in

376
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:46,399
nature so we want to be mindful of that

377
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,480
we want to be having a plan that

378
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,559
we're going to have to dispose of these

379
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,120
at the end of the harvest cycle

380
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,958
when we take the valuable buds off the

381
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,759
plants and get those dried down

382
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,838
hopefully this was helpful and you're

383
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,240
welcome to sketch any other videos here
