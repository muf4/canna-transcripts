1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,199
so talk about the importance of drying

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,580
candidates properly so if it should take

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,919
you inside the drying room

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,780
now while drying can occur outdoors it

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,570
is definitely not advised because of the

6
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:16,048
variability that can occur the rain the

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,300
humidity the fog not a great area to

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:20,309
allow efficient drying to be done in the

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,189
room was controlled conditions I'm going

10
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:25,140
to go over what those conditions are so

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,820
it's very important to have a clean room

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,099
with excellent environmental control

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,439
want to have tight regulations over the

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,390
temperature to look around 65 degrees

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,058
Fahrenheit 18 degrees Celsius in

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,609
humidity starting at about 45% and

17
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,530
decreasing throughout the process it's

18
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:43,378
important also this room has very little

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,629
light that's at least on other than when

20
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:47,640
someone's in there inspecting it's also

21
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,920
a good idea to have even air circulation

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,259
but do not have a fan directly blood on

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,030
the on the drying buds gotta kind of

24
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,829
want to keep the air just moving in the

25
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,058
room but not in any one hot spot they're

26
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,820
monitoring the conditions is definitely

27
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:05,219
advised because this will have a great

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,450
impact on your final product integrating

29
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:08,129
a monitoring system that can ensure

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,680
consistent conditions will improve the

31
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,868
dry room the dry room conditions and

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,670
help ensure a consistent product so

33
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:18,390
having a way of monitoring and checking

34
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:21,269
and tracking are all systems definitely

35
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,140
well advised for the for the dry room

36
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:26,759
here now the placement of those buds can

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,200
be put on screens that are not

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,959
surrounded by leaves to keep the drying

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,040
process even inconsistent so that's kind

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,259
of the name of the game here whenever

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,000
anything I'll pal up in one area you can

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,310
see all these different rungs it's all

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,069
pretty much one blood thick they're not

44
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,200
really piled on top of one another very

45
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:45,209
very deep to allow that kind of even

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,829
drying process typically these screens

47
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,478
structures are hung from the ceiling to

48
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:50,849
allow good air circulation you can see

49
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,560
there's multiple in this room here some

50
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:54,449
growers this is not an example one that

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,670
some girls like convertible racks they

52
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,409
can help avoid flat spots we save labor

53
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,600
while increasing the overall air

54
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,579
circulation what these invertible racks

55
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,559
allow them growers to do is they're all

56
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,658
sealed they can learn there's a hanging

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,979
here and a hanger on top they can take

58
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:13,340
this whole rack flip it upside down and

59
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,650
rehang it now from what what does

60
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,229
see the bottom to help increase the

61
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,480
tumbling of those buds at least once to

62
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:21,949
allow for a better air circulation you

63
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,469
want to be sure to label each harvest

64
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:26,750
screen with a date variety and person

65
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:28,539
doing the harvesting as we see here you

66
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,909
expect me to ensure the room conditions

67
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:34,128
and evidence for even drying and that

68
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:36,709
person of harvesting is also important

69
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:38,899
to tell how the buds are trimmed

70
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,759
potentially or how they're drying or how

71
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,189
they were placed and also knowing the

72
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:46,219
cultivar in the variety and when it was

73
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:47,900
harvested a way to determine the degree

74
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:49,400
of dryness or they're ready for the

75
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,879
curing process do something called a

76
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,549
stem test if you take the area and near

77
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,068
the buds and you try to bend the stem

78
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:59,930
area if it bends then there's still some

79
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:02,149
dry time required if it snaps you're

80
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,709
ready for the curing process larger

81
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,360
denser buds may take a little longer to

82
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,519
completely dry so double check the

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,290
moisture content on these even when the

84
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,150
majority of the other buds may be dry

85
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:14,598
those may have to just go a little bit

86
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,670
longer now dry thyme freshly harvick

87
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,039
should be dried and ready for packaging

88
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:23,119
process in about seven to ten days some

89
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:25,608
can cut it as low as 5 to 7 typically

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,230
going over 10 is not advised the goals

91
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:29,719
of panel moisture content between 12 and

92
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:33,048
15 percent so if you harvest here on

93
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:36,500
Friday the 20s you're looking at 7 to 10

94
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:39,319
days would be your ideal dry time window

95
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,769
to get the max amount of time for profit

96
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:43,729
producing the highest quality buds now

97
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,049
in the dry run movements and some

98
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:46,638
conditions you want to have you also

99
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:48,530
want to avoid some conditions

100
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,419
particularly light UV light in

101
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,459
particular I don't want to have a lot of

102
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,769
that in the room heat above 80 degrees

103
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,989
Fahrenheit or 26 degrees Celsius and

104
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:58,159
friction which removes all the resins I

105
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:59,870
mean you don't wanna put the buds on

106
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,418
this kind of screen and then shake it

107
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,579
all around to get them to dry because

108
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:07,069
that could remove a lot of the resins

109
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,079
and we to see overall quality there of

110
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:10,189
the buds so this goes over some

111
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,750
conditions that you should have in the

112
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:13,430
dry room what you should look for in

113
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,389
some conditions you should be avoiding

114
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,750
to allow high quality buds for your

115
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,750
harvest
