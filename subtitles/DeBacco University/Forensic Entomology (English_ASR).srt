1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
so welcome to this video here at debaco

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,160
university

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,480
looking at forensics entomology so how

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,280
do

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,320
insects relate to forensics and in their

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,599
involvement within

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,960
crime scenes even though they're

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,000
probably not the ones committing the

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,000
crime

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
so entomology in general what is that

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,519
referring to well the

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,439
entomology is the study of insects in

13
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,160
relationship to humans environment

14
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920
and other organisms entomologists make

15
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
great contributors to such

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
diverse fields such as agriculture

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,840
looking at crop loss or potential pests

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,399
chemistry biology human and animal

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
health

20
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,840
molecular sciences criminology and the

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,439
focus today

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,920
is forensic so insects have a lot of

23
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,119
contributions and a lot of potential

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,480
areas of study

25
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,519
within multiple areas within science so

26
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,279
why study insects well insect species

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,559
arrive at a corpse in waves like

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,359
clockwork so when we're looking at a

29
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,919
crime scene

30
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,719
why are we looking at insects well they

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,359
have a very

32
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,800
distinctive and repeatable habit this

33
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,558
because of this it provides a good

34
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,239
estimation of the time

35
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:11,200
that has passed since the individual has

36
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,079
perished so this is a great reason why

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,000
entomology or

38
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,679
insects are such a major focus within

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,040
forensics

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,118
now this forensics entomology flies in

41
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,880
maggots also provide an approximate time

42
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:23,920
of death which is very useful in cases

43
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,879
where the body

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
has been long dead we're not necessarily

45
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,158
fresh on the scene

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,400
it's happened over a period of time and

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,600
discovered later entomology can play a

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
great role in that

49
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,438
because only certain insects will feed

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,439
and light eggs on a dead corpse

51
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,519
and the forensics entomologists can

52
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,519
study these insects their larval cycles

53
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,438
and they're after and can determine

54
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,078
whether the body has been dead for just

55
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,639
one day

56
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,559
or up to three or four weeks potentially

57
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,920
so again great resource

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,478
for information there now antomonas aid

59
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,000
in

60
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,438
this process in this process of studying

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
of the

62
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,959
persons who have passed away by

63
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,799
identifying the insects in the various

64
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,399
stages of their life cycle so not only

65
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,920
knowing what insects are there

66
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,159
but are they the egg stage the larval

67
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,318
stage or present as adults

68
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,000
by collecting and preserving insects as

69
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,919
evidence this can ensure proper

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,199
preservation procedures and ensure that

71
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,079
those insects are

72
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,679
kind of frozen in time there this can

73
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,840
help determine the estimate of

74
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,840
postmortem interval or pmi

75
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,680
time between death and the discovery of

76
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,680
the body which can help provide

77
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,120
an approximation for where further

78
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,480
investigation should be

79
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,759
focused on factors such as insect

80
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,039
evidence the weather that's the

81
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,799
conditions that have occurred the

82
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,719
location and condition the body are all

83
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
useful as well

84
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,400
entomologists can also testify in court

85
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,518
to explain insect related evidence found

86
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,519
in the crime scene

87
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,000
and as a result they can aid by

88
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,319
providing expert testimony

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
now insect species and time so when

90
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,318
we're looking at the species and the

91
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,719
actual time that's passed by

92
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,598
we can calculate the heat slash thermal

93
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,199
energy

94
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,878
which is accumulated in degree hours

95
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,719
required for each stage

96
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,639
of for example here the green bottle

97
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,680
flies life cycle just one insect that

98
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,279
can be used

99
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,519
possibly the greatest potential source

100
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,439
of error is using the arthropods

101
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,519
successional patterns lies in the

102
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,280
collection of the actual specimens

103
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,840
this is why entomologists will typically

104
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,519
be used and focused in on this area to

105
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,799
ensure accuracy

106
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,719
most only done correctly to accurate

107
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
sample the insects so we want to make

108
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,080
sure we're getting a good sample

109
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,439
but also we're getting the correct

110
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,760
sampling of those

111
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,519
insects in the various life cycles that

112
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,759
we may notice

113
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,840
so insects typically that we'll be

114
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,639
focusing on would be like flies or

115
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,200
beetles

116
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,878
species may also provide clues and some

117
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,399
feed on fresh corpses while others

118
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,439
prefer ones that have been dead for a

119
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,920
couple of weeks

120
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,000
so again proper identification can

121
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,199
really help a forensic scientist try to

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
pinpoint

123
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,039
the time of death which can help further

124
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,199
investigation

125
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,199
and allocation of resources
