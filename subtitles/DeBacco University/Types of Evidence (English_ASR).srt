1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,120
so here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,879
we're going to be investigating

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,839
different types of evidence

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,359
and how we may go about classifying them

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,400
so when we're looking at two main

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,160
categories for

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,919
evidence it's important to know what

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,039
category the evidence you're collecting

9
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:16,399
falls into

10
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,198
for example whether it's a direct or

11
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,278
testimonial with circumstantial such as

12
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,400
a physical piece of evidence

13
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:26,480
this main broad classification of

14
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,239
evidence that may be collected now

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,000
direct or testimonial evidence includes

16
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,439
first-hand observations

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,359
such as testimonies from eyewitness

18
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,759
accounts written statements confessions

19
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,320
or

20
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,640
video cameras testimonies may sound

21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
convincing but need to be cross-examined

22
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,878
so even if we get those shortly after

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,558
a crime has been committed keep in mind

24
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,159
because it is classified as this direct

25
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,759
evidence or testimonial evidence

26
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,439
we need to back that up with other

27
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,159
supporting data

28
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,839
now circumstantial or physical evidence

29
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,878
this is indirect evidence that can be

30
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,440
used to imply

31
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,960
a fact but does not directly prove it it

32
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,558
refers to any evidence that would be

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,320
present at the crime scene but also

34
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,358
includes items found in the suspect's

35
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,040
possession

36
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
so just because it wasn't found directly

37
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,840
at the crime scene

38
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,400
it may be necessary to investigate and

39
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,439
use that because it may show or tie a

40
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,799
better story

41
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,798
to be able to determine the full

42
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,000
idea of what had happened at the crime

43
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,520
scene

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,040
we also have different types of evidence

45
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,399
so with these different types we're

46
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,159
looking at what are some examples of

47
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,799
circumstantial or physical evidence

48
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,320
that could be collected at a crime scene

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,079
so be thinking about these different

50
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,679
types of physical evidence

51
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,239
again something as simple as a trash can

52
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,960
here all sorts of dna fingerprints hair

53
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,959
all sorts of things can be collected

54
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,039
here's some evidence examples so here we

55
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,798
have blood here fiber soil glass tire

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,240
marks paint chips explosive tool marks

57
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,799
firearms ballistics

58
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,679
shell casings pollen dna these are just

59
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,000
some evidence

60
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,079
examples that can all be very important

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,078
to a crime scene

62
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,359
now if we look here how could you how

63
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,078
could these types of evidence be

64
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,679
classified

65
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,039
further so if we have all these

66
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,079
different types these fingerprints tool

67
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,159
marks blood

68
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,000
uh soil class tire marks how could we go

69
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,200
about classifying these

70
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,159
so again be thinking about these are

71
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,598
things that could be collected at a

72
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,199
crime scene how do we potentially

73
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,439
classify them

74
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,560
well looking at here's just some

75
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,639
examples of some broad

76
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
forms of classification we get that

77
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,919
circumstantial physical evidence and

78
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,360
detailed classifications while we have

79
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,639
biological evidence

80
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,800
that include body fluids hair natural

81
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,238
fibers plant parts and dna

82
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,000
there were some physical components that

83
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,159
could be like bullets or

84
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,919
casings or artificial fibers or tool

85
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,799
marks and then we get into trace

86
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,639
evidence

87
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,920
this refers to physical evidence that's

88
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,719
found in small

89
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,479
but measurable quantities it helps the

90
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,400
investigator to not only

91
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,878
identify what to look for but to also

92
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,439
find them and collect them in a way

93
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,439
that preserves them so they can be used

94
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,079
and entered as evidence for a crime

95
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,079
scene
