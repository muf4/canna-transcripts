1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,310
okay here we're look at animal phylum

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:07,589
and key transitions that occur allowing

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:09,750
us to determine which animals are more

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,080
primitive and which ones are more

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,940
advanced in certain features so we're

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,410
looking at these transitions we're

7
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,929
looking at transitions in the body plan

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,429
and they're marked by these six key

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,289
points and I'm going to go over each of

10
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,778
these in detail but here's the basic

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,380
overview we have presence or absence of

12
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:31,410
tissues bilateral symmetry a presence of

13
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:33,329
a body cavity segmentation if the

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,619
organism molt and deuterostome

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,420
development so starting first year

16
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:42,299
tissues is the first key transition in

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,340
the animal body plan only para ZOA the

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:48,299
splendas alack defined tissues and

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,160
organs all other animals have tissues so

20
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,280
this lack of this kind of defined

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,948
tissues here is a key way to identify a

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,780
sponge these labels exist as aggregates

23
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:00,439
of cells with minimal intercellular

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,000
coordination this means is kind of

25
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,069
exists as a grits of cells we it's

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,469
composed of cells but aggregates just

27
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,899
simply means a collection of cells yes

28
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,459
they're organized to some degree but

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,680
there's minimal inter Selleck

30
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,390
coordination meaning there's mineral

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,340
specialization within all the cells

32
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,629
there each kind of all performing the

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,060
same function they're not getting very

34
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:28,289
specialized and this is key in the sea

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:30,210
sponge further examples here we have

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,220
bilateral symmetry what does this mean

37
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:35,158
well here's our sponge and we could see

38
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,688
there's no real symmetry there we have

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,820
something called radial symmetry never

40
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:40,699
virtually all animals other than sponges

41
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:43,078
haven't defined symmetry of sometimes

42
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,939
radial here is the body plan which all

43
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,609
parts of the body are arranged around a

44
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,199
central axis any plane passing through

45
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,299
the central axis divides the orbit in

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,609
half approximately a mirror image

47
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,430
this is radial and you're just forming

48
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:58,530
all these radii the bilateral symmetry

49
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,689
on the other hand is this one

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,099
distinctive plane of symmetry the body

51
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:05,548
plan with the sync of right and left

52
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:08,179
halves are mirror images this plan the

53
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,500
bilateral symmetry allows for special

54
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,789
specialization among body regions and

55
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,229
more efficient movement so

56
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:15,699
looking at just the symmetry bilateral

57
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:18,009
symmetry would save you more advanced

58
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:19,328
animals in a radial symmetry try to put

59
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:22,509
that in a little bit of a picture here

60
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:24,790
as you can see animal ancestor asymmetry

61
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,858
the sponges very basic radial symmetry

62
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:29,739
are cnidarians and in all these

63
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:31,390
bilateral symmetry examples of animals

64
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:34,359
have the stinked right and left halves

65
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:38,259
more efficient movement and considered

66
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:40,120
more advanced the third key that body

67
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:42,759
cavity is important step in animal

68
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,009
evolution internal space allowed for the

69
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,068
support organs distribution of materials

70
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:50,048
in coordination and of development I

71
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:52,119
just chose a picture of the human here

72
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:55,450
so we're going to go over some body

73
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,030
systems again this does not only pertain

74
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:59,530
to humans probably think of us as I mean

75
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,259
a cranial cavity thoracic cavity

76
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,688
abdominal cavity pelvic cavity this is

77
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:06,608
just one example of development of body

78
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:10,870
cavities being a key step in animal

79
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:12,760
evolution consuming their segmentations

80
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,329
subdivisions of body which is a key

81
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:18,039
transition into the animal body plan so

82
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,409
each segment can develop more or less

83
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,598
complete set of adult organ systems and

84
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:24,698
can be used from moving around so the

85
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,469
more segments an animal has we see here

86
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,449
can allow potentially for more

87
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:30,009
specialization more efficient and

88
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:32,409
movement and this is what we're

89
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:34,298
considering to be an advancement in the

90
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:35,978
development of the body plan versus

91
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:39,219
something that's just kind of very basic

92
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:42,519
here more segments the chance for more

93
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:45,158
specialization this is kind of cool

94
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,658
image here molting without a shedding

95
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,780
process that allows for new growth took

96
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:51,848
her this is cicada here in the Northeast

97
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,789
you may hear him in the summertime that

98
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:57,548
they make that really loud sound

99
00:03:53,789 --> 00:04:00,188
typically in well nice warm late July or

100
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:02,739
August a molting those come in now for

101
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:04,930
our cicada but for snakes and crabs and

102
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,359
scorpions they also participate in this

103
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,280
molting process I have some great top

104
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:13,209
molting animals link if you wanted to do

105
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:18,639
that for snakes crabs and scorpions kind

106
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:21,519
of a cool air the most complicated one

107
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,348
here due to some development so what is

108
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,079
this a mouth developed separately from

109
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:27,878
the blastopore so in this diagram show

110
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,740
the difference of two majors elevates

111
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,229
based on the basic pattern of

112
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,340
development so we have our protostomes

113
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:35,438
and deuterostomes

114
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:37,478
protostomes are more primitive they

115
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,449
include flat worms nematode smallest

116
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:42,639
annelids and they're very basic

117
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:46,240
deuterostomes have evolved from

118
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,519
protostomes more than 630 million years

119
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,139
ago now initiative we look at and see

120
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,750
some similarities but there's some key

121
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:55,840
differences here in the deuterostomes is

122
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,029
located down here the blastula is called

123
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,649
the radial cleavage we talked about

124
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,809
cleavage sure being splitting or

125
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:03,638
dividing of cells because it curves

126
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,120
parallel or perpendicular to the major

127
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:10,780
polar axis we also see our disarms the

128
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,098
development here of a digestive tube not

129
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:14,218
really present here the protostomes

130
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:16,750
protostomes think more primitive and

131
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:19,718
protostomes leaves are called as you see

132
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,629
here spiral because division planes are

133
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:25,689
oriented have an oblique way to the

134
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:27,028
polar major axis so we're Steve

135
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:30,669
initially this kind of eight cell stage

136
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:32,978
here radial cleavage or radial dividing

137
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:36,189
of cells versus our spiral dividing of

138
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:39,478
cells here the development of different

139
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:42,699
organizations during gastrulation and

140
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,949
our deuterostomes are more developed

141
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:48,189
here because we have that development of

142
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,658
a digestive tube so that word cleavage

143
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:52,000
again I'm going to be the first thing

144
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:53,560
you may think of but division or split

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,500
is how it's going to be referred to here

146
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,319
in science process by which a zygote

147
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,088
divides by mitosis to form new cells so

148
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,338
here as I go through cleavage to form

149
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:06,038
our eight cell stage more cleavage more

150
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:08,129
dividing of those cells more cytokinesis

151
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:10,598
if you all and we see more and more

152
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,009
intensive cells packed in here during

153
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:13,899
embryonic development the zygote

154
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:15,699
undergoes a series of mitotic divisions

155
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:18,579
or cleavages from an eight cell stage

156
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:21,218
and then allows a hollow plasterer

157
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:23,288
during the process called gastrulation

158
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:25,689
the blaster forms in word and forms a

159
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:29,288
cavity again and this is showing or

160
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:31,300
indicating more specialization last

161
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:33,068
slide here looking at major amplify on

162
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,588
the diagram below shows the body plans

163
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:37,300
for nine major problem animal remember

164
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:39,939
each can be traced back to a common

165
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,160
animal ancestor and we see them dividing

166
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:43,250
out

167
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,700
here each with different complexities

168
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,629
and each with different individuals that

169
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,329
represent them

170

describe each of these in a little bit
