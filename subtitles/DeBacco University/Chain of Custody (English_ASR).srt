1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
all right so here on this tobacco

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,280
university video we're gonna be looking

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,919
at the chain

4
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:08,400
of custody and how this relates to crime

5
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,960
scene in the processing and handling of

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,559
evidence so first of all what is the

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,519
chain of custody well chain of custody

8
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,919
is a record

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,839
a recorded list of all persons who come

10
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,039
in possession of an item of

11
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,518
evidence so the goal is to maintain

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,720
a document that includes exactly what

13
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,799
happened to the evidence

14
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,839
from the time it was found to the time

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,920
it is presented

16
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,518
in court anyone that goes to see it and

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,440
when that gets passed on

18
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,679
that chain of custody that chain that's

19
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,000
you're able to follow a paper trail

20
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,320
of where the evidence went now the

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,119
requirements of the chain of custody

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,640
here

23
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,000
we want to have the list of evidence

24
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,039
including the item number and a brief

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,479
description

26
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,239
this identifies the location the item

27
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,238
was stored the date and time of all

28
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,000
transfers that may have occurred

29
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,679
signature from the individual releasing

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,719
the evidence to another individual or

31
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,840
location

32
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,600
the signature of the individual

33
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,320
transporting the evidence if if it

34
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
applies

35
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,759
the same trade individual receiving the

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,359
evidence from the other individual or

37
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,518
location and the reason

38
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,519
for that transfer so as you can see

39
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,200
there's a lot of requirements associated

40
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,879
here with the chain of custody

41
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,200
but it is a very important process here

42
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,920
now the presentation of the chain of

43
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,040
custody

44
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
well when we're looking here the

45
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,799
evidence container must have identified

46
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,280
markings the collector's

47
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,118
initials should be placed on the seal as

48
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,879
well if evidence is turned over to

49
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,599
another person the transfer must be

50
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,759
recorded

51
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,118
as an evidence of transmissional sheet

52
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,640
and it is very important that

53
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,159
documentation is made

54
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
so that that piece of evidence that was

55
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,118
collected can uphold in

56
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,799
the court of law lastly what is one of

57
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,560
those transmissional sheets look like

58
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
well here's just an example of one

59
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,478
and they're all documents the chain of

60
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,640
custody for a list of items of evidence

61
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,640
that are numbered consecutively

62
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,159
so we see kind of these examples of

63
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
these transmissional sheets here

64
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,000
all the information that's required so

65
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,159
all the hard work that went into

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
acquiring the evidence to begin with and

67
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,200
ensures it isn't tampered with in any

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,920
way and it can hold

69
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,920
up in the investigation of a crime scene
