1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,928
so how do physical body barriers relate

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:06,778
to the immune system and more

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:09,029
specifically how do the three images I

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,589
included here relate to that well the

5
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:12,209
reason why I've put these images here is

6
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:15,960
to see if you can make connections

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,640
between typically non-traditional immune

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,699
system pictures to see how they do

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,399
relate physical body barriers well the

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,220
sense here is representing that physical

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,719
barrier so does our skin the shoe

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,160
stepping in gum here that sticky

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,070
substance is going to represent the

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,960
mucus which is important for trapping

15
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,359
potential invading microorganisms and

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,179
the bottle here of the unknown kind of

17
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,340
acid poison is going to represent our

18
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,460
stomach acid on way we chemically

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,440
combative aiders so more specifically

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,939
I'm securing our borders at first line

21
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,839
of defense that skin those mucous

22
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,789
membranes

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,030
you may remember keratin in the skin

24
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,489
component of our hair prevents or acts

25
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,640
as a very strong physical barrier to

26
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:02,369
most microorganisms it's also resistant

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,010
to weak acids and bases bacterial

28
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:08,670
enzymes in toxins so this keratin is a

29
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,670
very strong substance and acts as a

30
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,010
great physical barrier in addition we

31
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,900
have her mucus what you've ever been a

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,210
little sick and sneeze you may notice

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,850
this kind of sticky gelatinous kind of

34
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:22,319
material that's called mucus and it

35
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:25,199
provides similar protection to

36
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,839
mechanical barriers coach the hairs it

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,219
traps inhaled particles it's also part

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,950
of the upper respiratory tract that's

39
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:35,219
ciliated so they sweep dust particles

40
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,439
from the lower respiratory passages this

41
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,289
kind of sticky substance acts as a way

42
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,239
of trapping some of these invading

43
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,149
organisms that we may take in and

44
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,328
breathe in this sticky substance just as

45
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,769
we feel it sticky is what's trapping

46
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:52,078
those organisms that can then be swept

47
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:52,589
up through and ultimately digested in

48
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,469
the stomach

49
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,329
now the stomach itself has its own line

50
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:03,239
of defense and that produces chemicals

51
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:05,609
particularly we have acid so our skin is

52
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,149
slightly acidic at three to five pH and

53
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:10,978
that is able to inhibit bacterial growth

54
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,989
keep in mind that our digestive tract

55
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,610
such as our stomach can be

56
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,680
hydric low

57
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:20,580
acid-producing very low pH some times

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,140
right around the pH of 2 sebum earwax

59
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,020
and these chemicals also toxic to

60
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,089
bacterial saliva tears also contains

61
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,489
I'll let lysozymes

62
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,709
mucus traps micro raisins enter the

63
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:35,310
digestive and respiratory systems so you

64
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:38,098
could see many of these our body has a

65
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,180
lot of these physical ways to combat

66
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:41,179
potential invaders
