00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
here in this tobacco university video if

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,160
you're looking at growing a cannabis

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,839
field and managing your weeds by mowing

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,919
this video will provide you with some

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,559
specifics and some ideas

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,160
to consider uh so you maintain a

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,919
hopefully a weed-free field

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,920
and increase your production

9
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:24,800
[Music]

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,038
all right let's get into mowing to

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,920
manage weeds in a cannabis field

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,199
well first off i want to plant before

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,960
mowing

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,239
so while some growers will simply mow

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,039
the weeds to make this

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,519
method more effective i'll plant a cover

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,839
crop

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,559
in rose at the time of planting the main

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,640
crop

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,479
so we can see here while this isn't

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,039
cannabis this is a squash and pumpkin

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,159
field

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,840
here we see a lot of grass being planted

24
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,519
and this can be a grass and clover mix

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
is very common because it's easy to

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,719
establish in the soil

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,439
and it also limps the potential for

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,000
erosion this also provides a great cover

29
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,718
crop

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
to be easily mowed before the vines in

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,520
this case

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
start to crawl over the area so we just

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,320
wanted to mow the weeds in this case

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,479
we're intentionally planting

35
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,798
cover crop in between our rows and then

36
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,039
mowing that cover crop

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,560
and that requires established rows so

38
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,000
here we're seeing uh grapevines we're

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
seeing buckwheat planted

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,920
having established rows can help be

41
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,159
helpful in defining the areas

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,200
this can be used from year to year

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,118
particularly with these

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,680
more perennial crops here and buckwheat

45
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,400
great here at maintaining the soil grows

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,960
really quickly

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,159
attracts pollinators a lot of benefits

48
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,199
and because it's planted in this

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,799
consistent row

50
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,439
this can allow mowing to be a very

51
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,520
effective method of control

52
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,359
and also of managing this particular

53
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,280
area so when it comes to establishing

54
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,040
those rows we want to be mindful of the

55
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,960
row spacing that we're using

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
the rows should be spaced to allow the

57
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,719
mowing equipment you'll be using an

58
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,478
easy pass or two it was just going to be

59
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,920
one pass down the row maybe one passed

60
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,718
down turn around and come back the other

61
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,399
way

62
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,919
this needs to be established early in

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,320
the season so be thinking

64
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,600
long term to save you time in season you

65
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,078
want to do something that's like a

66
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,000
pass and a half or three passes you want

67
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,159
to try to match it to whatever equipment

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,439
that you're using to make it easy for

69
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,239
you to go through and

70
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,719
manage that particular area lastly when

71
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,280
we're

72
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,919
relating this to cannabis production

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,159
selecting

74
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,318
a low-growing cover crop or even a turf

75
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,479
grass species can be preferable

76
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,560
this will allow easier mowing and help

77
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,359
limit soil erosion both good things to

78
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,520
be considering

79
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,959
adding a clover species as we see here

80
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,959
can also help encourage nitrogen

81
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,560
fixation in between the rows

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
and while this will not benefit your

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
in-row crop it can help the

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,639
general soil biology and if you do

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,959
rotate in the field at a later date

86
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,238
it will help future plantings as well

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,719
and with anything we always want to be

88
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,599
thinking

89
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,959
long-term to treat our soil well because

90
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,598
we treat the soil well

91
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,400
we'll have our plants be very productive

92
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,560
and allow us

93
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,519
long-term production which will be good

94
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,120
for the environment

95
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,120
as well as our total yield
