1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
okay here I'm going to provide a brief

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,778
overview of the muscular system paying

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,660
particular attention to these different

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:11,789
types of muscle tissue and also the

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,730
sliding filament theory in a general

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,710
sense so first off muscle tissue lets

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,589
the body move well distinguishing

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,350
characteristics of muscle cells is the

9
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,899
abundance of contractile protein fibers

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,840
these are called microfilaments that are

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,570
made up of actin and myosin when a

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,058
muscle contracts and we pull in our

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,219
muscles what's happening is that actin

14
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,558
and myosin are sliding past one another

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,840
and this is that part of the sliding

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,250
filament theory there's three different

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,230
kinds of muscle cells

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:49,250
there's skeletal smooth and cardiac

19
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:51,839
skeletal is we call striated tubular

20
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,960
multinucleated fibers and they're

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,910
typically attached to the skeleton

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,948
examples would be the bicep and they are

23
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:00,869
voluntary muscles mean we have control

24
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:04,349
over them we can choose when to move

25
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:07,200
them and those are our skeletal muscles

26
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,719
smooth muscle is a spindle shaped non

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,960
striated unicellular fibers each fabric

28
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,090
contains only one cell and one nucleus

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,118
it's found in the walls of internal

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,189
organs such as your intestines and this

31
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,799
is involuntary mean this moves on its

32
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:25,139
own without conscious control last part

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,380
here is cardiac and striated branched

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,719
Union occluded fibers and found in the

35
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,509
walls of the heart and involuntary

36
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:36,030
cardiac winning of heart this is a

37
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,560
zoomed in view of how each of them look

38
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,299
this is what they would look like a

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,640
skeletal muscle on a microscope slide

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,590
and this kind of gives you a cartoon

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,728
kind of rendition of how that looks

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,640
highlighting some of the certain

43
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:49,349
features here's smooth muscle here's a

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,629
zoomed in version with that and then

45
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,599
cardiac being able to distinguish the

46
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:58,879
characteristics of all three and also

47
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:01,349
visually identify them would be advised

48
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,938
now I'm gonna go over a little a detail

49
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:05,188
of each of them and I have a video that

50
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,478
goes into each and even more detail so

51
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,519
first off skeletal muscle the quick

52
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,008
summary well they're long to their cells

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,860
with striations do these kind of lines

54
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:16,469
here number three here corresponds with

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,050
they're multi multiple nuclei meaning

56
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,060
there's multiple nuclei per cell here

57
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,590
the nuclei are embedded in the cell

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,909
membrane notice where they're located

59
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,460
and this is so they're just inside the

60
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,659
cell this type of tissue occurs in the

61
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,700
muscles that are attached to the

62
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,219
skeleton and skeletal muscles function

63
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,719
and voluntary movements of the body they

64
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:38,370
say their skeletal muscles are attached

65
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,729
to our skeleton the ones that were

66
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,069
choosing to control here another type is

67
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:46,829
smooth muscle their spindle shapes we

68
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:49,259
notice a definite shape change each cell

69
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,750
has a single nucleus and there are no

70
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:54,000
striations so see how they appear to be

71
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,650
smooth those striations those lines we

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,900
saw in the skeletal muscle are not

73
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,189
present here in the smooth muscle smooth

74
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,390
muscle acts and voluntary and

75
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,669
assumptions in the movement of

76
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,679
substances and illumines they are

77
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:07,619
primarily found in blood vessels walls

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,120
and walls of the digestive tract areas

79
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,879
that we don't consciously think about

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,349
moving what they move on their own and

81
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,699
they contract on their own in an

82
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:19,560
involuntary basis cardiac muscle these

83
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,719
branch off from each other rather than

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,699
remaining along each like the other

85
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,280
cells and the skeletal and smooth muscle

86
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,929
tissues they have striations as you see

87
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,180
here as we also saw in the skeletal

88
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,409
muscle there are junctions between

89
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,890
adjacent cells

90
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:37,620
that's this area's here each cell has a

91
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:40,889
single nucleus another characteristic of

92
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,230
cardiac muscles here striations single

93
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,488
nucleus in these connections this type

94
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:46,079
of tissue occurs in the walls of the

95
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,299
heart and the primary function is for

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,670
pumping blood this is also it in

97
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,900
voluntary action we don't think about

98
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:55,559
our heart beating we just can kind of

99
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,879
feel it the sliding filament model of

100
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,860
contraction again I have another video

101
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,650
it goes into this in more detail but

102
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,040
this is the basic overview here during

103
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,879
contractions myosin ratchets along actin

104
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,959
filaments compressing the I and H bands

105
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,239
what does that mean we have all these

106
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,759
bands and these lines and it's thick and

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,500
thin filaments well kind of you want to

108
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,079
think about is what's happening is we

109
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,329
have our filaments now neither of them

110
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,460
are thick or thin filaments are actin

111
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,889
our myosin are changing what's happening

112
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,449
is they're sliding so when we have a

113
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,550
contraction we're having

114
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,550
sliding the Z lines you think of my

115
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,009
areas here being Z lines they're being

116
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,110
pulled closer to one another and that's

117
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,000
what's happening here

118
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,180
during stretching this tension is

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,699
released in the IH bands expand so we

120
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,230
see here our relaxed phase it's our

121
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,120
muscle in the most relaxed phase you can

122
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,400
think about it like this where it's very

123
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,160
far as very too spaced out quite a bit

124
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,069
then in our contracted phase what

125
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,320
happens is they slide past one another

126
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:01,110
and they pull closer and that's our

127
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,579
contracted phase the AVN remains

128
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,240
constant throughout the length of the

129
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:10,649
myosin filaments does not change so if

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,840
you notice we compare our relaxed in our

131
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:15,539
contracted model we notice that the

132
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:18,179
length of the athlete didn't change the

133
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,910
length of the myosin didn't change but

134
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,220
the space between them our H band here

135
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,230
shrunk up considerably and that is

136
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,870
because we have those things sliding

137
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,970
together so we have our thick filaments

138
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,060
and our thin filaments again the thick

139
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,820
filaments correspond with myosin and our

140
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,519
thin films correspond with actin this is

141
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,379
how it would look in the real world here

142
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,719
and this kind of gives you a little bit

143
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:46,529
better of a picture of what's going on

144
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,510
this h zone here as it's being reduced

145
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,359
compressed when we have these two

146
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,319
filaments sliding against one another

147
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,879
hopefull is it's helpful and we view it

148
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,399
a little bit for this sliding filament

149
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,839
model contraction in a basic overview of

150
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,839
the muscular tissue types
