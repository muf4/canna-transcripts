1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,239
okay I'm gonna look at something we

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,500
probably take for granted it's how we

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:11,009
breathe so a very important component to

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,750
us breathing is the diaphragm now what

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,178
the diaphragm is is actually a

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,129
dome-shaped muscle I intended plays a

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,560
vital role in the breathing process we

8
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:21,000
could see here the diaphragm does it's

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,278
kind of this green line here not a

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,960
complete accurate depiction but it's a

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,759
line of change in volume so this is a

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,039
picture of that muscle and that kind of

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,618
increasing and changing in volume so

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,050
it's causing air to come in and air to

15
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,960
come out breathing is the act of pumping

16
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:38,699
of air in and out of the lungs so while

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,100
the diaphragm is completely separate

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,320
from the lungs is affecting the volume

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,950
of the lungs which is affecting the air

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,859
coming in or air leaving so the

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,750
inhalation and exhalation process when

22
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,670
we're breathing air in the diaphragm

23
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,500
contracts and flattens and you can see

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,620
here it's being pushed down taking our

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,480
lung volume and increasing it this chest

26
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,189
cavity expands downwards and also

27
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,338
outwards this creates a negative

28
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:08,429
pressure and air comes in so the

29
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:11,519
expiration or the exhalation process is

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,280
basically the opposite the diaphragm is

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,109
relaxing in this case volume of chest

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,689
cavity is decreasing and the pressure in

33
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:21,989
the lungs is forcing air out and that is

34
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:23,728
the exhalation process we can see it

35
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:27,239
represented here when we're looking at

36
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:30,000
the Boyles gas law is a key component

37
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:34,978
here and we have peak and pressure and

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,239
vehicles volume so p1 v1 equals p2 v2

39
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,688
well what does that kind of look like

40
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,688
well when the volume is decreasing our

41
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:44,938
pressure is increasing so here we have a

42
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:47,548
constant temperature and we have our

43
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,618
pressure increasing when our volume is

44
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,049
decreasing so we take our set volume

45
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,750
there and we're compressing it the

46
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,820
pressure is increasing so keep in mind

47
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,930
as the volume increases the pressure

48
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:03,148
decreases and you have this in verse

49
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,250
relationship as the volume decreases the

50
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,859
pressure will increase it's then linear

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,110
it's kind of this kind of this

52
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,469
exponential scale but you can see

53
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,160
overall the pattern is

54
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:18,469
the volume either increases the pressure

55
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,689
will do the opposite and here we see

56
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:23,389
that example of that volume decreasing

57
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:25,159
and that pressure increasing now the

58
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:28,009
mechanism of breathing in humans we have

59
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:30,139
typical breath at rest is about half a

60
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:32,509
liter so this is called your tidal

61
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:34,309
volume when each breath is completed the

62
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:35,870
lungs still contains a volume of air so

63
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,370
it's about one point two liters left

64
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,520
behind and that's called a residual

65
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,800
volume each inhalation adds about 500

66
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,750
milliliters at resting or 3,000

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,300
milliliters during exercising we were

68
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:50,419
three liters each exhalation removes the

69
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,250
same volume as inhalation added so does

70
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:55,099
this kind of relate to if you compare to

71
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,069
a two-liter bottle or $2,000 soda bottle

72
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:59,900
this kind of puts this in perspective

73
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,759
again your tidal volumes here and you

74
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,469
have its raishin volume expiration

75
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,969
volume and any residual line and there's

76
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:08,419
still some air in your lungs you can't

77
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:11,090
exhale at all so this gives you a little

78
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:13,629
bit of a background on how we go about

79
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,629
breathing
