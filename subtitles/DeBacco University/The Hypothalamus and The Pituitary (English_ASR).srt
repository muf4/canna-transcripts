1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
here we're gonna see how the

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,150
hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,799
linked together and how the nervous

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,929
system and endocrine system can work

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,138
together to help the body maintain

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,519
homeostasis so looking at how they're

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,309
linked well the hypothalamus is the

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,019
master nerve control center relate to

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,000
the nervous system and it receives

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,518
information from nerves around the body

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,439
about internal conditions it can release

12
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,868
some hormones and regulates the release

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,670
of hormones from the pituitary gland so

14
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,410
that it can it release some hormones it

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,079
can also help regulate what the

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,850
pituitary gland is releasing pituitary

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,429
glands conserve the master gland it's

18
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,320
part of the endocrine system it's roots

19
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,960
a broad range of hormones that regulate

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,399
other glands within the body we could

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,350
see exactly where they're located in the

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,808
brain here and here's our hypothalamus

23
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,160
and there's our pituitary gland again

24
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:51,659
looking a little bit more specifically

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,179
we see the hypothalamus which can

26
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,189
release some hormones but it's directly

27
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:59,219
kind of connected here to the pituitary

28
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:01,738
gland so the pituitary gland is located

29
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,600
in the bony recess in the brain below

30
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,239
the hypothalamus at this region right

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,489
here it's actually two glands a

32
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,368
prostitue 11 an anterior lobe and it

33
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:13,560
produces nine major hormones the

34
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,509
hypothalamus located up here secretes

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,030
hormones into capillaries that cause

36
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,540
pituitary to release or inhibit the

37
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:25,189
release of hormones so this hypothalamus

38
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:28,500
is helping regulate the pituitary gland

39
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:30,000
now the portal system that carries the

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,489
hormones from the hypothalamus to the

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,959
pituitary as we see here this kind of

42
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:38,368
connection between these two portions

43
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:42,269
located right the portion in the center

44
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:44,640
of the brain so when we're looking at

45
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,709
the role of the hypothalamus dÃ¡il almost

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,590
receives sensory information and relays

47
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,328
some to the hypothalamus so we're gonna

48
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,920
felassan our hypothalamus and the

49
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:55,169
hypothalamus and again there's that very

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,579
important pituitary when the

51
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,700
hypothalamus is responsible for

52
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:02,158
monitoring the body temperature pH and

53
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,439
various other conditions it will then

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,990
signals pituitary gland if conditions

55
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,969
need to be corrected so for example if

56
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,699
temperature got too warm or too cold or

57
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:13,620
if pH got too high or too low the

58
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,810
hypothalamus will be receiving that

59
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,420
and then telling the pituitary gland to

60
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,140
kind of help correct the situation as

61
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:25,889
needed so the role of the pituitary

62
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,598
gland itself it's the master gland that

63
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:29,098
signals other glands to produced at home

64
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,919
as a thing you need you can see a couple

65
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:34,828
examples right here the anterior lobe of

66
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,449
the pituitary side receives signals from

67
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,430
the hypothalamus and responds by sending

68
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:40,889
out appropriate hormones to other

69
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,400
endocrine glands the profs terior

70
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:47,309
portion of the pituitary receives

71
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,039
oxytocin or antidiuretic hormone ADH

72
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,799
from the hypothalamus and it relays them

73
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:55,318
to the body as necessary so you could

74
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:58,319
see in green the green arrows here these

75
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:01,199
are anterior pituitary hormones and then

76
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:04,229
pross teratomas are the two in purple

77
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,828
here both important and for the body to

78
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:10,768
help maintain homeostasis now the

79
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:12,750
control hypothesis pituitary is actually

80
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,969
called a negative feedback inhibition

81
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,489
it's regulated by hormones whose

82
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:19,829
secretions they stimulate so was this

83
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,919
means we have cold exposure with the

84
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:24,900
hypothalamus releasing hormones to the

85
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,530
anterior pituitary releasing a hormone

86
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,019
that then itself once released and found

87
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,889
in higher concentrations can itself

88
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:37,349
impact or reduce or stop the anterior

89
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,510
pituitary gland from producing so this

90
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:41,729
negative feedback loop I'll another

91
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:43,500
lecture on feedback loops it's just a

92
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,348
brief overview of the negative feedback

93
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,959
loop where this particular hormone can

94
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:51,869
negatively impact or reduce in this case

95
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,939
more Homer and being produced the whole

96
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,980
reason is once this is produced in high

97
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,049
amounts and completes the job that it

98
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:01,289
needs to wants to stop the body from

99
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,780
producing it wasting energy and to

100
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:05,878
prevent other body from having to re

101
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,669
regular those conditions in this case

102
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,858
this negative feedback is a efficient

103
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,169
way for the body to once it reaches

104
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:15,379
proper appropriate levels to maintain

105
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,379
homeostasis
