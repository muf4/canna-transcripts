1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
okay here we're gonna look at predator

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,250
prey interactions and while I did put

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,839
this image here on the title I'm not

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,699
quite sure how accurate it is but it

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,920
does get the point that the cat here is

6
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,449
the predator and the goldfish is the

7
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,269
prey and are interacting with their

8
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:17,698
environment so predation is a consuming

9
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,439
of one organism by another in under

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,330
simple laboratory conditions the

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,339
predator often exterminates its prey

12
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,858
however this does not typically occur in

13
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:28,710
nature so if our great blue herons ate

14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,900
all of the sunfish well soon there would

15
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,210
be no great blue herons gonna be no food

16
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,829
to feed off of our prey mantas consumed

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,239
all the Flies they've been a praying

18
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,549
mantis we need this predator-prey

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,099
interaction to occur and while they are

20
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,269
consuming other organisms you don't want

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,280
to consume them to the point of

22
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,250
extinction because they then they

23
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,960
themselves would become extinct so what

24
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,070
ends up happening is this interaction in

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,960
nature of predators and prey populations

26
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,920
often exhibit cyclical oscillations so

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,739
what does that mean well here we have

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,640
time here on the x-axis in population on

29
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:05,969
the Y looking at our North American

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,530
snowshoe hare and then here we have our

31
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,390
Canadian lynx which feeds on the

32
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,780
snowshoe here so snowshoe hare is the

33
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,890
prey well knows when the prey increases

34
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,259
which could be for a multitude of

35
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,659
reasons soon after that there's a delay

36
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,310
that predators will also increase in

37
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,710
contrast so that when the prey decreases

38
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,799
so will the Predators now prey can

39
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:28,589
increase for two different main reasons

40
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,240
one of food so the food availability to

41
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,340
the prey could increase these that would

42
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,259
be willow trees and brain and our birch

43
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,478
twigs that can help increase the food

44
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,489
supply and help increase the prey it

45
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,989
could also have a change in the predator

46
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,059
population in this case the canadian

47
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:44,250
lynx so here's the populations a little

48
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,079
bit lower the prey will increase however

49
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,359
this could be reduction in food or more

50
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,099
likely based on this data increase in

51
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,140
the amount of links to predator present

52
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,629
and you can see that delay occurring and

53
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,519
it decreases and we see the prey is

54
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,170
starting to increase and there's a delay

55
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,789
here and then predators will also

56
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,070
increase its this cichlid kind of

57
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,740
isolation that's currents up-and-down

58
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:07,559
motion that's occurring in the various

59
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:11,579
populations of the snowshoe hare in the

60
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,740
Canadian lynx now these interactions are

61
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,410
essential in the maintenance of species

62
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,240
diverse communities spreaders greatly

63
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,919
reduced competition exclusion by

64
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,240
reducing the individuals from competing

65
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,579
species for example sea stars

66
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,129
prevent by valves from dominating the

67
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,040
intertidal habitats other ordnance can

68
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:34,379
share this habitat so there's this term

69
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,120
called keystone species and these are

70
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,629
species that play a key role in their

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:44,069
communities so you see here that we have

72
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:46,799
a small amount of our sea stars they're

73
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:50,099
being eaten and consumed here by the

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,530
otters that's allowing kelp here to be

75
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,500
able to grow to be able to flourish and

76
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,879
be Creek this kind of habitat now in

77
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,710
this next situation we'll remove our

78
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,139
keystone species well for whatever

79
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:04,110
reason now this population is decreased

80
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:07,679
as we can see now there's a lot of sea

81
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,860
stars present that has severely reduced

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,980
our population of kelp that creates a

83
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,320
loss of habitat you can see these kelp

84
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:19,229
beds how extensive they're like forced

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,019
below the surface of the water here is

86
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:24,179
very sparse reducing of habitat for

87
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,000
small fish species to be able to survive

88
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,340
and really affecting the entire local

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,169
ecosystem here we're removing one

90
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,450
species now see stars multiply and they

91
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,789
feed on the kelp and reduce its ability

92
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:39,209
to grow and develop into these large

93
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:40,949
kelp forests so the term keystone

94
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,379
species is a way to remember it is the

95
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,839
keystone and an archway here is that

96
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:48,329
center stone so that's where it's insane

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,670
if we take that keystone out will the

98
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,770
entire arch will fall apart here we see

99
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:54,809
an example of a beaver another example

100
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,950
of a keystone species may develop in the

101
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,170
beaver dams

102
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:01,889
changing the water flows raising water

103
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:04,109
levels that can largely impact an

104
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:06,779
ecosystem it really changed if we remove

105
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,300
the Beavers can really change how this

106
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,460
local environment behaves and what's

107
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,460
allowed to survive it will sadly perish
