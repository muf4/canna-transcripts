1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,000
have you ever wondered what to look for

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,559
when going about purchasing cannabis

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,320
seeds well here at tobacco university

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,480
we're going to provide you with some

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
information that will get you beyond

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,880
just looking at potentially a flashy

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,359
package

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,600
and to try to look for being an informed

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,309
consumer when you go about purchasing

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:27,840
cannabis seeds

11
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:29,759
[Music]

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,278
all right let's get into the video here

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,280
to make an educated consumer when

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,600
purchasing cannabis seeds

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,719
well first off what do you look for when

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,840
purchasing seed well

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,520
ideally you want something that's got

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,480
more than just a picture you want to

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,640
find

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,479
seeds or seeds that provide you at least

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,719
with a germination percentage

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,959
emergence percentage ideally paperwork

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,120
uh coa certificate of authenticity

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
and you may also if you have the option

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,000
want to make a visual

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,359
inspection we'll go over what you should

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,679
be looking for

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,519
so first off germination keep in mind

29
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,799
that germination is a development of a

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,840
plant from a seed

31
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,640
or spore after a period of dormancy the

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
production

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,118
or of a initial root or radical is the

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,360
marking of germination

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,319
so in this these images all three of

36
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,959
these seeds have

37
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,639
germinated a lot of growers in think

38
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,679
it's an interchangeable term between

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,359
germination

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
and our next term emergence and it's not

41
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,438
the germination only

42
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,640
replies or refers to the seed's ability

43
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,000
to produce a root

44
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,239
and most of the time this is what seed

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,478
manufacturers will percentage-wise

46
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,359
will pro produce our print on their

47
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,078
label

48
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,280
what growers want really is emergence

49
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,000
because that's taking germination kind

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
of to the next

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,519
level emergence is an outgrowth from a

52
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,438
stem or leaf composed of epidermal and

53
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,959
sub-epidermal tissue the act of the

54
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,279
scene breaking through the soil and

55
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,078
unfurling its leaves is emergence

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,719
so all of these have emerged and that's

57
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:51,599
really what

58
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,959
we're thinking about remember

59
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,798
germination is just a production of the

60
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,158
root and not every c that produces a

61
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,479
root will be able to emerge

62
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,079
so keep in mind a high percentage

63
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,478
emergence is what you're looking for

64
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,718
and emergence will always be a smaller

65
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,478
percentage than germination

66
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,759
now that coa mentioned that certificate

67
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,758
of analysis

68
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
here when it comes to hemp cultivation

69
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,000
licensing a valid coa is

70
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,680
critical it's very important to have

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,439
this in hand and be to get this from

72
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,200
wherever you're purchasing your seed

73
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,878
coa is an official document outlining

74
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,958
the test results of a given product

75
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,878
in common for food chemicals and

76
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,878
pharmaceutical products as well

77
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,479
a coa can be performed either in-house

78
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,399
or by a third party as long as the

79
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,159
entity is licensed to do so

80
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
and typically a third party would be

81
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,239
advised

82
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
through specific hemp seed requirements

83
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,439
vary by location

84
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,439
a valid ca will meet most of the

85
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,878
conditions but be always wise to check

86
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,439
your local

87
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,799
area rules and requirements reputable

88
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,680
hemp seed banks will always have a

89
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
product ca

90
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,719
ready to view even potentially before

91
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,159
you purchase

92
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,400
the seed before you go through

93
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,280
purchasing it if you can't find it it is

94
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,080
definitely something

95
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,360
as a grower you should be requesting so

96
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,120
what does this coa

97
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,440
tell you you know why is it quote so

98
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
important well cya will list

99
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,039
all of the most common cannabinoids

100
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,280
found in the sample including delta 9

101
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:13,679
thc delta 8 thc thcv

102
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,318
thca cbda cbdv cbn cbna

103
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
and cbc just to name a few note that

104
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,199
delta 9 thc

105
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,518
is the distinguishing factor between

106
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,759
hemp and marijuana and that can be very

107
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840
important to at least have documentation

108
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,280
of what that level is expected to be

109
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,878
to determine if the sample meets the

110
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
criteria for hemp or marijuana

111
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,318
the delta 9 concentration is key it is

112
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,480
important

113
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,079
to make sure that you are planting

114
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,399
something that will keep you

115
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,080
within the requirements that your law

116
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,640
requires

117
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
so here's an example to coa here again

118
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,359
this is only just an example there's

119
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
many out there they might look slightly

120
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
different

121
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,840
but additionally a certificate of

122
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,798
analysis will list product contaminants

123
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
as well

124
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,280
so this includes microorganisms residual

125
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,598
solvents and chemicals and heavy metals

126
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,640
which hemp is notorious for collecting

127
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,318
from the soil

128
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,079
ideally each of these items should come

129
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,679
with a clear or nd

130
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
which stands for basically not

131
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,920
detectable stamp of approval

132
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,158
and this can go for both seeds as well

133
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,359
as purchasing any sort of plant material

134
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,359
as well

135
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,959
or dried flour so keep in mind this does

136
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,920
expand beyond just seeds

137
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,319
this is something you should be

138
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,120
requesting for for any sort of plant

139
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,680
product that you're

140
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,439
looking at purchasing now as i mentioned

141
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,478
that visual inspection what should you

142
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,240
be looking for

143
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,918
if you're getting a bunch of seeds well

144
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,840
this may typically happen after you

145
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,519
purchase seeds it can provide a general

146
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,719
idea of the seed grade that you actually

147
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,039
have received

148
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,560
so what do good seeds look like well in

149
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,639
our kind of example

150
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,560
pile of seeds here most of these would

151
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,079
be classified as good seeds at least

152
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,079
from a visual inspection

153
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,839
dark in coloration some of these kind of

154
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,560
darker spots on them are all good

155
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,000
signs of fully developed seeds seeds

156
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,319
that are light in coloration or have a

157
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,199
lot of green to them in their coloration

158
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,000
typically are poor grade seeds and as a

159
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,040
result we're going to have

160
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,639
a reduction in the percent germination

161
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,879
from these more fully developed seeds

162
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,879
lastly growers always ask well is a

163
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,639
bigger seed a better quality seed should

164
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,240
be looking at the size of the seed

165
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,079
note that cannabis seeds of fiber

166
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,038
cultures tend to be larger than those of

167
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,959
the drug strains

168
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,560
just in general comparison this can be

169
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,560
due in part to fiber-based plants having

170
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,199
greater history of being used for a food

171
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,519
source

172
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,520
rather than the drug-based drains so in

173
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,439
actuality the size of the seed

174
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,799
really is not necessarily a mark of the

175
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,719
quality more

176
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
of the kind of visual inspection and

177
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,080
that dark coloration with some of those

178
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
tiger stripes and those

179
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,000
dark spots and lines is a better

180
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,919
indication of higher quality

181
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
versus one that might be kind of a white

182
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,319
off color uh might be

183
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,879
light uh or kind of have a lot of green

184
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,439
to it

185
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,159
maybe a sign of an underdeveloped poor

186
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,918
quality

187
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280
seed so just keep that in mind when

188
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,719
you're going through implanting give

189
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,000
your seeds a good visual inspection and

190
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,000
make note of that

191
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,360
based on whoever you choose to purchase

192
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,360
your seeds from
