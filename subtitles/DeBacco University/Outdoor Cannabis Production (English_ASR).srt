1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,418
okay here we're going to explore a

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,640
little bit about outdoor cannabis

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,130
production we see a private image of

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,879
that here this canvas is being grown

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,099
outdoors

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,509
it can also be considered in raised beds

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,429
whether each in their own separate

8
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,589
container they're on pallets to help

9
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,910
drainage so with outdoor production

10
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:20,579
there's some similarities but there can

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,670
also be some variability and exactly how

12
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,320
a grower chooses to go about this so

13
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,330
first off in general outdoor production

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,099
offers the least overall cost to

15
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,839
actually produce the crop it's a very

16
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,488
efficient method of production because

17
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,039
there's no need for lights electricity

18
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,500
you can utilize natural soil and that

19
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,628
may only require amendments instead of

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,399
basically starting from scratch as some

21
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:44,039
indoor grow operations have to go

22
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,780
through and do factors to consider when

23
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,549
growing outdoors climate there's soil

24
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,890
there's pests and there's neighbors or

25
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,558
what we call promiscuous pollen that may

26
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,558
be in the area there so looking first at

27
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,000
climate the US Department of Agriculture

28
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,250
hardiness zone map is a great place to

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,109
start looking at your particular region

30
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,759
you have to realize there might be micro

31
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,400
climates this only gives you a general

32
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,009
idea of what to expect you can also see

33
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,680
in your coastal areas there are large

34
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,200
bodies of water there can be moderation

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,760
in those temperatures compared to those

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,759
that might be far away or at higher

37
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,280
elevation and this is why if you follow

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,019
this degree of latitude it may not

39
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,759
always match up so if you're kind of

40
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,039
looking here you can see there's a lot

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,478
of variability but the west coast being

42
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,640
much warmer and then that same your

43
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,469
vehicle attitude here in kind of the

44
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,269
middle part of the country and here in

45
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:34,670
the Rocky Mountains also a great degree

46
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:38,129
of variability

47
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,890
now canvas is not frost tolerant as a

48
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:43,319
result frost is 32 degrees Fahrenheit or

49
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,030
zero degrees Celsius and lower that will

50
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,188
kill cannabis plant it's important to

51
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,140
keep these frost concerns in mind early

52
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:51,209
and late in the season for growing

53
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,709
outdoors walls of water this is what

54
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,719
they look like they can be used early in

55
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,239
the season to protect young seedlings it

56
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,069
is very labor-intensive but it doesn't

57
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,679
require any you know heat to be added

58
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,718
these water tubes basically heat up with

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,060
the sun's energy and get back some of

60
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,949
that heat during the day there's a time

61
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,709
investment in the unpractical on very

62
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,449
large operations remade style covers are

63
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,920
best suited for long rows and access

64
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:17,988
kind of like a blanket to help

65
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:20,189
tender vegetation remember only a heater

66
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,750
heated greenhouse can help protect the

67
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:23,579
crop if temperatures drop below 30

68
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,020
degrees otherwise they'll get up in the

69
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,270
morning and they look kind of melted or

70
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,920
black or damaged so you don't want to

71
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,209
kind of rely on these structures to get

72
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,339
them through and start them too early

73
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,580
these would be great if you kind of that

74
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,469
one kind of oddly cold night in the

75
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,980
early part or late partner growing

76
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,199
season

77
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,818
now soil there's many different soil

78
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,818
types to consider Clay's santÃ© loam and

79
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:46,079
its main distinctions between those soil

80
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:48,149
testing is highly advised and

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,040
recommended both nutrients and texture

82
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,289
which can tell you a lot about a growing

83
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,090
site especially if it's in rented or new

84
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:56,068
field too you should also given that

85
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,539
idea if it's worth pursuing the location

86
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:59,818
if estimated cost to be too high to

87
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,979
amend it and we can make anything we

88
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,289
kind of need to but in order to get this

89
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,399
soil to kind of produce this it might be

90
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:10,318
cost prohibitive now to prepare the soil

91
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,030
the ideal times in the fall too a lot of

92
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,829
time for pH adjustments in particular if

93
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,909
it's necessary and give time for the

94
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,799
breakdown of amendments that may be

95
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:18,870
added so they can become plant available

96
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,340
in this frame still can be adjusted in

97
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,909
the spring but large changes need to

98
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,920
equilibrate over time which can limit

99
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:27,449
limit potential damage to the crop so

100
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,559
the earlier you can plan something that

101
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:30,869
really can have that soil test done

102
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,189
really earlier you can adjust that pH

103
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,620
the better your plant will be the

104
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:36,479
following season organic matter is

105
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,629
carbon-based components of soil you see

106
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:42,389
here being turned here's a chicken

107
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,340
manure and straw would be examples here

108
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,399
this often gets a lot of attention it

109
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,370
can be raised to very high levels with

110
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,049
excessive compost additions more is not

111
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,180
better necessary with organic matter

112
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,859
it's important for water holding

113
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,390
capacity but too much water holding

114
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:59,219
capacity and nutrients can cause more

115
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:00,779
harm than good people have been known to

116
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,389
burn their plants with excessive

117
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,949
additions of organic matter also it can

118
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,339
hold too much water in that area or

119
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,509
roots become waterlogged for a large

120
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,250
fuel application there's something

121
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:13,798
called a hard pan what this is the soil

122
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,060
compacted below the surface so if you

123
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,470
just kind of scratch the surface it

124
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,199
might be great but there could be this

125
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,030
hard hand layer located below that area

126
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,219
this can be an issue with where heavy

127
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,439
equipments being used can occur so it's

128
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,810
being worked when it was too wet or an

129
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,910
era been plowed excessively I

130
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,430
have that issue there of that hard plan

131
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,110
or that plow painful air but this is it

132
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,180
creates a layer that doesn't allow

133
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,310
natural percolation of water and Kanaly

134
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,930
impact root development so this is

135
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,339
something to be mindful of you're

136
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,319
looking at potential citement dig a hole

137
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:46,049
these penetrators or ways to kind of

138
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:49,230
assess the degree our presence of a hard

139
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,000
pan now raised bed growing again this is

140
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,610
still outdoor production raised bed is

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,860
an example of this the advantage is it

142
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,569
won't really quickly the plant is a hay

143
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,669
that's easier to work with in control

144
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:02,759
what goes in the actual box as far as

145
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:04,709
amendments or soil or adding vermiculite

146
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,750
or perlite or something else a special

147
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:08,668
mix if you want to add however the

148
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,259
negative effects with a raised band are

149
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:12,478
that so often often get too warm in the

150
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,639
summer as you can see here shade netting

151
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,189
has been used can increase irrigation

152
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,810
frequency the time and resources takes

153
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:20,668
to construct them and they're kind of

154
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,889
fixed in place once established not very

155
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:25,579
easy to move so if we have a well

156
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,590
established area by all means growing

157
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:31,379
growing beds or raised beds might be a

158
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:34,109
quality option for you but you do kind

159
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,029
of consider the pros and cons now

160
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,800
growing in the field err outdoor in

161
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:39,239
general typically weeds are a concern

162
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,460
and there's many options for weed

163
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,050
suppression you can use plastic which is

164
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:44,609
the easiest often the cheapest but the

165
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,780
end of the season disposal can be a

166
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,850
challenge or issue

167
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:49,409
there's biodegradable plastic Malta's

168
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,580
and that can reduce waste at the end of

169
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,410
the season

170
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,000
what's variable result with more field

171
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,710
trash than maybe wanted meaning there

172
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,930
could be particulate left at the end of

173
00:05:55,709 --> 00:06:00,089
the season there's natural which would

174
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,139
based can be expensive can also harbor

175
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:03,599
pests from year to year

176
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,728
I'll landscape fabric as we see here can

177
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,410
be very expensive initially but can last

178
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:10,349
for many seasons so it might be a good

179
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:13,229
option once you can afford or justify

180
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,220
the initial investment outdoor growing

181
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:15,439
just like other sites you need to

182
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,210
consider fertilizers and irrigation

183
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,240
typically drip irrigation is the only

184
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:23,159
feasible method for long distances

185
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,900
incorporating an injector such as the

186
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,150
dosatron or dose traumatic here is

187
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:30,228
recommended so you can also fertilize

188
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:33,269
the crop over a large area efficiently

189
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:35,550
wind protection strong winds can break

190
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:37,379
plants can also increase daily water

191
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,050
requirements the goal is not to stop the

192
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,149
wind entirely but to kind of break it up

193
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,949
privacy fence

194
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:45,379
is a good option and help kind of break

195
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,149
up some of that wind which is better

196
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,069
than the solid plastic or vinyl fence

197
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:50,569
this kind of creates areas where a lot

198
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,329
of pressure can occur or gonna get

199
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,560
swirling winds it can also damage plants

200
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,060
staking and trellising and supporting

201
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,910
plants can help reduce the potential for

202
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,160
wind damage when I shop for wild animals

203
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,350
you are growing outside the exam like

204
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,939
every animal including some humans we

205
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,830
want to investigate or harm your crop

206
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:08,449
consider fencing operations that either

207
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:11,359
have a physical metal fences this does

208
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:14,209
here or electrified up for potential

209
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,920
animals metal is a permanent fixture but

210
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:19,189
somebody else can climb over or dig

211
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,189
under it well down Fault in electrical

212
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,779
fence it needs to be kept clear of weeds

213
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:26,959
and so that power can be kept to it for

214
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:28,009
the entire season insects of concern

215
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,539
want to keep a careful eye out for

216
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,550
insects that may feed on your plants

217
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,410
some can also transmit diseases

218
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,770
I want to monitor plants and catch a

219
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,810
pest early some can be very small as we

220
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:40,759
see with reps and white flies and a

221
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,550
feeds who want to be really inspecting

222
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,930
your plants well lastly promiscuous

223
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,960
pollen you want to know thy neighbor

224
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,800
want to know if someone else is growing

225
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,629
plants that are growing for breeding

226
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,670
purposes or could be pollen in the area

227
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:54,230
their goal is not to pollinate cannabis

228
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,850
plants because you want your female

229
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,129
plants to produce cannabinoids and that

230
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,629
seeds and the weather and prevailing

231
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:02,149
winds may carry pollen a few feet to

232
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:03,920
even betting many miles you may want to

233
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,870
consider early early planting dates for

234
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,939
unintentional to prevent unintentional

235
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,230
pollination high months of moisture in

236
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:11,269
the air coming these pounds ability to

237
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,740
reach or pollinate a female flower this

238
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:14,629
is where our potential misting or

239
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,449
irrigation systems overhead irrigation

240
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:19,069
systems may come into play till reduce

241
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:22,909
the chance that your outdoor growing

242
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:24,829
field gets miss pollinated by a local

243
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,570
area that may be breeding this is also

244
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:27,919
important if you have a high tunnel that

245
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,569
you're rowing male plants for breeding

246
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,189
purposes you don't want to have that

247
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:33,500
pond go out into the field because it

248
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:37,960
will mess up the efficiency and

249
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,960
production of your entire field crop
