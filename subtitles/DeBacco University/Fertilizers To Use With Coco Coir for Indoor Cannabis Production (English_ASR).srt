1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
all right in this debaco university

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,240
video i'm gonna go over fertilizers to

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
use with coco coir for indoor cannabis

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,480
plant production

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,080
if you're choosing to grow in cocoa

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,440
choir you should be aware of certain

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,919
fertilizers to use

8
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:17,920
and in this video i'm gonna cover just

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
that

10
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,919
[Music]

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,598
so let's get into some of the specific

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,640
fertilizers to use if you're deciding to

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,518
grow your cannabis

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,160
in coco coir so first off cocoa has some

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,000
special

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,280
requirements and that's why you'll see

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,640
as we saw on the beginning slide

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,800
some companies specifically make

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,840
nutrient lines for those growing purely

20
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,119
in cocoa

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,800
when growing in cocoa choir there are

22
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,839
some special methods of fertilizing that

23
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,919
growers should be

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,960
keeping in mind while some companies

25
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,879
manufacture coco

26
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
car specific fertilizers growers need to

27
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,558
keep in mind a few key

28
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,198
items that you don't necessarily need to

29
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,759
go out and buy

30
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,280
that specific fertilizer others can work

31
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,198
but you need to be aware of

32
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,120
some unique requirements if you're

33
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,000
choosing to grow in coco acquire

34
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,640
so first off with coco coir in typically

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,879
growers

36
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,640
will be doing frequent feedings so

37
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,560
having a system that allows for easy

38
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,840
and consistent delivery of nutrients is

39
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,200
highly recommended

40
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
because cocoa core has some great

41
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,159
properties from a morphology or plant

42
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,159
structure standpoint

43
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,000
if you need to be irrigating quite a bit

44
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,400
usually daily it's usually good to mix

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,040
in some fertilizer with those frequent

46
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,478
irrigation events as well you don't want

47
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,920
to neglect the basic

48
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,759
macro nutrients you don't want to get

49
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,640
caught up in all the little details

50
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,400
you need to be aware that plants still

51
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,359
need to be fed the macronutrients the

52
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
nitrogen

53
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,560
phosphorus and potassium the npk

54
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,079
mentioned here

55
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,560
these could not be forgotten about to

56
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,798
avoid common nutrient deficiencies

57
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,399
so many times people who grow in coco

58
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,040
coir get caught up in the

59
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,239
purely the micronutrients or some of the

60
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,880
secondary nutrients

61
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,519
do not forget about the macronutrients

62
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,359
as well

63
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,039
and they'll be listed in any fertilizer

64
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,399
container or label

65
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,479
when growing cocoa choir put the

66
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,680
question here got calmag

67
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:00,879
if you're growing cocoa coir you need to

68
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
make sure you also have sufficient

69
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,959
calmag fertilizer on hand

70
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,000
many companies offer a calm bag product

71
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,239
but based on

72
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
personally collected tissue test results

73
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
the botanic cares

74
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
calmag plus gets my recommendation

75
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,480
though there are many

76
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,919
other options out there but i have used

77
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,759
the calmac i do have tissue tests that

78
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,839
confirm it will increase

79
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,199
plant levels of nutrients so that's the

80
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
one i choose to use

81
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,719
specifically and not sponsored by them

82
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,719
by any means

83
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,318
iron is also needed with coca-cola some

84
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,919
growth suggests that iron deficiency can

85
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,199
also occur with greater frequency with a

86
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,280
coca-cola substrate

87
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,359
while this may be possible calcium

88
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,159
magnesium deficiencies are usually more

89
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,160
common

90
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,680
also botanicare's calmac plus also has

91
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,759
iron in it so that's another

92
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,080
plus to be using that product in the

93
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,479
sense that it should cure any potential

94
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,160
deficiencies you would get by growing in

95
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,079
coco coir

96
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,359
well with any fertilizer so this is true

97
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,000
if you're growing coco coir

98
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,120
or anything when mixing any fertilizers

99
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,919
they should be initially mixed in a

100
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,239
clear jar

101
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,479
to see if any unexpected reactions are

102
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,000
what's called precipitation occurs

103
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,000
calcium-based fertilizers seem to be

104
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,519
more likely to react so if you are going

105
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
to be mixing other fertilizers please

106
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,200
follow the manufacturer's

107
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,719
suggestions and also perform a test

108
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,280
before you make an application to your

109
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,239
plants

110
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,158
to avoid any potential negative impacts

111
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,280
that could cause phytotoxicity or leaf

112
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,280
burn or anything like that

113
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,120
i want to do a little jar mix mix it up

114
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,400
ahead of time let it sit

115
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,000
make sure it stays mixed make sure you

116
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,200
don't get any participate that falls out

117
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,039
you can always check the ph

118
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,280
always good to see if it coagulates over

119
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,239
time with any fertilizer you're going to

120
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,719
be mixing

121
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
perform a jar test to make sure that if

122
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,840
you find any negative interaction make

123
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,878
sure they occur in the jar

124
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,878
and not on your plants
