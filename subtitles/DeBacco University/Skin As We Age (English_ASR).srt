1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,700
okay here we look at skin as we age this

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,230
kind of time-lapse shows kind of see the

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:13,109
progression of skin as we age and what

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,949
changes that occur you can see we start

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:20,160
young and youthful and slowly as we age

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,679
our skin becomes a less useful if that

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,099
less resilient a little more wrinkles

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,929
sadly develop and that's what happens as

9
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,679
we had written a little bit more about

10
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:34,259
this so first off skin as we age well

11
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,170
stratum basale is the mostly comprised

12
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:39,329
of keratinocytes these are responsible

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,059
for renewing this skin we're talking

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,160
down here in this deeper layer here

15
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:45,869
we're not talking right at the surface

16
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:47,729
these care in the sites produce keratin

17
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,578
as they mate as you may guess and this

18
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,288
is a protein that protects our skin from

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,750
chemical products and bacteria

20
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,670
now these migrated from the basal layer

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,100
up towards the skin's surface so this is

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,809
our skin surface and this is kind of

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,939
where they're being generated from and

24
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:05,250
again our orientation here's our dermal

25
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,780
layer here as we move upwards to the

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,978
skin surface they're dividing and

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,799
changing you'll notice since they

28
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:13,530
actually go these are younger cells and

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,868
these are our older cells and our dermis

30
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:21,450
cell turnover by age so as you get older

31
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,219
we notice that the cell turnover I'm an

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,680
infant is a 14 days you're getting cell

33
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,560
turnover - as you get older the amount

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,500
of days increases so infants and teens

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,439
you're talking about two weeks to three

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,578
weeks to four weeks about and as you get

37
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,219
older we're talking about forty five

38
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:41,429
eighty four days but much longer over a

39
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:44,429
month you're basically over the age of

40
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,320
40 and this is how our skin ages it's

41
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,299
generated down here we notice it's

42
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,429
changing and morphology and also

43
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,020
function as it works its way up towards

44
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,439
the surface before it eventually falls

45
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,459
off so again giving you that progression

46
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,889
as you age called

47
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,618
collagen production decreases and this

48
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,859
is reduces our skin's ability to repair

49
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:07,049
and it becomes less elastic see more of

50
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,659
a kind of a cartoon image here try more

51
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,700
of a real-world simulation here this

52
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,719
lost of that kind of elasticity of our

53
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,310
skin causes wrinkles

54
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,810
is because reduction of blood of blood

55
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,879
flow through the dermal capillaries

56
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,860
building in fewer nutrients well less

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,449
nutrients means less chance of renewal

58
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,030
less chance of rapid growth and division

59
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,979
this is the thinning of epidermis and

60
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,560
this is slowing the cell turnover rate

61
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:31,060
and reducing the barrier in function of

62
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,620
the epidermis

63
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,199
so the epidermis still provides

64
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,210
protection but as we age it starts to

65
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,959
provide less protection it's getting

66
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,950
thinner that barrier is becoming less

67
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,510
this gives you Indiana a little visual

68
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:46,750
representation and also some more

69
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:49,269
information on from your 20s to your 30s

70
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,699
or 40s to 50 plus at what kind of is

71
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,620
happening and progressing they draw your

72
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:55,599
attention just to kind of the shape you

73
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,150
could see in your twenties nice youthful

74
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,489
flat look to it 30s we're starting to

75
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,870
get a little bit of that movement here a

76
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,480
little bit of those wrinkles during the

77
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,539
form 40s a little bit worse you see 50

78
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:10,530
is more pronounced there and we have

79
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:12,909
this transition of reduction of collagen

80
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,580
and we have that seen a decrease in

81
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:17,289
moisture retention and slowing getting

82
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,080
that more kind of dry look that more

83
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:22,359
aged love those increasingly wrinkles so

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,540
not everything necessarily gets better

85
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,220
with age looking at the aging of the

86
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,739
skin to kind of give you some of these

87
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:32,259
major age-related changes that occurs in

88
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:34,539
a long list here sadly none of them

89
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:36,459
really great everything from injury and

90
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:39,359
infections to increase the immune system

91
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,080
starts to decrease sun protection

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,040
diminishes because again it's getting

93
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,810
thinner here and getting also drier skin

94
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,849
that's the last statistic to the skin

95
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,699
less resilience to the skin

96
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:54,969
he lost decreases it's slow to repair

97
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:56,859
and basically just showing harmful

98
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:59,709
effects of the environmental damage over

99
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,000
time so sadly again all not good things

100
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:05,289
that occur this is just one of your

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,680
body's abilities to provide a barrier

102
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:10,750
and again that decreases as you age just

103
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,849
couple fun facts here you shed the skin

104
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,949
cells continuously it's a couple facts

105
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:18,850
here human shed about a million dead

106
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:20,709
skin cells every 40 minutes so you

107
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,330
probably you know don't realize this

108
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,370
your number of skin cells that you're

109
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:27,250
shedding also the average person will

110
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,139
shed about 600 pounds to

111
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,569
seventy about kilograms of skin during

112
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,039
their lifetime so if you ever wonder

113
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:34,420
what you know you're dusting for and

114
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,730
what the dust bunnies are in the corner

115
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,530
of the room were down the hall that's

116
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,660
actually skin cells that's because

117
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,469
you're shedding so many of them so

118
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,570
rapidly

119
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,430
the more people you get in an area the

120
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:46,629
more life you die of those dust that

121
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,879
occurs and that's why I should go

122
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:50,350
through and make sure going through a

123
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,800
regularly including areas to remove

124
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:57,450
those skin cells that they were just a

125
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,449
normal body function of the shedding
