1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
so while we all may think chromatography

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,839
is all the same there's actually

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,080
different types of chromatography

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,440
describe some of those key ones here

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,559
what we see here in the image is

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,080
probably what we're most familiar with

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,359
it's a form of paper chromatography and

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,839
it's separating out plant

9
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,358
pigments so as i mentioned those

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,118
different types well what are they

11
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,480
chromatic in general can be classified

12
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,239
based on the type of mobile phase

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,679
stationary phase and supporting

14
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,358
material it could be liquid

15
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,439
chromatography gas chromatography or

16
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,439
supercritical chromatography

17
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,879
if you're using a supercritical fluid as

18
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,439
an example

19
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,159
so that liquid chromatography is an

20
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,839
analytical

21
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,679
chromatography technique used for

22
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,200
separating ions or molecules that are

23
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,640
dissolved in a solvent

24
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
it's commonly used for liquid solvents

25
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
such as a mobile phase and a column

26
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,759
composed of solid

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
beads which would be the stationary

28
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,399
phase and there's some

29
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,480
varying types with even within liquid or

30
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,280
lc chromatography you can see just one

31
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,759
example

32
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,920
here we have something called gas

33
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,519
chromatography and this is our gc

34
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,559
chromatography this is a technique

35
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,400
used to analyze the quantification of

36
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,599
volatile compounds this separates

37
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
volatilized samples

38
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,438
with a carrier a gas system mobile phase

39
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,240
and a column composed of a liquid or

40
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,478
solid beads

41
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,920
as the stationary phase so we're looking

42
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:14,640
at identifying certain volatile

43
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,439
compounds

44
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,960
paints uh gasoline for example gas

45
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,798
chromatography is something that can be

46
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,000
used for that in forensic science

47
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,680
paper chromatography is something you

48
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,719
might be familiar with something we may

49
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
have even done

50
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,319
this is an analytical method that's used

51
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,040
to separate out colored

52
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,879
chemicals and substances separates out

53
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,320
the dried liquid samples with a liquid

54
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,719
solvent the mobile phase

55
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,319
and paper strip is the stationary phase

56
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,319
you can see an example of that here

57
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,359
the beakers and then some even just

58
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,158
regular markers

59
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,519
and water for example thin layer

60
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,799
chromatography we're getting a little

61
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,599
bit more specific here

62
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,000
this is often called tlc chromatography

63
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,078
and this

64
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,640
is a technique to separate non-volatile

65
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,559
mixtures it can separate dried liquid

66
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,599
samples within a liquid solvent or

67
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,680
mobile phase

68
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,280
and a glass plate is covered with a thin

69
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
layer of silicone gel

70
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,799
as the stationary phase so getting a

71
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,438
little bit more specific

72
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,239
than our paper chromatography but again

73
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,038
still looking at

74
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,719
non-volatile mixtures those

75
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,238
classifications are based on the mobile

76
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,359
phase used we have the gas

77
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,280
chromatography we have the liquid

78
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
chromatography you can automate some of

79
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,598
these

80
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,840
or the type of mobile phase whether it's

81
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,318
a gas or liquid we have machines also

82
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
that can

83
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,878
allow for a very high degree of

84
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,878
precision and repeatability

85
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,318
classification based on that stationary

86
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,919
phase used well

87
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,598
name of the gc the gastroenterology

88
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,919
methods could be gas solid

89
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,199
chromatography gas liquid chromatography

90
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,878
bond phase

91
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,560
types of stationary phase that could be

92
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,799
used solid

93
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,400
liquid coated there's different types

94
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,000
that can be used and they'll be specific

95
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,000
for the materials you're trying to study
