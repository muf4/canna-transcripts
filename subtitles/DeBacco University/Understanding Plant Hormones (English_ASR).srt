00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,919
here i'm going to go over understanding

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,679
plant hormones in a general sense

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,679
not getting into specifics but providing

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,029
with an idea of kind of the

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,919
commonalities amongst all the plant

7
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:17,119
[Music]

8
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,079
hormones

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,439
[Music]

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,919
let's get into the understanding of

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,559
plant hormones here so first off in

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,080
general

13
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,679
plant hormones are regulators of almost

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,159
all aspects of plant development

15
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,358
and plant responses to their environment

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,520
they're active in very low

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,399
concentrations but have profound effects

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,000
on the plant

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,920
what that means basically is that it

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,558
doesn't take very much of any particular

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,520
home iron

22
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,320
to have a major impact on the plant that

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,079
we say

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,399
plant hormones are specifically

25
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,119
regulated and controlled which is very

26
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,200
important

27
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,558
simply because of the large impact they

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
have on the plant growth

29
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,640
and development this is for all stages

30
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,038
everything from germination

31
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,960
to pollination everything in between and

32
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,559
for all plants not necessarily just your

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,000
angiosperms

34
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,319
so hormones are important signal

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,879
molecule so just like in animals

36
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,359
same thing that hormones in plants are

37
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,319
also

38
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,799
very important and something not to be

39
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,719
kind of

40
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,240
understood well something not to be

41
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,840
taken for granted

42
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,679
plant hormones act as dedicated

43
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,200
signaling molecules plant hormones are

44
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,080
synthesized by the plant

45
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,118
and are transported some distances at

46
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,959
least one cell

47
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,640
diameter within the plant so this is

48
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,079
kind of that signaling molecule they

49
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,478
might be produced in one part of the

50
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,319
plant

51
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,560
but might have their effect in another

52
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,478
part these hormones have important and

53
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,920
very specific effects on the physiology

54
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,280
the growth and development

55
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,200
in vivo which is inside a living

56
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,879
organism of the plant

57
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
so it's because they're produced in one

58
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,078
area they're going to signal to other

59
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,199
portions of the plant

60
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,639
so this is very important for that those

61
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,118
cells to be able to signal

62
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,560
of to one another within the organism to

63
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,519
be able to get that

64
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,359
plant noticed effect now the plant

65
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,000
hormone cycle so these are just a couple

66
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,319
here

67
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,599
picked picked up kind of as a random

68
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,199
kind of graph here

69
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,798
again looking at specifics there's going

70
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
to be little differences that do occur

71
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,640
of course

72
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,799
but we're looking at basically the

73
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,639
hormone level and

74
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,480
basically four stages of the plant and

75
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,479
we could see that certain ones are very

76
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,840
active for the germination phase

77
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,119
and then the vegetative growth phase

78
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,878
they might be reduced and then they

79
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,360
might have peaks right before flowering

80
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,959
and then go down back down again for the

81
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
fruiting and ripening stages where

82
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,400
others might increase

83
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,439
so you can see that there's a lot of in

84
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,920
play a lot of flux

85
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,560
that occurs during the plant growth

86
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,199
cycle

87
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,199
on what hormones are active when and in

88
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,919
relation to what other hormones

89
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,598
ones might be active now the binding of

90
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,280
hormones so in a general sense

91
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,280
hormones act by binding to a specific

92
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
receptor remaining bound and not being

93
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,959
modified when acting

94
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,959
so we talked about earlier talked about

95
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,878
earlier that plate hormones

96
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,560
have a profound effect on the plants

97
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,199
however they're active in very small

98
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,719
amounts

99
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,479
how is it possible if something in small

100
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,878
amounts have a large effect

101
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,158
well what's happening is the hormone is

102
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,158
binding to a receptor

103
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,439
here's our plant here's our cell plant

104
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,639
cell because there's a cell wall here's

105
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,840
our receptor binding

106
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,399
and then there's a lot of relay

107
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,080
molecules a transduction pathway occurs

108
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,158
you can think of this as if we had a

109
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
pyramid of dominoes and we

110
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,199
knock one domino over we're having this

111
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,319
kind of transduction

112
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,839
pathway that is resulting in activation

113
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,919
potential of many different

114
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,598
pathways that's going to result in a

115
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,119
response an activation of cellular

116
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,359
responses both in this cell

117
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,439
as well as potentially neighboring cells

118
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
in that one hormone that one binding to

119
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,560
one receptor

120
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,080
can cause this amplified affected

121
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,799
response and this is why they can be

122
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,159
active

123
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,159
even though their concentrations might

124
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,000
be very very small

125
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,280
now when we're applying hormones to

126
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,959
plants this is something that's commonly

127
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,080
done for example over cloning adding

128
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,439
rooting hormone

129
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,440
spraying hormones in the plant can be

130
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,598
referred to as a dryness addition where

131
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,359
we're applying things to the outside of

132
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,119
the plant here we see a plant recently

133
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,680
potentially sprayed with water that is

134
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,759
being added extracellularly

135
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,920
the rates applied often do not match the

136
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,679
plant-produced levels as the goal is to

137
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,878
better understand plant response curves

138
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,159
at different levels

139
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,840
so just because the plant produces

140
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:06,878
hormones at a certain level or

141
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,400
concentration

142
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,919
growers may be applying them at

143
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,080
increased levels to help

144
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,158
increase the rate of that response which

145
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,200
may happen in some cases but remember we

146
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,959
over at certain hormones that can

147
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,798
actually have negative effects

148
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,478
studies can also investigate how the

149
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,279
same concentration of a hormone

150
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,959
may impact different species tissues and

151
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,559
development stages with the

152
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,198
intention of better understanding

153
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,800
hormone impacts the same hormone applied

154
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,478
at different stages of growth

155
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
could have potentially very different

156
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,719
effects as we saw with that graph

157
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
earlier

158
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,400
now there's some challenges with our

159
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,319
plant hormones

160
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,159
so most hormones can be synthesized and

161
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,360
degraded by many roots making them a

162
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,479
challenge to study it's not just

163
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,160
applying hormone x

164
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,240
and get response as you would

165
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
essentially with say a fertilizer

166
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,680
major problem when you apply them on the

167
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,199
extracellular basis uh in

168
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,560
androgenous levels with the levels

169
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,919
within the plant experiments are

170
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,639
difficult to establish

171
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,599
causative links between the hormone and

172
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,400
the response in

173
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,520
vivo and just as a reminder in vivo is

174
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,159
in the living organism

175
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,599
and in vitro is in glass so in vivo is

176
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,759
actually the organism

177
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,120
in vitro might be for example tissue

178
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,120
culture as we see here

179
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,879
just because we see it in tissue culture

180
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,319
doesn't necessarily mean that may

181
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,560
translate to kind of

182
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,399
out in a field application some studies

183
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,839
utilize inhibitors or mutants which are

184
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,279
called knockouts where they take that

185
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,439
gene and they knock it out

186
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,799
they prevent the plant from making it

187
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,240
and this aids in the study of certain

188
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
hormones impacts on plant development

189
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,680
what if the hormone was missing

190
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,720
how would that impact the plant so again

191
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,240
this is just kind of that general

192
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
overview of plant hormones you can see

193
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,759
why they're so hard to study

194
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,600
simply because of all the interactive

195
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,600
effects that might occur
