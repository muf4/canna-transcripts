1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
okay here I'm gonna go over a basic

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:06,899
sleep overview that hopefully you let

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,170
the experience after this video and not

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,309
during the video so let's get into it

5
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:13,019
first off there's different types of

6
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:14,369
sleep there's two major types there's

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,789
what they call non-rapid eye movement

8
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:20,519
which is an REM and rapid eye movement

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,340
which is abbreviated REM will pass

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,259
through four stages of n REM during the

11
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:28,500
first 30 to 45 minutes of sleep

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,150
an REM sleep occurs after the fourth and

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,549
REM stage has been achieved

14
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,829
now these different stages I'll go over

15
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,599
them in detail a little bit but it's

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,579
important to see it if you look at this

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,739
graph then we don't just go to one stage

18
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,239
and stay there the entire night we're

19
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,788
after cycling through different stages

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:48,869
multiple times potentially through even

21
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:51,149
just one night's rest now the importance

22
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:53,280
of sleep it's important that we get

23
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,340
enough sleep which does change based on

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,280
our age and I won't tell you what time

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,340
I'm recording this video but slow-wave

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,170
sleep is in is vital for restoring the

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,570
body's hormones and maintaining your

28
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,430
overall health this is why even if you

29
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,379
eat three meals a day it still can

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,570
become tired even in consuming energy

31
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:14,489
because your body's hormones are not in

32
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:17,279
the proper balance to maintain your

33
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:20,310
overall health those deprived of REM

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,719
sleep become Moody and depressed REM

35
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,420
sleep may actually be a reversed

36
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,650
learning process basically information

37
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,710
that you may have acquired throughout

38
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,509
the day is purged from the body you're

39
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:33,000
basically not putting that into

40
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,759
long-term memory storage daily sleep

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,590
requirements do decline with age with

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,900
newborns being there at a few months

43
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,390
requiring the most amount of sleep 14 to

44
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,280
17 hours in older adults those

45
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,259
classified at 65 years and older

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,060
requiring the least amount of sleep

47
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,769
suggested between 7 to 8 hours now those

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,200
different stages of sleep as I mentioned

49
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:57,868
we're looking at an EEG which is a kind

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,899
of a brainwave map the different stages

51
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,759
in the activity of the brain so stage 1

52
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,590
is introduction to sleep this is where

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,909
your eyes fight to stay open which you

54
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,310
may be experiencing there's watching

55
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,170
this video your muscles begin to relax

56
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,020
the physical word starts disappearing

57
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,859
around you this is stage 1 then we

58
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,110
progress the stage

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,840
- which is the beginning of sleep light

60
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,240
dreamless sleep my relaxation takes over

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,390
the body as it prepares for dreams that

62
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,400
are coming from stage - we progressed to

63
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:29,069
stage three and four are considered

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,680
slow-wave sleep this is considered the

65
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,449
deep sleep build up building up a

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,909
physical and mental energy

67
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:38,239
this is where the body gets its rest as

68
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:40,799
we see here the brainwave activity

69
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,290
lastly that REM or that rapid eye

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,180
movement is - dreaming this improves

71
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:47,759
brain function creates long-term

72
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,900
memories they see here and here's a

73
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,419
brain ladies again compared to that

74
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,760
awaked stage see here that awake stage

75
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,899
jumping around very intense see here

76
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,239
even though that there may be higher

77
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,550
peaks and valleys there's a greater it

78
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,490
stretched out over a better time huge

79
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:06,120
REM sleep here became the least amount

80
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:07,709
of brainwave activity now you might be

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,390
wondering how do whales and dolphins

82
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,680
sleep when they're kind of swimming in

83
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,899
the ocean here they still need to

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,270
breathe they are mammals well both

85
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,860
whales and dolphins only one brain

86
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,760
hemisphere falls asleep at a time

87
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,980
allowing them still to surface from the

88
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,590
water so that they can breathe so the

89
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,469
level rest the rest the left hemisphere

90
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,060
for a while and then transfer over and

91
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:32,250
then rest the right hemisphere while the

92
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,900
left hemisphere becomes awake this is so

93
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,259
they can also maintain that proper

94
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,390
hormone balance Lhasa here's some sleep

95
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,859
disorders narcolepsy is the lapse

96
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,319
turning abruptly into sleep from an

97
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,540
awake state insomnia is chronic

98
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,099
inability to obtain amount or quality of

99
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:52,620
sleep needed that could be because of

100
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:56,009
things that were doing keeping us up at

101
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,349
night kind of spilling over closer to

102
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:01,500
the morning than we may like at

103
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,620
narcolepsy here or maybe studying and

104
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,269
then all of a sudden just fall asleep

105
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,340
maybe on a microscope for example for

106
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,510
those taking biology and there's also

107
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,469
something you may have heard of called

108
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:12,780
sleep apnea

109
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:14,219
this is a temporary stopping of

110
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,889
breathing during sleep in this to be

111
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:19,949
because could occur because of a closure

112
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:23,459
in breathing passageways these are three

113
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,839
common types of sleep disorders you may

114
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,269
have heard about or maybe even

115
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,329
experienced a little bit of yourself

116
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,329
you
