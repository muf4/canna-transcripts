1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
in this tobacco university student

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,519
series video we're going to learn the

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,320
correct way to take a soil sample in

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,239
both a field as well as an indoor

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,000
application that's using a mineral based

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,480
soil and why it's important to go

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,480
through this process

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,600
[Music]

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,278
the reason that we would do a soil test

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,679
is because we need to know what's going

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,599
on in the soil before we actually plant

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,678
our plants this is because we want the

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,000
biggest yield possible and so we need to

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,719
know how to amend the soil properly

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,878
that's why we take a soil test so i have

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,960
a soil core here i'm going to want to

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,519
pick the area that you plan on growing

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,878
your plants in and try to dig it in six

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,879
to ten inches deep

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,558
once it's in there you're going to want

21
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:54,718
to spin the corer to take your sample

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,479
the reason we want it six to ten inches

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,480
deep is because that's where the roots

24
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,319
are most prevalent we get the best root

25
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,238
profile from that

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,478
once you're done spinning you take out

27
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,478
your corer you see we have the soil all

28
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,799
in there and dump it out into your

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:08,798
bucket

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,719
after that you're ready to take your

31
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,478
next sample

32
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,200
now how you go about determining where

33
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,118
that next sample is taken can play into

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,040
a little bit about knowing your field or

35
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,200
knowing your location so it can really

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,720
be as fine or as broad as you want if

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
the field history is known this can be

38
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,359
very helpful however when in doubt if

39
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,438
you're first sampling an area favor more

40
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,040
sections and if the results come back

41
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,719
similar you can merge those the next

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
time things you want to be considering

43
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,560
is like maybe an eroded area a lightly

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,920
colored soil and a darkly colored soil

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,000
this would be kind of like a broad way

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,519
to kind of segregate things here we're

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,359
looking at a little bit more of a detail

48
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,319
we're taking into account slope or fence

49
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,478
lines or manure added or a low spot so

50
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,478
you really can get quite detailed with

51
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,679
it if you want to go through and do that

52
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,319
now when you're going through and taking

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,560
those six to ten samples or more it

54
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,959
should be random but should also still

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,200
effectively cover the area minimum six

56
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,078
to ten would be taken depending on the

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,359
area

58
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,879
that you're looking as far as

59
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,560
determining that but this kind of when i

60
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,159
talk about random you know an efficient

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
way to walk through the field but

62
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,799
sampling from that location and repeat

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,080
the same process for your other uh

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,000
subdivisions within your sample site

65
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,520
now that we've taken all of our samples

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
out from the ground we're ready to send

67
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,000
it out to be tested so what you're going

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,000
to need is a labeled bag so that no one

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,159
gets confused either the scientists or

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,439
you when it gets back to you of what

71
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,280
soil it is

72
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,120
then you're going to want to take

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,000
roughly

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,239
two cups which is like two handfuls of

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,239
soil and put it into your bag

76
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,120
once you have that ready

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,519
just seal it off

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,080
get your paperwork ready and send it off

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,080
to the lab

80
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,518
all right we just saw the proper

81
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,598
procedure for soil sampling and outdoor

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,200
mineral based soil however i want to

83
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,518
remind you that if plants are growing in

84
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,518
cellulose media then the soilless media

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,920
extract sampling procedure and

86
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,439
specialized test should be conducted and

87
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,679
there's a separate video on debaco

88
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,878
university on that specifically now in

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,480
this operation that we're going to see

90
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,158
we're going to move indoors and we're

91
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,000
going to use a modified traditional soil

92
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,959
sampling technique because mineral based

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,120
soil was used it was a combination of

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,280
soil and compost with some rice holes on

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,719
the top so the basically the regular

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,719
soil sampling procedure could be

97
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,039
followed from mineral based soils with a

98
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,759
couple few modifications into smaller

99
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,239
colors using the trowel using six to ten

100
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,840
containers to make our final sample that

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,158
will be sent to the lab growing in

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,319
containers is different than a typical

103
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,158
field but the principles of soil

104
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,280
sampling when it's mineral based is

105
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,280
essentially the same

106
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,959
so this is how you take an indoor soil

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,959
sample obviously it's a little different

108
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,479
from taking an outdoor soil sample

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,400
because we are inside

110
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,479
we're growing out of a bucket we're

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,879
already irrigating and most of the time

112
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,598
we have amendments made like rice holes

113
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,639
to prevent bug breeding within the soil

114
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,000
so

115
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,079
you're going to want to move anything

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,199
obstructing the soil like the rice holes

117
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
out of the way

118
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,478
so you could clearly see the soil

119
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,120
take your trowel

120
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,680
and put it in about four inches deep i'd

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,199
say that's a good size for this bucket

122
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,439
then you're going to want to cut out an

123
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,840
area kind of just circle the trout

124
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,199
around until you have like a one inch

125
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,478
diameter to take out

126
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,919
now clearly it's going to be a little

127
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:38,959
more difficult since we're already

128
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,039
rooting

129
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,399
but it's still possible you just take

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,759
your hand grab the sample out of this

131
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,599
out of the bucket

132
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,360
now once you have your soil sample you

133
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,360
can put it into this bucket

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,720
once we have our two cups worth we're

135
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,639
ready to start sending it out to the lab

136
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,960
so we're going to need to take labeled

137
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,720
bags to put each of our soil samples in

138
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,000
so neither the scientist or we get

139
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,600
confused when testing the soil

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
you're going to want to take two cups

141
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,520
worth which is if you don't have a cup

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,680
about two

143
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,799
handfuls

144
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
and put it into the bag

145
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,800
now once you have about two cups worth

146
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,038
you're going to want to take your bag

147
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,879
seal it get your paperwork ready to go

148
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,079
and send it off to the lab to be tested

149
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,680
and for those that want to learn more

150
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,319
about soil testing there's some other

151
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,918
debaco university videos this one

152
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,079
provides a detailed look into soil

153
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,719
sampling with other tools and methods

154
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,038
included such as using a pvc pipe or

155
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,639
just a simple shovel

156
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,000
when that soil goes off to the lab if

157
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,079
you want to kind of see what it goes

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,519
through well the path of soil through a

159
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,758
testing lab you ever wonder what that

160
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,758
soil kind of goes through this shows the

161
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,439
full and complete process and then

162
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,960
lastly just another brief overview the

163
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,719
process with some other suggestions

164
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,959
provided so you're welcome to check out

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,160
these additional videos on soil sampling

166
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,079
because it's very important you get a

167
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,240
good sample to the lab so you get

168
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,560
