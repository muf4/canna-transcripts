1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,279
so for indoor canvas production

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,080
ventilation

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,960
is very important in here on debaco

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,800
university

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,160
we're going to break down and go over

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,600
some of the details

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:19,600
of ventilation

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,520
[Music]

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,160
let's get into ventilation's importance

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,839
in an indoor cannabis grow facility

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,278
well first off we need to consider both

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,240
the intake and

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,719
the exhaust so outline how air will

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,439
enter

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,879
and also exit the growing environment

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,599
it's important to think of

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,200
the entire path of air so that the two

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,359
systems are not competing

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,359
with one another and but instead working

20
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,119
together you know what one that's a

21
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,558
bringing air outlet a greater rate one

22
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,599
that's exhaustingly different

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,919
you want to make sure that these are

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,920
working in unison uh so you're not

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,679
having competing systems to allow for

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,600
efficiency of your airflow

27
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,159
now growth worms intake filters the goal

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,480
is to bring outside air in

29
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,439
so when we're having that intake area

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,159
we're having that outside air or

31
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,878
bringing it in

32
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,719
this can be passive but a pre-filter is

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
advised to ensure the prevent of

34
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,079
potential contaminants

35
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,079
from entering the grow space it's kind

36
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,239
of like the first line of defense

37
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,840
there and again the amount of intake the

38
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,199
type of intake filter can vary

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,960
but just having something doesn't allow

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,680
this air to passively come in even

41
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,478
though that is

42
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,479
technically an option these intake

43
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,319
filter options speed to be specific

44
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,079
hepa filters carbon filters or just

45
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,158
simply a physical screen

46
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,478
this works for large items such as bugs

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,240
or dust but the hepa and carbon filter

48
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,319
are more kind of to purify

49
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,078
the air not only to remove the larger

50
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,039
particulates but also some of those more

51
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,158
finer ones as well those hepa filters is

52
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
just an example

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,200
of one here called the dust shroom the

54
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,640
hippo filters can help remove dust smoke

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,520
mold bacteria pollen

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,239
other harmful volatile kind of

57
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,798
components

58
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,199
from the intake air the hepa filters are

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,280
made from tightly woven synthetic fibers

60
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,680
that are also washable to increase the

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,680
total usage life and that's a great

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
advantage to these hepa filters can

63
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,200
block out most airborne particles

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,878
down to 0.3 microns in size it's a very

65
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,000
small particle

66
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,878
now the intake if you're looking at

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,400
intake carbon filters carbon or charcoal

68
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:17,519
filters can reduce odors while still

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,360
maintaining a high

70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,360
flow through rate this makes them

71
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,480
commonly seen with exhaust fans in

72
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,080
sealed rooms

73
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,598
while you could use these for intake

74
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
because they're really meant to kind of

75
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,560
remove odors

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,080
not really the best for the intake more

77
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,039
suited for the exhaust

78
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,719
filters part of your system then we get

79
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,039
to simple just a physical screen

80
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,639
you know a physical barrier there these

81
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,759
are the simplest the least expensive

82
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,799
options and if you are going with the

83
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,079
passive system

84
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
you should at least have a physical

85
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,560
screen they're made from

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,680
a mesh bug screen that's based on the

87
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,239
size of the mesh will catch

88
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,800
insects of various sizes so keep that in

89
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,519
mind

90
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
what insects are you trying to exclude

91
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,560
in addition

92
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,318
for fine sized screens it's also

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,959
possible to filter out molds in mildews

94
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,039
but that's a very very fine mesh

95
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,719
the goal is to keep air cooled

96
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,679
reflectors and fans cleaned from

97
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,519
particulate

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,120
to kind of prevent the need to go

99
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,400
through and clean them nearly as often

100
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,158
it's easier sometimes to just change out

101
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,599
a filter or clean the filter

102
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,519
these are typically made from washable

103
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,919
materials with adjustable openings

104
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,680
to ensure an easy fit for a variety of

105
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,079
applications

106
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,959
then we have the exhaust filters in our

107
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
grow space

108
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,479
so these ideally clean air is assumed to

109
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,479
be in the grow space

110
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,238
so when it comes to the exhaust filters

111
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,158
the only item that typically needs to be

112
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,719
removed is odors

113
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,280
this is why hepa and physical screen

114
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,120
filters

115
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,280
are only used at the intake of a grow

116
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,640
space not in the exhaust

117
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,318
so it's being mindful of where you're

118
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,000
going to place what filter

119
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,359
for exhaust filters the carpenter

120
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
charcoal filters are usually the

121
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,400
standard choice as we see

122
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,239
here pulling air through and they're

123
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,200
going to be exhausted out of the grow

124
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,519
tent

125
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,119
now there's some exhaust filter options

126
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
so pretty much your

127
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,200
carbon exhaust filters or inline carbon

128
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,560
filters would be advised

129
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,318
to be used in this particular situation

130
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,920
now the carbon exhaust filters we see

131
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,679
one example right here

132
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,280
activated carbon filter is often an

133
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,400
efficient way to capture most of those

134
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,840
volatile

135
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,719
carbons compounds within that fine

136
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,439
carbon

137
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,279
particulate but those fine carbon can

138
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,040
due to their high surface area can also

139
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,519
filter out gases and odors

140
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,360
from the air they should be used with a

141
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,879
fan as part of the ventilation system

142
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,400
for maximum effectiveness

143
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,159
meaning you do not want to just simply

144
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,719
have them passively

145
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,479
exhausting air out the carbon itself

146
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
absorbs the air contaminants

147
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,519
due to the fine pore structure that

148
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
allows for efficient capture of

149
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,319
materials

150
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,000
while still maintaining good airflow

151
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,319
that is important to the area the

152
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,680
growing area for the cooling purposes

153
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,918
so again you're kind of getting the best

154
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,000
of both right there

155
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,279
now our inline carbon filters operate

156
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,519
with basically the same

157
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,039
material but inline carbon filters make

158
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,680
it easy for installation

159
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
in typical ducting cooling systems they

160
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,918
offer the same benefits of the common

161
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,680
end

162
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,319
or start ventilation systems as we saw

163
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,319
in our last picture two slides ago

164
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,439
they're commonly used in grow tents

165
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,879
air-cooled lighting

166
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,360
areas where air is being transferred

167
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,478
through ducting from one area to another

168
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,319
however just keep in mind their

169
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,439
efficiency tends to be a little bit less

170
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,759
so you may have to have a little bit

171
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,759
larger fan or a little bit higher

172
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,520
movement of air to make these work

173
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,960
effectively

174
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,279
and you also do not want to forget in

175
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,279
general about the ducting itself

176
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,359
so there's also ducting and there's also

177
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,319
pre-filters of very important

178
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,879
components to a ventilation system for

179
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,478
the air ducting options we have

180
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,079
non-insulated which is the most common

181
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,000
lease as we see down here

182
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,758
and then there's also insulated ducting

183
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,519
options these are typically used when

184
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,840
trying to reduce temperature changes

185
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,560
from

186
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,000
air transport for example if intake air

187
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,759
has been cooled before entering the grow

188
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,199
space where to keep it cool

189
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,879
both serve the same purpose of

190
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,439
transporting air from one area to

191
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,759
another

192
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,879
in a controlled pathway so one's not

193
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,240
better than the other

194
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,918
but if you're looking at having a

195
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,360
difference in temperature you might want

196
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,359
to go with that insulated

197
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,120
ducting option and then there's also

198
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,639
lastly here pre-filters

199
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,560
so pre-filters are a great cheap and

200
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,160
easy way to extend the life of other

201
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,918
more expensive and harder to find

202
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,199
replacement filters they're most

203
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,799
commonly used with

204
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,478
carbon filters so the point that they

205
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
usually come with the carbon filter you

206
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,800
might be purchasing

207
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,479
pre-filters act as a physical barrier to

208
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
particles before they have a chance to

209
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,599
reach the main filter

210
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,758
with the goal to extend the life of the

211
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
main filter also what's great about that

212
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,759
is

213
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,038
they're easily removed can be washed and

214
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,479
then reinstalled

215
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,159
always a good idea to have an extra one

216
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:34,639
on hand but a lot of times it's not

217
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
needed

218
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
you can just go through and wash these

219
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,800
and again their goal is to catch those

220
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,800
big particulates

221
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,960
to extend the life of that finer mesh in

222
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,478
this case of your carbon filter

223
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,560
so hopefully this helps you understand

224
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,038
your ventilation system and ensure that

225
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,199
you're

226
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,199
operating it at the maximum efficiency
