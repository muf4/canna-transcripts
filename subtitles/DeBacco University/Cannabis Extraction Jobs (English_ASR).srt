1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
so in part what makes cannabis such a

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,839
unique plant is here there's a job that

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,120
has nothing to do with the actual

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,440
production of the plant

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,638
but is still very important and that's

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,879
the process of

7
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,119
extraction so if you want to learn more

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,359
about what's involved with cannabis

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,960
extraction continue to watch this

[Music]

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,198
all right let's get into the

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,359
all-important job of extraction when it

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,239
comes to cannabis producing that final

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,439
purified

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,640
end product so first off the general job

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,399
description

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,480
the laboratory director is responsible

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,799
for engineering cps's cannabinoid

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,279
extraction efficiency and tracking

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,799
programs developing product sets and

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,160
continually creating efficient and

23
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,558
repeatable methods

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,078
for product production i want to ensure

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,439
that whatever we're doing is able to

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,719
produce while it may look like a goopy

27
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,519
substance in the end

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,280
is very repeatable this laboratory

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,960
director in the attraction room this

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,760
also develops implements

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,719
oversees the extraction purification and

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,118
formulation

33
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,560
of cannabinoid-based compounds they're

34
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,319
all about how do they isolate

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,079
one particular compound one particular

36
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,039
molecule from might be a

37
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,239
great mixture of molecules the

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,040
day-to-day activities

39
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,798
of an extractor is looking at ensuring

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
laboratory meets appropriate safety and

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,680
security standards

42
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,679
and some could be very simple some could

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,200
be very large operations

44
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,118
they're going to also direct the

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,159
extraction purification laboratories

46
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,078
within the company

47
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
and that will depend on the size

48
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,879
interact with suppliers for purchasing

49
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
equipment components

50
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,839
soils as well as amendments they're also

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,239
responsible for developing new products

52
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,759
to meet the demands of the market

53
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,759
and they communicate with third-party

54
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
testing laboratory for product release

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,478
testing

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,079
product shelf life studies and new

57
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,200
product characterization so there's a

58
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,679
lot involved

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,680
with those isolation processes they

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,439
supervise staff working in extraction

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,520
purification laboratories

62
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,879
as well as kind of looking through and

63
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,798
developing

64
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,519
those protocols and refining those

65
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,039
protocols on a day-to-day basis

66
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,639
now the qualities that a person must

67
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,279
have if you're looking at pursuing

68
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,878
um extraction is experiencing working

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,199
with extraction and purification of

70
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,959
botanical products for human use

71
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,280
very special skill set involved with

72
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,319
this so i want to have at least some

73
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,919
experience with this a working knowledge

74
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,519
of good manufacturing practices the

75
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,280
statistical processes

76
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,040
and the six sigma production

77
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,159
methodologies why because you're working

78
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,120
in such a stringent

79
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,159
area want to be very controlled and

80
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,439
directed with

81
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,959
your day-to-day processes proficient in

82
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,719
quality management systems

83
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,159
you want a working knowledge of human

84
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,598
drug production regulations

85
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,519
as well as industry standards to know

86
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,039
what to produce advanced

87
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,000
science degree 10 plus years of

88
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,919
experience in the cannabis

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,759
pharmaceutical industries involved

90
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,518
are required in some facilities

91
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,639
particularly those higher end

92
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,599
facilities so um this is a very detailed

93
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,759
process

94
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,959
can learn it you know throughout the you

95
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,000
know some of the processes at some of

96
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,759
the smaller

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,199
areas but when we get into the larger

98
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,000
scale production

99
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,119
very small room for any potential error

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,360
there

101
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,158
now connection to cannabis industry in

102
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,400
general

103
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,079
is that the chemist extraction jobs are

104
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,039
a necessary step in the future of the

105
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,040
industry

106
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,439
new extraction methods are continuously

107
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,679
being tested to increase efficiency

108
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,359
of extraction many consumers prefer

109
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
extracts over flour

110
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
as we push forward into the future the

111
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
extract industry will only get larger

112
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,878
so some are still about the dry flour

113
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,840
but a lot of people getting into the

114
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,239
oils

115
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,439
the crumbles shatters things like that

116
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,319
so as a result

117
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,680
there's gonna be a greater demand for

118
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
jobs with an extraction

119
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,040
for cannabis and being sure you're

120
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,599
dialed in to produce a

121
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,239
high quality final extract is going to

122
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,039
become

123
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,000
very sought after even more so than is

124
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,000
today
