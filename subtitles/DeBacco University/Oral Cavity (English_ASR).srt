1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,958
okay here we're gonna learn a little bit

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,759
more about the oral cavity looking at

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,919
some of the details that occur in our

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,309
mouth in relation to the digestive

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,029
system starting with functions of the

6
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:13,709
oral cavity

7
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:16,469
well there's sensory analysis of natira

8
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,570
before swallowing recognition kind of

9
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:19,829
determining texture mechanical

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,219
processing which occurs through the

11
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:25,618
teeth and the surfaces in the oral

12
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,660
cavity lubrication is occurring with

13
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,000
mucus and salary' gland secretions and

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,710
there's some digestion it's limited but

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,719
mainly carbohydrates and some lipids

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,759
salivary amylase is one of the key

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,280
enzymes it's produced and that is

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,369
starting the breakdown of carbohydrates

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,750
you ever had a cracker I'm just kind of

20
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:44,250
kept it in your mouth eventually it kind

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,350
of break down turn into mush and

22
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,420
ultimately liquid we did the same thing

23
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,429
with like a piece of gum or something

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,460
high in fats that same process will not

25
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:55,289
happen because you only have enzymes

26
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,620
specific to carbohydrates and some

27
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,910
minimal on lipids now breaking down the

28
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,669
food in the mouth many variants have

29
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,438
teeth that allow for chewing

30
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,689
massification of the food now we're

31
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,000
going to see a carnivore or herbivore in

32
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:11,819
an omnivore looking at incisors canines

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,219
premolars and molars all color-coded

34
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,929
appropriately here in the carnivore

35
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,150
there's a only eat meat see the

36
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,400
noticeable designers and the canines are

37
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,590
very pronounced here at the example of

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,290
our Tiger timers a pointed teeth they're

39
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,759
adapted for cutting and shearing

40
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,430
herbivores those plant eaters such as

41
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,909
the deer those have flat teeth here's

42
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,530
your molars and our premolars wilson for

43
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,210
grinding of plant cellulose help to kind

44
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,939
of mechanically break down the very

45
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,469
complex elyes also notice their incisors

46
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:42,599
and canines are in very small amount

47
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,950
here it's actually kind of a gap here in

48
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,769
their teeth so you have a lot of the

49
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,950
premolars and molars for that break down

50
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:51,539
then are omnivores these have kind of

51
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,219
the teeth of the carnivores in the front

52
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,350
and kind of also the teeth of the

53
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,709
herbivores in the back to allow them to

54
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:00,839
eat both meat and plant materials and be

55
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:04,078
able to efficiently break them down from

56
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,390
the mechanical process continuing on to

57
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,349
the tongue on the superior surface of

58
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,989
the tongue actually bears three

59
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,848
different types of Hawaii we have the

60
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,500
Philly form which is to give the tongue

61
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:15,869
the roughness and provide

62
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,490
friction kind of what friction in the

63
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,370
tongue so you can be able to move that

64
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,659
food around thumb the form is scattered

65
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,219
widely over the tongue and give it that

66
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:28,379
reddish kind of hue as we see here

67
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:30,539
circum of the left is the v-shape row in

68
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:32,280
the back of the tongue and it's kind of

69
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,949
waiting towards the back section there

70
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,590
and then our sulcus terminalis is the

71
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:41,099
groove here that separates the tongue

72
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,870
into two areas we see the anterior 2/3

73
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,719
residing in the oral cavity and the

74
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,120
prostitute here residing in the oral

75
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,530
Phoenix

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,629
farik's which is important when we're

77
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,909
starting to ingest our food as it begins

78
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,370
its way or its path through the

79
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:57,810
digestive system in the mouth the tongue

80
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,450
mixes the food and solution called

81
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,610
saliva the saliva license and lubricates

82
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:03,989
the food contains amylase which remember

83
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,480
is an enzyme it's important for the

84
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,430
breakdown of starch starch is a

85
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,560
collection here of glucose molecules all

86
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,719
them together hey Lois here's considered

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,060
like that starts clipper breaking down a

88
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,219
disaccharide apply polysaccharide

89
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,590
Astellas could be maltose and the

90
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,379
monosaccharide of maltose would be

91
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,150
glucose disaccharide leading to glucose

92
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,310
is learned together

93
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,110
- decorating one here see you again Paul

94
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,209
II died and monosaccharides amylase

95
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,500
breaking down our starch multi is

96
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,989
breaking down our maltose

97
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,569
so remember ASE at the end important for

98
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,280
identifying potential enzymes in the

99
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,019
mouth our celery glands are controlled

100
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,449
by the nervous system to see where

101
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,939
they're located right here continuous

102
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:47,189
secretion of about 0.5 milliliters per

103
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,449
minute keeps the mouth moist and in the

104
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:50,579
presence of food this triggers an

105
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:52,169
increase in the secretion rate the

106
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,670
reason why I might want to increase in

107
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:56,129
secretion rate Maivia to lubricate the

108
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,289
food as it starts to enter the digestive

109
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,299
system we also want an increased number

110
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:02,060
of enzymes that start breaking down some

111
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,830
of those carbohydrates

112
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,300
lastly the bolus as a bollock mixture of

113
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,190
food and saliva that forms in the mouth

114
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,959
during the process of chewing we have

115
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:12,629
that bolus forming if that's gonna be

116
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,310
turned ultimately into time and that

117
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,319
time will be broken down into nutrients

118
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,418
which will be absorbed and all the

119
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,879
leftover material will be excreted from

120
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,199
the body in the form of feces once the

121
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,870
bullet roots of the stomach and mixed

122
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,719
with the gastric juices becomes kind so

123
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,160
keep in mind it's kind of the same

124
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,810
collection of food but depending where

125
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,970
it's located what it's mixed with that

126
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,589
will change its name so if you're

127
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,230
looking for identifying certain areas

128
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:40,019
that same thing that was called a bolus

129
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,060
up here we call kind once it reaches the

130
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,219
stomach and mixes of gastric juices

131
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,870
further digestion and absorption and

132
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,620
eventually will be discharged again as

133
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,620
feces
