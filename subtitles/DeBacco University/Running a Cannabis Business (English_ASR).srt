59
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,759
of a job title

60
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,118
well typically a master's degree in

61
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,000
business administration

62
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,359
finance or organizational development is

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,959
recommended

00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,560
experience in leadership positions

65
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,559
because it is high stress

66
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
excellent communication skills ability

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
to work independently as well as with

68
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,560
others

of

74
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,598
duties and a drive in motivation because

75
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
you have to be kind of self-propelled

76
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,000
because there's gonna be a lot of

77
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,680
pressure i need to persevere to work

78
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
through some of the challenges

79
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,760
is going to be a great quality to

80
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,959
possess and have

81
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,120
now the connection of the cannabis

82
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,280
industry is the ceo

83
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
is the face of the company and overall

84
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
can decide how the company runs and

85
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,039
operates at the highest level

86
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
the ceo sets ethical standards for the

87
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,799
company creates goals for the company to

88
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,719
achieve and keeps the company

89
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,160
at a competitive spot within the

90
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,439
industry and what can make this

91
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,719
challenging is the industry can

92
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,639
constantly be changing

93
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,159
so it's the ceo's job to change with it

94
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,238
stay ahead of that change

95
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,759
invest where they need to invest to keep

96
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,519
