1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,878
here we look at the plant hormone group

2
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:07,949
breast no steroids this is one general

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:09,660
category that there's may not fall under

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,019
this so I'm gonna speak in generalities

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,609
here so Bosco steroids are groups of

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,469
some 40 different steroids that are

7
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,570
synthesized by plants and our potent

8
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,698
horns affecting many aspects of cramp

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,050
plant growth again there's 40 of them

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,539
this is just speaking to what this

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,368
general category does these hormones act

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,349
synergistically or at least additively

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,570
with several other hormones such as oxen

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,730
and gibberellins for example however

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,899
what's unique about these breasts no

16
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,718
steroids is if they're far more

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,120
important pulley than other hormones

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,250
they act in far lower concentrations

19
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,109
than the others so while all hormones

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,420
act in very small amounts

21
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,969
these can AskMe even smaller amounts to

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,469
get the same effect in the end that's an

23
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,640
example why of the Hot Sauce here I

24
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,160
think of them being very concentrated

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,579
and a little amount of these can go a

26
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,019
long way and having a plant effect so

27
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,910
what do they do though they promote cell

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,559
expansion and cell elongation and they

29
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,009
work with oxen to be accomplished that

30
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,840
they also promote vascular

31
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,540
differentiation which is an example here

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,820
where we see xylem and phloem is the

33
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,600
smaller areas here these rasmus steroids

34
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,829
are involved with that separation in

35
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:18,509
specialization of our xylem the large

36
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:20,519
Rowling's here and the phloem the

37
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,530
smaller ones here this is important for

38
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,329
the vascular system of the plant they're

39
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,000
also for evolved with tall and

40
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:30,150
elongation and for pollen tube formation

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,150
so very important in the plants ability

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,210
to potentially have a successful

43
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,920
pollination process in addition they

44
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,599
have the ability to improve the quantity

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,280
and quality of horticultural crops

46
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,919
protect plants against many

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,049
environmental stresses so advancements

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,359
are using these the hope is that these

49
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,040
brass ana steroids these be ours in the

50
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:52,319
production of horticultural crops become

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,360
a more practical and hopeful strategy

52
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,158
for improving crop yields and success

53
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,560
what does that mean well under normal

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,030
conditions if we have a stressor that's

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,060
going to reduce the plant performance

56
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,070
however potentially with the use of this

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,439
particular hormone we could still have

58
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,449
those stressors and increase the

59
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,430
performance of the plant this is why

60
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,659
they've gained popularity due to the

61
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,340
ever increasing amounts of

62
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:19,240
environmental stresses plants are under

63
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,189
and the ever demands by growers to

64
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,350
maintain consistent plant performance in

65
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:26,829
yield and these forms could be one way

66
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:30,479
to help mitigate the negative impacts of

67
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,480
stressors to plants
