1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,000
now on this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,919
we're going to go over some testing

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,359
cannabis plants potency

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,960
and kind of looking at the debate

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,440
whether we should be providing

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,639
a number or a range when we're looking

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:17,920
at potency

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,919
related to cannabis

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:24,879
[Music]

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,839
now it is important to test cannabis for

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,198
its potency

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,480
we're looking at more of an analytical

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,000
report and kind of this kind of

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,799
coloration difference because it can be

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,159
difficult to determine well is this uh

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,879
where does this exactly fall what

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,718
percentage

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
so we'll look at this in more detail

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,439
however looking at the general trends

20
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,679
of potency of cannabis samples

21
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,519
percentage thc and cbd in cannabis

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,359
samples seized by the

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,199
da from 1995 to 2019

24
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,079
and we can see that there is generally a

25
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,799
trend of an increase in thc

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,840
and overall generally a decrease here in

27
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,558
cbd

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,120
percentage of those seized by the dea

29
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,198
from

30
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,878
environmental agencies now when we're

31
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,399
looking at the percentages here these

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
are ones that are seized on the street

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,240
we are seeing some of course medical

34
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,679
benefits from the cbd

35
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,319
but the fact that it may lack that

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,118
psychoactive high may make it less of

37
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,559
a street desirable end product so

38
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,920
looking at this research article here

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,759
and again brief summary will only be

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
provided but the role of nasa spec

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,400
looking at

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,799
the cannabis industry to get some of

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,280
this detail of testing

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,400
so there's five cannabinoids here

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,799
presented

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
and in canvas potency typically refers

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,118
to the percentage of thc

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,840
and or the cbd cannabidiol in the plant

49
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:39,519
material

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
however at least three other

51
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,399
cannabinoids are between

52
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:47,438
routinely monitored including thca cbda

53
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,519
and cbn so just remember that there are

54
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,118
more than just the thc in the cbd

55
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,798
that tends to get a lot of the highlight

56
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,200
or the attention

57
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,799
so companies may offer a mini test

58
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,880
actually this is a good thing

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
while the main interest is typically the

60
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,039
cannabinoids and terpenes remember

61
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,718
the contaminant testing is required and

62
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,118
the product needs to pass

63
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,199
all of those categories as well so i'm

64
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,239
just caught up in oh looking at thc cbd

65
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,919
and cannabinoids

66
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,680
uh maybe some terpenes we're also

67
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,439
looking at kind of passing

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,280
all of the contaminant testing such as

69
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,439
heavy metal testing mycotoxin testing

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,360
microbial analysis and so on

71
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,359
also when we're looking at cannabinoids

72
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
it's more than just thc and cbd there's

73
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,800
a list here

74
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,080
of what some companies will test for so

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,319
it's good to have that

76
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,680
full kind of understanding of all the

77
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,639
cannabinoids present

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
in that final plant material now sample

79
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,439
size

80
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,799
does vary so depending on what end

81
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,639
product is being tested

82
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,840
will require a different amount of a

83
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,279
minimum sample

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
keep in mind that the number of tests

85
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,719
performed should correlate with the size

86
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,160
total lot size of the product produced

87
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,519
for example while two grams of plant

88
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,239
material is required if you're

89
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
harvesting

90
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,480
10 plants versus a thousand plants there

91
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
should be different number of samples

92
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,840
even though each sample only requires

93
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,080
two grams

94
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,400
here's something provided with some

95
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
general guidelines from us companies

96
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,599
waters and drinks should be looking at

97
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,958
10 milliliters or provide the full

98
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,399
finished product for disturbing

99
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
determining the fill weight on

100
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,480
analytical scale plant material looking

101
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,598
at about 2 grams concentrates only need

102
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,759
about 1 gram

103
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,719
infused products about 4 units of those

104
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,000
infused products

105
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,158
just to give you an idea of the sample

106
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,598
size with the different testing that

107
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:24,878
occurs

108
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,639
now the testing instruments high

109
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,598
performance liquid chromatography or

110
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,598
hplc

111
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,000
with diode ray detection allows us to

112
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,798
determine run spectral analysis

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
for confirmed end results good to know

114
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
what your lab is utilizing

115
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,680
for testing equipment to generate those

116
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,640
important numbers

117
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,480
on the analytical report now there are

118
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,958
testing compliance standards

119
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,560
a testing laboratory should meet gmp

120
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,479
standards glp standards and fda

121
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,318
compliant pharma practices

122
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,919
this is just kind of looking at good

123
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:54,719
manufacturing practices good labor

124
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,079
practices

125
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,560
and meeting those pharmaceutical

126
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,599
standards all other additional things to

127
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,438
be looking for

128
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,679
if you're especially comparing or

129
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,318
looking at determining what lab you want

130
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,080
to get your plant material tested at

131
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,000
so there's a great debate here should

132
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,959
the test results be expressed as a

133
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,360
number

134
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
or a range for example asking what is

135
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,920
your age

136
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,560
and providing it with how many years old

137
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,079
you are or what is your age based on you

138
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,439
know general ranges here

139
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,879
this is a great debate in the cannabis

140
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,839
industry should be looking at quoting an

141
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,600
exact number

142
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,879
or should be cutting the potency in a

143
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
range

144
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,800
so if we're looking at kind of looking

145
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,560
at expressed as a single number

146
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,918
the advantage is that it is just an

147
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,879
exact single number as we see here 38.61

148
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,039
percent

149
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,639
uh this is uh known uh with certainties

150
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
that's a great thing

151
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,079
however the disadvantages is really to

152
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,560
get that known

153
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,159
number that precise number it does

154
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,478
require a homogenized

155
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,160
sample so this cannot be done with just

156
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,399
a single dry flower

157
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,520
it has to be sold as kind of that

158
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,399
homogenized

159
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,918
sample so with that homogenized sample

160
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,038
you can't just test one single dry

161
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,478
flower you have to take multiple dry

162
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,038
flowers cut them all up

163
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,038
kind of get a kind of a mixture of that

164
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,680
and then test that to get that kind of

165
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,599
exact

166
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,560
number because different flowers as you

167
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,120
know are going to have slightly

168
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,280
different

169
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
variables than where they're located on

170
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,719
the plant and just inherent

171
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,720
in variability of that harvest

172
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
now when we're looking at a range the

173
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,120
advantage of having the

174
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,478
range expressed is that it gives you the

175
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
expected

176
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,839
range to from that product it can be

177
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,759
formed as a lot of

178
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,599
dry flour harvest for testing multiple

179
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,879
flowers you can say oh the lowest flower

180
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
was here the highest flower is here

181
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,120
after the expected range of this harvest

182
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,198
slot would be

183
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,879
this the disadvantage is it does not

184
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,840
give a single fixed number due to the

185
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,079
variability

186
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,599
and it's harder for regulatory agencies

187
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,478
to handle this pharmaceutical grade

188
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,680
material

189
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,599
that have a request a number

190
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
and not a range it's important to

191
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,560
realize that we are dealing with plant

192
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,600
material and it's expected to have some

193
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,038
variability

194
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,919
looking at different tomatoes or apples

195
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,759
and there's going to be different

196
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,918
variability from one to another

197
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,840
hopefully that range will be very small

198
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,758
but it's very hard to pinpoint an exact

199
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,038
number so this is kind of the great

200
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,759
debate should it be

201
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,879
expressed as a range or a number

202
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,960
whichever one you

203
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,159
agree with when you feel that should be

204
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,159
the accepted

205
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,400
put on a label there are different

206
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,400
videos here so you can explore

207
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,839
the advantages and kind of more details

208
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,239
of the uh

209
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,239
range kind of predict production of the

210
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,600
analog analytical report

211
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
or you could explore another video that

212
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,639
will look at the number as far as

213
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,120
provided on

214
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,800
a little political report hopefully this

215
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,399
provides you with some good information

216
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,360
and kind of this comparison that you may

217
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,679
not have thought of

218
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,038
to again help improve your education

219
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,759
regarding cannabis

220
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:46,000
at all stages including growing as well

221
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:51,199
as the end product and testing

222
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,199
