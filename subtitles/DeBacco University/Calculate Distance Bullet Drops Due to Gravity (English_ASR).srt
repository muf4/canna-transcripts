1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
so with all the factors that can impact

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
kind of a bullet

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,040
looking here we're going to look at

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,599
calculating the distance of bullet drops

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,879
due to

6
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,039
gravity for example here so

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,400
we have the acceleration of gravity

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,000
which is an important factor to keep in

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,240
mind and the acceleration of gravity is

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,240
a constant for free-falling objects

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,759
and looking specifically here for earth

12
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,640
a free-falling object has an

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,199
acceleration rate of 9.8 meters per

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
second

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,720
squared this kind of gives you that

16
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,640
visual representation

17
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,479
it's going to accelerate the distance

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,239
here at the same time points that

19
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,759
one second two seconds three four and

20
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,519
five seconds becomes greater because

21
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,238
that object is accelerating

22
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,120
in a free fall due to gravity at the

23
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,640
rate of

24
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:47,679
9.8 meters per second squared

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,160
so how far did the bullet fall due to

26
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,000
gravity

27
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,078
this is assuming the free fall and no

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,198
air resistance so just as you can

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,399
imagine

30
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,159
someone who jumps out of a plane is

31
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,600
going very quickly and when they open

32
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,319
the parachute or increase their air

33
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,359
resistance

34
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,920
their rate of fall decreases quite a bit

35
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,840
so again this is a free fall assuming no

36
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,079
air resistance to make the calculations

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
relatively easy in this case the

38
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,478
distance dropped or big d little d

39
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,080
the equation is distance dropped equals

40
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,280
g which is gravity

41
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,640
times time squared divided by 2.

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,040
and keep in mind we're going to use the

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
constant for gravity at 9.8 meters per

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
second

45
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,280
so in my practice example what is the

46
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,719
distance dropped for an object that is

47
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,000
that free falls for 3.0 seconds

48
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:35,920
so again here's our time 3.0 seconds

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,239
squared times 9.8 meters per second

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,200
divided by 2 will give us the answer of

51
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,478
the distance

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,759
dropped and you should get 44.1

53
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,679
meters so here's two more example

54
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,280
problems i walked through the first one

55
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,840
first one what's a distance drop for an

56
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,439
object that free falls for 2.5 seconds

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,719
and the second example was the distance

58
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,319
dropped for an object that free falls

59
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,879
for 5.0

60
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,319
seconds or double the amount of time so

61
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,158
you can go through and grab a calculator

62
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,718
grab a pen a pencil grab something to

63
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,359
write with

64
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,000
and go through and solve these problems

65
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,599
i'm going to

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,719
reveal the answers hopefully you've

67
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,359
paused the video and solve those

68
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,318
problems because

69
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,920
here are the answers an example one be

70
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,199
30.6 meters

71
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,199
for example 222.5 meters

72
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,799
so just an example where even though

73
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,238
we've doubled the time

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,480
that doesn't mean we've doubled the

75
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
distance remember it's 9.8 meters per

76
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,159
second squared it's that kind of

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,239
exponential kind of increase there

78
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,878
acceleration if you will

79
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,480
now how do we how would this apply well

80
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,560
we want to apply these calculations to a

81
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,518
crime scene these can be used to try to

82
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,120
determine

83
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,200
kind of where that shooter may have

84
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,599
occurred where that angle may have

85
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,799
happened how far did it fall where is a

86
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,959
convergent point

87
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,239
so we've got a lot of things to consider

88
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,519
and typically if you string out the

89
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,680
straight direction of travel and the

90
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,000
angle drop you will determine the angle

91
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,439
or degrees the shooter from the target

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,800
this is why it's important to go through

93
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,800
and do this calculation

94
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,239
because it can help you try to pinpoint

95
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,439
what may have gone on

96
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,439
at a crime scene
