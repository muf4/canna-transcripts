00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,678
on this tobacco university video we're

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,519
going to go over some specifics

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,199
regarding dry trimming so you can have a

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:16,250
better understanding of what this

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:17,359
process is all about

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,640
[Music]

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,039
all right let's get into the process of

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
dry trimming cannabis plant material

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,279
so first off dry trimming just in

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,198
general requires more space

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,359
but allows growers to carry out the

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,439
trimming process over a period of time

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,399
when i say more space that's compared to

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,000
wet trimming

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,759
the dry drying process involves cutting

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,840
the plant down and then drying it to the

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,439
desired moisture content is achieved

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,120
at which point the actual trimming

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,320
process can therefore begin

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,320
so you're hanging the plants in this

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
example letting them dry out and then

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,039
going to go through a trimming process

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,319
so what are the benefits to dry trim

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,079
well some of the benefits

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,679
when trimming dryer plants are cut down

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,280
and then dried so while the process will

27
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,079
take a little longer again compared to

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,759
wet trimming

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,119
the terpenes will be preserved to a

30
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,878
greater degree

31
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,198
then the the trichomes will harden

32
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,878
during the drying process which is when

33
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,118
it comes to trimming results in a

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
cleaner process for the person doing the

35
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:09,438
actual trimming the actual manual

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,680
process

37
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,359
of going through or kind of going

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,439
through and removing cutting

39
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,759
and kind of getting them to that final

40
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,758
finished end product

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,519
now the problems with um dry trimming is

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,439
there is no perfect method is that

43
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,200
with dry trimming there's increased risk

44
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,639
of triclone damage while trimming simply

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,320
because they're more fragile

46
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,560
when these trichomes are dried compared

47
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,319
to when they're freshly harvested or wet

48
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,000
this can also mean growers to take extra

49
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,599
care when it comes to handling the buds

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
during the trimming process

51
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,719
growers also need the space to hang

52
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
their plants to allow them to dry for

53
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,399
what could take a few weeks

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,960
typically you're looking at hopefully

55
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,759
under two weeks but again it can depend

56
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,399
on your

57
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,159
specific drying location and the volume

58
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,159
of plant material and our ability to

59
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,560
control that environment

60
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,759
now for commercial harvests when you dry

61
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,359
your harvest and then

62
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,439
trim you'll achieve a higher quality

63
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,599
with a longer slower drying period

64
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,199
which preserves terpenes better this is

65
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,158
one of the main reasons why

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,680
a lot of growers elect to do a dry trim

67
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
despite the need for hanging

68
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,439
plant material and the time to wait for

69
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,319
it to dry that is considered to be

70
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,318
advantageous

71
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,479
simply because of a higher quality end

72
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,000
product and while this process can be

73
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,679
mechanized so there's still potential

74
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,239
for physical damage to the trichomes

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
with this

76
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,319
process overall the end product will be

77
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,080
of higher quality again when compared to

78
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,519
wet trimming as long as there is space

79
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
to allow for proper drying

80
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,239
and that higher quality is the main

81
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:35,839
reason why most growers will select

82
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,719
to go through the extra challenges

83
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,598
that dry dry trimming uh kind of lends

84
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,519
itself to

85
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,518
because once all those challenges are

86
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,280
met the end product will be

87
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,800
superior and that's ultimately what's

88
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,000
going to drive and hopefully

89
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,439
get an increased dollar amount for

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,439
the end product
