1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,959
now many growers will say it's not

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,939
possible to propagate cannabis after it

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,419
flowers I'm here to tell you that it is

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,519
possible well it may not be easy if you

5
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:14,789
do find something truly unique it is

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,210
worth at least taking a shot propagating

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,739
even after a king of his plant flowers

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,359
so again it's not ideal that you do this

9
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:22,679
but sometimes it's not until you harvest

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,330
that you realize you want to preserve

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,698
the genetics you have in front of you

12
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:29,159
and it is possible but it does present

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,800
greater challenges which may reduce your

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,939
overall success percentage so keep in

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,590
mind if you are trying this for the

16
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,468
first time and you haven't propagated

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,600
before you may want to try to work on

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,308
propagation with a normal plant that's

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,140
in the vegetative state before you go

20
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,209
through and take on this challenge but

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,649
if you do have that unique individual at

22
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,020
your other to do you want to make more

23
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,058
of an propagate is worth at least a try

24
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,739
how you gonna go about doing this is

25
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:54,390
want to start by leaving some

26
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:57,030
underdeveloped lower branches with

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,799
foliage on your chosen plant you then

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,250
want to move that plant to an 18 hour

29
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,599
light six hour dark photo period you may

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,280
want to supplement with some nitrogen

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,618
fertilizers which can be done the day

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,019
after harvesting the goal here is to try

33
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:12,868
to push that vegetative growth I'll push

34
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,548
those leaf production these odds are if

35
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:17,250
you're harvesting you're just coming off

36
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,618
a flushing phase maybe or a reduction in

37
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,060
nitrogen they're fertilizers in general

38
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,700
so you want to give it a little bit of

39
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,920
that grow fertilizer boost it'll take

40
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,049
about thirty days or so the plant should

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,228
be ready for harvesting clones from

42
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,820
takes about a month or so after

43
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:34,950
flowering to kind of get it back in a

44
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,539
vegetative stage to kind of get it to

45
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,060
where it's growing again to where you're

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,618
able to harvest some vegetative cuttings

47
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,439
from that plant so you can go through

48
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:45,868
the entire propagation process so again

49
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,429
while this may not be ideal if you do

50
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:51,170
have that unique individual by all means

51
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,170
try it and I wish you the best of luck
