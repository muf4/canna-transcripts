1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,989
okay here Minh go over how to weight

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:05,310
objects which might seem rudimentary I'm

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,929
not gonna focus on triple beam balance

4
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:09,660
we're going to focus more on a digital

5
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,699
balance which might seem easier but does

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,480
have its certain quirks and proper

7
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:18,059
procedures to follow so key terms we're

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,140
looking at here gravity force that pulls

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,140
objects for the center of the Earth's

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,100
mass is the amount of matter that an

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,350
object is made of

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,689
this does not change with gravity and

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,539
weight the amount of gravity acting on

14
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,329
an object so we're talking about usually

15
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,710
getting the mass of something so well it

16
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,289
may seem easy just put it on the scale

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,149
yes but it's a bit more complicated than

18
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:40,259
that

19
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:43,379
again that's essentially what you're

20
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:45,539
doing but these details that you need to

21
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:48,839
pay attention for will ensure more

22
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,950
accurate results over time so we want to

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,410
take care of the balance want to make

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,590
sure it's on a level surface so a lot of

25
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:57,750
balances will have a kind of a bubble

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,969
built into them so you're able to tell

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,640
whether they're on a level surface or

28
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,500
not this is important to ensure accuracy

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,049
in the sensor especially for digital

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,180
balances you want to keep it clean this

31
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,729
includes before during and after its use

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,460
and calibrate the balance most balances

33
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:16,978
that you'll use in class are already

34
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,390
calibrated but they typically need to go

35
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:20,519
through a calibration process at least

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,200
initially and then repeated it every so

37
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,618
often and again helps ensure the

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,509
accuracy their balance basic electronic

39
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,969
balances need the time to warm up before

40
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,090
being used often this is not a very long

41
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,728
time but it can feel very long sometimes

42
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,439
they do a countdown until they're ready

43
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,629
to be used other times there is that

44
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,368
required warmup time especially with the

45
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:43,769
more higher end balances they can take

46
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,430
five sometimes ten fifteen minutes to

47
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:46,259
warm up

48
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,060
we also want another zero the balance

49
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,159
typically there will be an indicating

50
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,680
for that choice want to start with it

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,770
reading all zeros who want to check that

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,719
to be sure tearing the balance it's

53
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:00,179
called after the balance warms up make

54
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,368
sure it reads zero it is not zero then

55
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,170
make sure to zero it then place the

56
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,659
weigh boat on the balance the scale

57
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,009
settles to zero before adding the chosen

58
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,840
substance so what you're going to do is

59
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,488
it reads zero put your way boat on there

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,598
which is a little plastic dish then

61
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,890
you're going to tear it that's going to

62
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,989
cause it to read zero even though there

63
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,149
something on the balance they're able to

64
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,090
kind of get to read zero so that you can

65
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,349
easily know exactly how much whatever

66
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,810
substance you're adding to that

67
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:28,769
particular container in depending on the

68
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,379
degree of detail that you're looking for

69
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,600
or the number of digits that your

70
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,609
balance reads to will depend on how

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,959
precise you have to be with these more

72
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,959
precise balances you can see they're

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,750
typically enclosed in some plastic case

74
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,090
to eliminate other movements of like

75
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,719
wind currents that can't and cause it to

76
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,250
be difficult to get a consistent reading

77
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,469
lastly balances generate a more accurate

78
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,120
weight for larger samples understand

79
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:55,500
limitations and the equipment a more

80
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,230
precise balance is not necessarily

81
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,610
better so two three just because you can

82
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:01,469
read the four decimal places doesn't

83
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,480
mean it's let's say a better balance

84
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:05,939
depends on the detail that you're

85
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,310
looking for and weighing something on

86
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,129
the very end of any balance is not going

87
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,449
to give you the most accurate so a lot

88
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,400
of times we're looking at scaling that

89
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:15,988
up or treating dilution rates or

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,659
something like that to be able to get

91
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,170
the most accurate inconsistent reading

92
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,169
possible
