00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,960
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,599
going to go over some more details

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:17,440
to explain dry trimming of cannabis

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:19,039
plant material

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,480
all right let's get into wet trimming

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,920
cannabis plant material and

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,480
learn a little bit more about this

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,480
process so wet trimming

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
well when we're wet trimming yields a

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,199
higher flower to trim ratio but requires

11
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,000
more equipment and has less room for

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,600
error

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,359
a wet trimming method involves cutting

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,039
the plant down followed immediately by

15
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,519
the removal of the fan leaves

16
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,558
and detailed trimming of the bud after

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,200
this is completed

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,280
then the drying process can begin this

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,039
process is common for very large growing

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,399
operations since there is typically not

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
enough drying space

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,879
so performing an initial wet trim is

23
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,558
needed to reduce the overall biomass

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,359
before the drying process can actually

25
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,198
start

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,799
so you're kind of going through

27
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:59,839
harvesting the plant and trimming it

28
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,038
right away

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,439
kind of immediately after harvesting

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,280
now the benefits to this method is that

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,559
wet trimming is recommended by growers

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,519
because of the greater trichome

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,240
preservation

34
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,158
and quicker harvesting time all with

35
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,679
less space needed for the actual drying

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,118
process because you're kind of removing

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,280
all the plant material

38
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,159
that you really don't need anyway buds

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,519
can kind of puff

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
out appealing larger and more

41
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,200
aesthetically pleasing in some cases

42
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,118
commercial growers typically see the

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
puff out as a huge reason

44
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,478
to wet trim to kind of create that

45
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,319
visual effect

46
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,319
this also makes the drying process

47
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,118
faster by removing much of the moisture

48
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,959
in the plant

49
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,319
and can help reduce the stress on your

50
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,199
drying equipment if you're trying to

51
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,039
maintain

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,439
which hopefully you are certain humidity

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,799
levels in the drying space

54
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,478
now the problems with wet trimming

55
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,880
because it's not a perfect method is

56
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,438
that

57
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,399
it's not as clean as a process as dry

58
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:51,519
trimming

59
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,799
so with wet trimming there'll be

60
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,000
noticeable residue build up on the

61
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,240
shears which will need

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
cleaning also the takedown of the plants

63
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,438
followed immediately by trimming

64
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
also compresses some of the required

65
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,519
work that needs to be accomplished and

66
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,280
this can make it a very difficult

67
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,280
process to be able to complete all in

68
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,959
one fellow swoop

69
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,800
looking at commercial harvesting

70
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,199
locations with commercial harvesting

71
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
often speed and efficiency is important

72
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,479
which is part of the reason why wet

73
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,199
trimming can be selected

74
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,639
wet trimming is also faster compared to

75
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,238
the detail orientedness of dry trimming

76
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,318
process however there will likely be

77
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,800
some trichome loss since the drying

78
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,639
process

79
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,319
there will not be any sugar leaves to

80
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,279
provide protection

81
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,598
the goal of volume and reduced time to

82
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,519
sail can hurt individual bud quality

83
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,598
as wet string material may not reach top

84
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,080
quality that can be achieved with a dry

85
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,919
trim

86
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,200
that's kind of a very important thing to

87
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,079
note there is that while it might be an

88
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,878
easier quicker

89
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,319
process it might hurt or reduce your

90
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,719
overall bud quality

91
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,399
if you're comparing it to a dry trim and

92
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,239
that reason and that reason alone

93
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
is why many growers will only go through

94
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
the dry trim process

95
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
and will not do anything with a wet trim

96
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:00,799
process

97
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,159
you can see that there are kind of some

98
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,519
advantages to wet trim and that's why

99
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,079
some girls do elect

100
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,200
to utilize the wet trim option of their

101
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
cannabis plants
