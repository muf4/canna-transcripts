1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
okay here I look at the basic

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,990
organization of life starting with the

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:09,000
most simple atomic scale and working our

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,638
all the way off throughout the different

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,980
stages and levels so starting at the

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,858
atom level that's considered the most

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,170
basic organization there's atoms kind of

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,810
come together to form molecules in this

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,210
case we have oxygen alone forming the

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,848
molecule of the acid or oxygen here

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,410
found in the air oxygen and other

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,910
molecules can combine it for

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,549
macromolecules but we're going to spend

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,219
an entire unit on macromolecules these

15
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,539
macromolecules such as a phospholipid

16
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:38,640
soubise phospholipid bilayer and that's

17
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,619
a component of the cell so here we have

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,270
the cell which is again composed of

19
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,459
atoms which formed together to make

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,680
molecules which make macromolecules or

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,160
big molecules those then come together

22
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:53,820
to make cells and so we continue on to

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,339
tissues so a combined organization of

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,140
cells from tissues those tissues can

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,079
then combine from an organs which is the

26
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,539
lung we then have an organ system such

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,549
as the respiratory system here and those

28
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,250
organ systems can then make an organism

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,510
such as a lion here as respiratory

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,859
digestive reproductive system and many

31
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,290
more that come together to make the

32
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,599
organism from the organism now we can

33
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,920
continue I know population where we have

34
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,199
multiple Lions here

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,478
no population we go to a community we

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,180
have lions and zebras and from a

37
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,099
community built on doing ecosystem or

38
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,229
attacking in the environment and that

39
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,688
can ultimately here to the biosphere

40
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:36,179
which is life on Earth we're going to

41
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:39,449
focus on different units throughout this

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,030
entire biology unit on populations

43
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:45,180
communities ecosystems and also touch on

44
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,560
the biosphere now life is emergent

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,340
properties so what does it mean being an

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,769
emergent property

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,390
well merchants properties are basically

48
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,429
the consequence of structural

49
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,399
organization that is the hallmark of

50
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,829
life they are characterized by many

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,079
aspects of the living world and each

52
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,179
higher level organization contains novel

53
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,908
properties not present and simple

54
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,110
simpler level of organization so what is

55
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,780
this kind of like how does this relate

56
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,128
or mean to the pictures I put here we

57
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,539
have the picture of the brain here not

58
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:13,649
going to go into all the details of it

59
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,688
here

60
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,879
a single neuron cannot perform the

61
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:19,530
function that the brain does just like a

62
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,628
single bird here cannot perform the

63
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,729
function of the entire flock when

64
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:26,729
neurons are all working together as a

65
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,949
functional brain it's that is where

66
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:31,229
you're having an emergent property when

67
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,389
no single neuron can perform this task

68
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:35,518
no single bird can perform the tasks of

69
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:38,098
the flock here you have a collection all

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,469
working together this is an example of

71
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:43,280
an emergent property that gets back to

72
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:43,280
the organization
