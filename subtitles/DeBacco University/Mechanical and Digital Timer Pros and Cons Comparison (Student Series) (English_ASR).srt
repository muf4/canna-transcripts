1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,318
on this debaco university student series

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,960
video we're going to look at both the

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:10,638
pros and cons and compare a mechanical

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,160
timer to a digital timer now many of you

5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:13,599
may make the decision of using one

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,519
versus another but this is going to

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,199
provide you with that information so you

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,800
can make an educated decision on which

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,279
one is the best for your growing

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,278
operation

11
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:29,920
[Music]

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,000
these are both timers that you could use

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,719
for your grow this one is a digital

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,719
timer and this one is a mechanical timer

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,800
they both have their pros and cons which

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,558
we will be going over in this video so

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,640
that you can determine which is best for

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,199
your operation now we're going to go

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
over the pros and cons of a mechanical

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
timer

21
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,198
so as you can see a mechanical timer is

22
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,280
a bit more straightforward and simple

23
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,159
than a digital timer there's a lot less

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,000
going on right here for you to work with

25
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,919
really you only have to press down some

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,759
buttons and move

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,039
some things left and right for it to be

28
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,000
set up

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,239
a con would be that you have to set it

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,640
up through 15 minute increments the most

31
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,118
precise that you could be on this is by

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,280
15 minutes which isn't usually a problem

33
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,200
but some people would like to have it be

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,840
a little bit more precise

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,879
another con is on the side we have a

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,960
switch that goes from timer to

37
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,798
indefinite this means that the light

38
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,280
will be on indefinitely and it's very

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,200
easy to sometimes switch this into the

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
indefinite meaning that your light will

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,478
not switch off when you have it

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
scheduled to meaning that your photo

43
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,679
period may be

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,840
interrupted so now we're going to be

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,479
talking about the pros and cons of a

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,478
digital timer some of the pros are that

47
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,319
it's just more precise in general you

48
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,879
can see the exact time and we have a

49
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,639
bunch more buttons to work with we see

50
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,438
we could just the day of the week the

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,280
hour the minute even the second

52
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,279
another pro is that it has a battery

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,280
backup so just in case something was to

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,118
happen where you lose power this will

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,439
actually remember what time it is it

56
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,438
will retain the exact time so that

57
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,438
nothing is really changed within your

58
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,598
schedule for when the lights turn back

59
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,799
on or off

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,959
a con would be that it's just a little

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,560
more complicated than a mechanical timer

62
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,120
if you're used to a mechanical timer

63
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,598
then all of these buttons may be a

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,360
little overwhelming at first i mean you

65
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,519
may be confused as to why you need

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
seconds when before you were adjusting

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,879
by the 15 minute increments

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,719
another con is that it's kind of just

69
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,479
the buttons are tiny and close together

70
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,479
so if you had big fingers you have the

71
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,159
risk of pressing multiple buttons or if

72
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,159
somebody was being careless they could

73
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,318
accidentally hit one of these buttons

74
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,199
which could change your timing from

75
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,039
being auto to just on all the time or

76
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,399
off all the time which would impact your

77
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,400
photo period

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,319
another con is that unlike a mechanical

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,719
timer you can't really see the logistics

80
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,639
of what's happening inside this timer

81
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,280
you just kind of have to hope that

82
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,958
everything's going on properly within

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,280
the timer

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,280
and just keep checking to see if

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,439
anything looks off just by this little

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,199
screen here rather than being able to

87
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,239
see everything that's going on with your

88
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,919
timer

89
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,920
so now that we've gone through the pros

90
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,238
and cons of both the mechanical and

91
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,158
digital timer is that for you as a

92
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,120
grower to decide which one you would

93
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:23,199
like to implement in your grow operation

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,799
now a tip from debacle himself would to

95
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,679
be would be to use the digital timer for

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,680
your

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
pumps because when you feed your plants

98
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,599
is very important down to the exact

99
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,439
second and to use the mechanical timer

100
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,039
for your lights because a 15 minute

101
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,439
difference isn't going to drastically

102
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,439
affect your photo period so in the end

103
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,000
it is up to you whether you will decide

104
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,079
to use a digital or a mechanical timer

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,919
either way it'll be one step closer to

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,719
fully automating your grow and making

107
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,719
your life a step easier

108
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,840
you
