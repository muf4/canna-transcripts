1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
dna replication occurs in what we call a

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,839
semiconservative

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,320
method so i'm going to explore the

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,679
details of what does this actually mean

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,120
what's actually going on in the cells

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,960
when dna is replicated in the

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,599
semi-conservative replication

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,199
method so there's three possible methods

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,359
for replication there's conservative

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,640
semiconservative and then disruptive

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,160
well in conservative

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,839
the original dna molecule would be

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
preserved and you see that here where

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,118
the

15
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,640
parental dna is still present throughout

16
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,239
the first replication and also the

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,000
second replication

18
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,359
semi-conservative the daughter dna

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,679
contains one old

20
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,759
in one new strain we see that here where

21
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,119
original dna the parental dna we have

22
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,039
one old and one new

23
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,439
one and one new and that's replicated

24
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,960
throughout then disruptive where the old

25
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,238
and new strands are dispersed in

26
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,079
daughter molecules kind of in this kind

27
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,320
of random kind of pattern here

28
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,198
so the three possible methods for

29
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,799
replication

30
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,839
the one you really want to focus on is

31
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,119
this semi-conservative method

32
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,559
so how does it kind of look well this

33
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,479
kind of shows another rendition with

34
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,839
dark red and kind of a faint red

35
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,079
of semi-conservative where you still

36
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,519
have that one template strand

37
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,280
and then conservative or that original

38
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
strand is left untouched and then

39
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,680
disruptive where there's different

40
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
sections

41
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,600
keep in mind that conservative and

42
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,359
disruptive these little asterisks means

43
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,879
they're found not to be biologically

44
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,680
significant it's this

45
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,399
semi-conservative method that is the

46
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,439
process

47
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
for dna replication now evidence for

48
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:25,438
semi-conservative replication has been a

49
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,279
lot of

50
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,559
studies conducted to help prove this

51
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,439
here we have one where there's a

52
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
radioactively

53
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,478
labeled nitrogen base where we're having

54
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
this

55
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,000
nitrogen and we're going through and

56
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,240
looking at different densities over

57
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
different generations of e coli

58
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,000
we could see here that semi-conservative

59
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,879
is occurring because we have this kind

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
of blending

61
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,199
that's occurring we have this kind of

62
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,200
loss in percent of that original strand

63
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
on that original labeled i'm in the

64
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,680
sense and proving that

65
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,679
we have this semi-conservativeness going

66
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
on we have that original parental strain

67
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,799
but we have these new strands going

68
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,240
through

69
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,079
how does this look in like another

70
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,199
experiment well with any experiment you

71
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,559
could have predictions

72
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
and these predictions here show that we

73
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,959
have

74
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
what conservative semi-conservative and

75
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,439
disruptive would look like

76
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,039
so for conservative we would have that

77
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,959
same original strand

78
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,159
present at the end well that was proved

79
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,520
not to be the case

80
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,359
in disruptive we have that parental

81
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,080
strain but we'd have a continual

82
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,120
mix of them those splicings of those

83
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,440
daughter cells

84
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,959
doesn't occur this semi-conservativeness

85
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,598
we have that original parental strand

86
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,199
then we have that kind of replication

87
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:33,759
step where we're keeping that parental

88
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,679
strand

89
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,560
but we're getting new strands that are

90
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,879
developing this was found through that

91
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,199
radioactively labeling and allows

92
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,318
scientists to depict where did specific

93
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,479
molecules go

94
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,639
it allows them to trace them and this

95
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,318
kind of semi-conservativeness here

96
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,479
where we're seeing that original strand

97
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,560
all being this kind of heavy medium this

98
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,919
low in the test tube then we have this

99
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,280
kind of mixing we have this kind of

100
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,719
light medium it's kind of like

101
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,400
medium range kind of result and then we

102
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,158
have once we're making all of the new

103
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,200
strands which is made of that lighter

104
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,679
nitrogen we can see that blending of the

105
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,280
two

106
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,040
we see a lot of those new strands being

107
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,919
that lighter component but we still have

108
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,318
that

109
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,359
mixture of those original parental

110
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,238
strands for that first

111
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
generation those replication options

112
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,200
again kind of shows

113
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
the same kind of process here

114
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,280
semi-conservative you have those

115
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,400
one dark strand and one yellow strand

116
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,360
destructive there would be all little

117
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,879
different pieces

118
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,959
and conservative that dark strand would

119
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:35,039
stay the same and you'd only have

120
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,680
new strands so how does dna copy itself

121
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,199
well it's using that original base

122
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
here's our double helix

123
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,318
we're separating it out it's using that

124
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,640
original base as a

125
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,399
template which is very important because

126
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,399
it's able to use that template

127
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,640
it really reduces the chance of any

128
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,879
errors being made

129
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,039
now dna copying each cell division must

130
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,280
copy the entire dna sequence so each

131
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,519
star cell gets a complete copy

132
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,039
now the rate of synthesis is very fast

133
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,680
this kind of gives you that rendition

134
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,438
here

135
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,438
of seeing just how quick it kind of can

136
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,079
occur in bacteria they can do about a

137
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,400
thousand

138
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,879
bases per second and in mammals only

139
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,360
about 100 bases per second but still

140
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,318
a very quick overall kind of run through

141
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,799
here

142
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:20,079
as we see how quickly we can replicate

143
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,078
those dna strands

144
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,918
now the problem with a single

145
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
replication origin is that a bacterial

146
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,439
genome

147
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,919
is 4 times 10 to the 6th power it takes

148
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,478
about only

149
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,758
20 minutes to copy and we see that here

150
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,039
human genome

151
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,720
if we have that single point of

152
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,240
replication because it's so much bigger

153
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
would take 10 000 times

154
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,160
longer which would be basically

155
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,279
biologically just

156
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,199
inhibitive so as a result human genomes

157
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,198
many eukaryotes have these replication

158
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,759
bubbles or these multiple points

159
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,720
along the dna for replication to occur

160
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,479
not just one

161
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,600
single site now the copying solutions

162
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,000
region is an at that adenine and diamine

163
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,680
rich

164
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,439
allow easy separation remember those

165
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,038
only have two hydrogen bonds

166
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,680
eukaryotes have multiple replication

167
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,439
origins humans can have like 10 000

168
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,199
origin points and eventually these are

169
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,839
all meat getting into

170
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,879
our newly synthesized dna really helps

171
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,839
reduce the time

172
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,079
for this to occur so the copying

173
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,679
solutions a double helix to be copied is

174
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,560
through semi-conservativeness

175
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,199
which basically means one of our double

176
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,959
strand

177
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,240
one's being used as a template strand

178
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,560
and the other one is the

179
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,319
new replicated strand each daughter cell

180
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,720
gets one of the original copies

181
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,560
and then one of the new copies to help

182
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,639
reduce the chance for errors

183
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,720
unwinding at one point is used at the

184
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,240
replication site and in humans

185
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,000
and eukaryotes with long genomes

186
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,519
there'll be multiple replication sites

187
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,839
but they will all follow

188
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,079
this semi-conservative replication

189
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,079
method
