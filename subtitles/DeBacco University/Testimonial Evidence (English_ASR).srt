1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
okay here are we looking at testimonial

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,830
evidence and how it might relate to a

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,019
witness that might be brought in to

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:12,750
relay what they saw at a crime scene for

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,298
example so eyewitness evidence

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,710
this can be oral or written statements

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:18,570
they can be useful to help an

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,760
investigation but are not considered

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,850
highly reliable so even though a lot of

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,320
effort may go into finding a witness

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:28,140
there are evidence that they provide is

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,868
often not considered to be highly

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,090
reliable in a court setting eyewitness

14
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:35,308
testimony can have an influence on the

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,380
trial though so this is important to

16
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:40,140
remember this balance between what

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,890
actually happened and what is reliable

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,409
evidence and what may influence the jury

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,969
during the trial so the same but

20
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:50,218
different two people can view the same

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,170
scene in different ways which can be due

22
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,510
to the simple angle that they were

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,039
viewing the occur in the middle of the

24
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:57,929
street it was one person on one set of

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,030
street or the other one person in the

26
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,100
street there's simple angle of viewing

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,588
depending on cars in the way or other

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,000
objects familiar with the area is this

29
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:07,079
someone that was visiting the areas as

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,900
someone who's lived there a long time

31
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,390
that can also influence how much detail

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,760
able to provide age of the individual

33
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,599
race of the witness in the suspect we'll

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,560
talk about that in moment a drug use

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,509
within that whether they want to admit

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,790
it or not person's ability to remember

37
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,769
the details and basically other stories

38
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,860
that might get involved or layered in

39
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:32,368
that may distract from the original

40
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:34,078
occurrence of crime so age impacts

41
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:35,519
eyewitness accuracy so it was

42
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,289
interesting is that young children in

43
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,500
the elderly have a high rate of accuracy

44
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,659
when a lamp contains the actual suspect

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,609
however when the suspect is not present

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,320
this increases the rate of mistaken

47
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:49,228
identities just because you have a

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,228
lineup of five people here we hope that

49
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:54,209
you'd have the actual person that's

50
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,728
guilty there but we have to remember

51
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:58,109
that it may not always be the case so

52
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,209
there could be mistaken identities

53
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:02,188
people could think that oh yeah I'm not

54
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,438
sure remember exactly how they looked

55
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,750
but you know it really looked a lot like

56
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,359
you know number two here or something

57
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,098
that can lead to that false or mistaken

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,870
identities and then lead them to develop

59
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:14,389
their own story in their head even

60
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,650
though it may not be accurate

61
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:19,349
race has an impact so people are

62
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,810
generally able more accurately identify

63
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,819
people of their own race it's important

64
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,349
when we're looking at someone pointing

65
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,000
something out of a lineup if it is

66
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,099
someone of a different race the odds are

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,930
of mistaken identities is increase if

68
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,109
that race is different than the person

69
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,870
doing the identifying drugs alter your

70
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,610
memory drugs use can impact a person's

71
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,849
ability to remember events even after

72
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:45,209
the drug effects are no longer active

73
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:46,859
this could have an influence it's based

74
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,140
on their memory and they may not want to

75
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,610
admit that these drugs during before or

76
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,500
after especially if they're illegal

77
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,270
drugs this is just again something to

78
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,060
consider we're looking at eyewitness

79
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,680
testimony and lastly pure influence

80
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,390
someone's testimony can be influenced by

81
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,270
other witnesses accounts of the events

82
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,649
if they hear what someone else said they

83
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,840
might kind of be leaning in that

84
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,849
direction or kind of kind of go down the

85
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,379
wrong path this is why open-ended

86
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,629
questions tend to be used to allow the

87
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,489
witness to not be guided by how the

88
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,859
question was asked trying to leave it

89
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,900
more open-ended rather than kind of

90
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,730
getting into exact detail even though

91
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,799
that's something somebody may want when

92
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:24,988
they're kind of interrogating or

93
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,819
interviewing someone so also keeping

94
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,289
them isolated and not allowing them hear

95
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,659
other people's testimony can also be

96
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:32,759
beneficial that they won't kind of be

97
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:35,180
influenced by other stories that they

98
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,179
may hear
