1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,519
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,599
we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,189
vapor pressure deficit and how it

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:15,279
relates to cannabis plants

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:16,640
[Music]

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,679
all right let's get into how vapor

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,439
pressure deficit impacts cannabis plants

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,198
well first off it's typically

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,719
abbreviated vpd and it will be

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,320
throughout this presentation

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,919
and this is an advanced method for

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,278
understanding and measuring the indoor

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,240
or technically outdoor growing

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:31,759
environment

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,600
for outdoor it's more used for

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
monitoring and for indoors it can

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,640
calculate you can calculate the vpd and

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,879
then make changes

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,239
to your growing conditions this does

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,079
require more equipment to gather

21
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,519
information and understanding of the

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,200
overall growing environment

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,960
which is why this is considered to be a

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,160
more advanced technique

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,079
we also have the vapor pressure of the

26
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,759
air to take into consideration the leaf

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,840
vapor pressure and together

28
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,000
these in combination or information

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,480
being used to get the vpd the vapor

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,920
pressure to deficit between those two

31
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,119
now the equipment that you need you need

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,640
a thermometer

33
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,158
because you need to have an idea what

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,079
the air temperature is you also need a

35
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,560
hydrometer which is basically measuring

36
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,719
the humidity in the area and an

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
infrared ir thermometer that because

38
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,400
that is going to be used

39
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,759
to provide the temperature of the leaf

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
with the data generated you can

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,920
calculate the vpd

42
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,599
of the growing space so keep in mind

43
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,159
that the vpd does take into account the

44
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,640
entire

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,079
environment this allows a consistent

46
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,200
measure that takes into account three

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,319
main variables

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,280
within any given growth space so when

49
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,919
we're looking at

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
the influences on vpd one is

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
transpiration

52
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,478
as epd increases the plant is going to

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,359
transpire at a greater rate it's going

54
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,879
to move water

55
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:50,159
through its material at a greater rate

56
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,000
the stomata opening as vpd increases the

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,640
stomata get smaller or basically start

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,438
to close

59
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,280
up for carbon dioxide uptake as vpd

60
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,438
increases the stomata gets smaller

61
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,118
and that's going to reduce or restrict

62
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,718
carbon dioxide uptake because those

63
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:03,200
stomata are porous the underside of the

64
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:04,959
leaves

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,799
allowing for gas exchange and when

66
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,560
they're smaller or get closed up

67
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,479
we cannot have as much carbon dioxide

68
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,920
being taken into the plant

69
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,319
and then nutrient intake at the root

70
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,919
level increasing vpd and transpiration

71
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,919
rates will mean the roots will pull

72
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,919
more nutrients which can be important

73
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,479
implant stress increasing vpd will

74
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,238
increase the plant stress as well

75
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,598
now this is a great kind of summary

76
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,200
chart here

77
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,318
it's cited in the description so if you

78
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,919
want to go through and find the original

79
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,199
source you're more than welcome to

80
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,518
but you're also encouraged to kind of

81
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,560
take a screenshot of this pause the

82
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,480
video here

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
and do a little comparison look at the

84
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,119
temperature of the area

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,719
and here we have degrees fahrenheit and

86
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,319
here's the relative humidity

87
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,080
of the growing space you can kind of see

88
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,199
where those match up of course your goal

89
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,879
is to be in this nice

90
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,959
dark region dark green region right here

91
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,479
now the vapor pressure looking at

92
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,598
conversion factors because

93
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,359
different meters read in different units

94
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,359
it's important to know or be able to

95
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,040
compare two different sources

96
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,800
so the most common unit of measure is

97
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,759
kilo pascals or kpa

98
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,519
however inches of mercury or ion of hg

99
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,039
is also used

100
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,879
here are the convol following conversion

101
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,840
factors we can see if you have kpa

102
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,158
and to get kpa from inches of mercury

103
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,759
you

104
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,719
multiply whatever reading you get in

105
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,239
inches of mercury by 3.386

106
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,400
and if you have kpa you want to get to

107
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,120
inches of mercury you take your kpa

108
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
reading and multiply it by 0.296 to get

109
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,158
your interest of mercury

110
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,959
if you're looking at hectopascals we see

111
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:36,000
the conversion down here at the bottom

112
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,280
now some suggested target levels of this

113
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,479
vpd by growth phase typically as the

114
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,439
plants get older

115
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,039
we want to increase the vpd propagation

116
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,400
or early veg and again just general

117
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,079
targets to shoot for

118
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,640
0.2 to 0.8 kpas for late veg and early

119
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,319
flower

120
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,359
looking at 0.8 to 1.4 kpa for mid flower

121
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,039
to late flower 1.2 to 1.5 kpa

122
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
and again here's some other suggestions

123
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,639
and these are a great way

124
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,039
to have that target level set at least

125
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,919
initially as you're looking at different

126
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,959
phases of your cannabis plants

127
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,598
how does the environment impact the vpd

128
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,640
now as you increase the temperature so

129
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,159
does the vpd

130
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,680
and inversely as you decrease the

131
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,919
temperature so does the vpd

132
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
those are directly correlated however

133
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
humidity

134
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,160
as you increase humidity you will

135
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
decrease vpds those are inversely

136
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,439
relation

137
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,360
inverse relationship simply as you

138
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,839
decrease humidity you will also increase

139
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
vpd and that inverse relationship there

140
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,359
as you increase the light intensity

141
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,639
you're increasing the light temps which

142
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,040
will also

143
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,560
sorry increase the light intensity this

144
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
will increase the temperature

145
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,000
of the leaf is that light is impacting

146
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,840
the leaf there

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,399
with that increase in leaf temperature

148
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,399
that will also increase your vpd

149
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,439
decreasing the light intensity decreases

150
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,918
leaf temps and

151
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,719
then decreases vpd so just to give you

152
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,478
an idea

153
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,960
how these three environments will impact

154
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,159
this now relative humidity at given

155
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,799
temperatures

156
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,560
so suggested values are required to

157
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
maintain ideal growing conditions

158
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,000
this is when the lights are on so this

159
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,680
again gives you kind of a fahrenheit and

160
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,360
celsius temperature

161
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,439
and kind of that humidity there and

162
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,160
looking at that target ranges there

163
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,560
for those vpds as expressed earlier

164
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,000
again

165
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
sources in the description there if you

166
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,639
want to look at this but again gives you

167
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
a good kind of general

168
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,280
target range to be aiming for now

169
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,400
transpiration that was talked about this

170
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,000
is movement of water

171
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,359
in the plants water first enters the

172
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,038
roots of the plant and will travel

173
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
through the plant and exit out small

174
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,719
regulated pores

175
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,000
called this stomata this general

176
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,039
movement of water is called

177
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,478
transpiration and

178
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,959
allows for nutrients to move through the

179
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:43,680
plant and also is a method of cooling

180
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,680
the plant

181
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,120
most of the plant's water that's uptake

182
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,720
is used for cooling

183
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
the humidity is considered to be around

184
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,639
100 inside the leaf

185
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,680
and this represents saturated vapor

186
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,319
pressure so here we see you know

187
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,840
roots in the ground water being absorbed

188
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
mainly by the xylem

189
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,879
moving its way up through the plant and

190
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,840
coming out the leaves

191
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,680
there now transpiration the details of

192
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,879
transpiration may be more details than

193
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,038
you care to know

194
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,159
uh here we're looking at the kind of

195
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,680
properties of water

196
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,840
the hydrogen bonding of water the

197
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,560
adhesive and cohesive properties of

198
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,159
water

199
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
allowing them to kind of like work their

200
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,400
way up the

201
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
stem here so this is kind of the within

202
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,120
the xylem vesicle and there's xylem

203
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,600
there's also phloem

204
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,199
phloem is more of the minerals and

205
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
nutrients and phloem can move up and

206
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,919
down the plant

207
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,400
xylem is basically going from what's

208
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,399
called the roots up to the shoots

209
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,239
and you see we see here that getting in

210
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,758
the intermolecular forces the partial

211
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,360
positive partial negatives

212
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,520
kind of linking of these water molecules

213
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
together helping this move its way up

214
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,639
through the plant

215
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,000
so a little kind of plant biology there

216
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,598
for you

217
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,120
then those transpiration rates will

218
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,639
transpiration rates will be faster in

219
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,280
hot and dry conditions

220
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
rates will slow in high humidity because

221
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,758
water

222
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,119
has no place to evaporate to so when

223
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,560
it's hot and it's kind of your sticky

224
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,240
that's because you're evaporating

225
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,598
we're trying to evaporate to cool

226
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,079
yourself there's so much moisture in the

227
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:05,680
air

228
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,199
you kind of have that sticky feeling at

229
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,560
high humidity conditions

230
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,160
the stomata needs to be regulated

231
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,319
because when they're open they can let

232
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,439
co2 in for the photosynthetic process

233
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,960
which is great

234
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,319
but at the same time the plant is also

235
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,519
losing water so as to make sure it's

236
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,879
adequately hydrated

237
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,799
plants need to balance out the ability

238
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,240
to photosynthesize and also remain

239
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,079
hydrated

240
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,759
general conditions here we can see the

241
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,199
rate of transpiration increases with

242
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,160
temperature to a certain point and then

243
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,120
we'll plateau

244
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,720
so even though the temperature is

245
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,959
increasing that kind of rate

246
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,960
transpiration is kind of flat line there

247
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,918
wind velocity for those that have a fan

248
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,038
on their plants or growing in the

249
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,120
outdoor environment

250
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:41,439
typically as the wind velocity increases

251
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,918
so will the transpiration rate

252
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,959
now the humidity as our humidity

253
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,279
increases

254
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,758
our rate of transpiration will decrease

255
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,000
simply because the water within the leaf

256
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,439
has nowhere to evaporate to and if the

257
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,519
water's in order to evaporate too

258
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,199
it's no point for the plant can take in

259
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,478
more water move it up through the xylem

260
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,560
move it up through the stem

261
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,399
therefore the increased humidity not

262
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
allowing water to escape out the stomata

263
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,758
will decrease

264
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
those transpiration rates so hopefully

265
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,560
this helps you better understand the vpd

266
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,560
and allows you to maximize the growing

267
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
conditions of your cannabis plants
