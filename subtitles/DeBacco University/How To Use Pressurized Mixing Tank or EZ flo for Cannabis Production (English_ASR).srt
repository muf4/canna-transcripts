1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
here on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,720
going to go over how to use a

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:16,560
pressurized mixing tank or easy flow

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:18,000
for cannabis plant production

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,679
ever wonder how to use a pressurized

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,800
mixing tank or easy flow for canvas

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,278
plant production

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,519
this is the video for you so this is

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,480
what one typical setup looks like

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,879
we're going to go into some of the

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,080
details here in this video so first off

12
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,558
we have to understand the system

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,238
parts typically this system easily

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,479
attaches to a faucet hose

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,919
which is why it became so popular it's

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,000
very easy to hook up

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,079
with essentially part that allows for

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,320
some water to divert into the tank

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
you see here uh that contains the

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,840
fertilizer can slowly be

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,559
fed into the mainline hose or irrigation

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,079
system

23
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,000
so basically it's pumping water in

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,439
pressurizing the tank forcing a little

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,479
bit out that has fertilizer and

26
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,718
irrigation water

27
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,000
and putting it into the irrigation hose

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,800
so a very simple

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,759
concept how does it operate well the

30
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,679
basic method

31
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,599
is that the mixing tank injector

32
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,159
operates at the discharge line

33
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,199
on a pressurized differential concept so

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,799
we do have some pressure

35
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,359
difference pressure coming in pressure

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,520
coming out and kind of the device

37
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,118
in the middle there so the water is

38
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,359
diverted from the main flow

39
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,519
mixed with the fertilizer and then

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,000
injected or drawn back into the main

41
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,560
system so it kind of comes in gets

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,719
through

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
mixed around and then put back into the

44
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,158
system a measured amount of fertilizer

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,359
required for one injection is placed

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,880
into the cylinder

47
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,560
flow back into the main line is often

48
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,399
controlled by a metering device

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,519
installed at the inlet side of the

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,439
injector

51
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,959
to operate again as described previously

52
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:41,919
there must be pressure difference in the

53
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,679
injector line and

54
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,000
inlet and outlet so there is that

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,439
pressure uh differential that is needed

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
and the valve there now there are some

57
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,199
fittings that should take care of this

58
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,159
but keep in mind in low pressure systems

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,359
this may not be the best option for you

60
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,799
so there's a visualization of the

61
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,519
process which is why some growers like

62
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,000
it

63
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:03,840
the connection here of the injector

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,359
the concentration i should say of the

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,118
injector fertilizer

66
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,360
does change as the chemical becomes

67
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,038
diluted as water enters the tank

68
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
so think of it this way showing over a

69
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,199
long period of time this is a very large

70
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,639
tank

71
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,479
we have kind of a solid amount of

72
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,519
fertilizer over time

73
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,399
we're using up more and more and more of

74
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,920
that fertilizer

75
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,920
we're getting more and more diluted to

76
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,479
the point we essentially just have pure

77
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,039
water

78
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,399
uh irrigation water left in the tank at

79
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,159
this point we'd go through and we change

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,959
that and then we'd go through and we'd

81
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,159
refill it

82
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,159
and repeat the same process again

83
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,280
so the key points to remember are that

84
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,919
only install

85
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,800
uh in an on off pressure applications

86
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,039
where the system's

87
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,239
only under pressure when in use you do

88
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,560
not want to have this

89
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,319
tank under constant pressure you want to

90
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,400
have a valve before it so when the valve

91
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,679
turns off the pressure is alleviated

92
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,120
from the tank

93
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,959
also this will prevent the chance of

94
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,759
fertilizer back feeding as well if you

95
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,800
have that kind of

96
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,120
additional device in line do not use if

97
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
there's over 50 psi or pounds per square

98
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
inch as this can damage the system or

99
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
some of the components of the system

100
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,399
do not let this tank freeze because

101
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,640
water expands when it freezes

102
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
it can damage the tank or the upper

103
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,279
portion the internal workings

104
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,759
as well now the feed rate you'll notice

105
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
some of these do have a listed feed rate

106
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,959
so there are different flow rates which

107
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,000
can change the ratio of irrigation water

108
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,920
fertilizer

109
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,598
while this is a range since it is not

110
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,878
exact it does provide grower in

111
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,798
approximation

112
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,919
of the dilution rates for different

113
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,159
fertilizers

114
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,839
and see we have a slow and then we have

115
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,519
a number one setting here and it tells

116
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,920
you the capacity this is a

117
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,200
0.75 or three-quarter gallon tank in

118
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,439
gallons to empty

119
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,199
at the slow setting it'll take about 750

120
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,878
gallons to empty the tank

121
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,000
and in a faster setting it'll only take

122
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,840
375 so growers can make this adjustment

123
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,080
for the speed or rate that they want to

124
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
add their fertilizer

125
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
now the general fertilizer application

126
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
rate example here

127
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,639
just to provide you with some numbers so

128
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,719
you can see how well

129
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,318
you can apply it to your own situation

130
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,598
there will be some adjustments made but

131
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,679
this can provide just a good

132
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,518
starting point growers will often add

133
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
food dye to the fertilizer to be able to

134
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,000
see

135
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,519
the dilution and consumption visually

136
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,239
and allow them to further and quickly

137
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,039
dial in

138
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,720
their rates here if we're applying 3.5

139
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,000
pounds of triple twenty two thousand

140
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,840
square feet per week

141
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,680
once you have fruit set apply five

142
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,519
pounds per one

143
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,280
thousand feet of 16 326

144
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,639
with calcium so if you're growing

145
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,879
tomatoes peppers you should

146
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,478
spray them weekly with calcium chelates

147
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,918
at a rate of one

148
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,279
at a rate of two ounces per thousand

149
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,439
square feet this is what the

150
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,679
manufacturers recommend there

151
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,719
so you could also search them up when

152
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,600
you purchase one

153
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,120
look at the important documentation

154
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,320
because the one that you purchase

155
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,399
well it might have slightly different

156
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,599
recommendations as we just see here some

157
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,839
are for very small

158
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,720
some for very large operations we also

159
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,119
have different tank

160
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
sizes so keep that in mind however they

161
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,600
all work on the same

162
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,918
really basic concept where you have your

163
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
faucet you add that little fitting there

164
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:01,918
you attach your hose to the end of the

165
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,879
fitting

166
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,879
this little um

167
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,879
apparatus attaches to the tank and that

168
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
tank then can go through

169
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,279
and inject the fertilizer here keeping

170
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,639
in mind it's not under constant pressure

171
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,478
don't let it freeze

172
