1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,299
okay here we are look at a cannabis

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,429
mother room which is where the mother

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:06,839
plants are stocked plants are kept try

4
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:09,240
to put these pictures here to kind of

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,740
give in to like a County Fair there's a

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,719
birthing center handing the mother

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,669
producing many offspring here so you see

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,349
little nice little piglets this is kind

9
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:18,448
of like all the nice little clones that

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,090
ideally that one mother or stock plant

11
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,090
will produce to go on into the other

12
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,859
stages of growth and development so the

13
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,390
basics of a mother room this is again

14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,650
where the stock plants are kept and you

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,960
want to consider putting plants in

16
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,058
larger containers typically this means

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,829
seven gallon or greater seven to ten is

18
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,530
typically what most people keep their

19
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,359
mother plants in so this allows them to

20
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,189
be grown for the full year and it's a

21
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,009
full calendar year without becoming

22
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,320
really highly pot bÃ¡lint often this

23
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,329
mother room or stock room while it may

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,759
contain many plants or it could be a mix

25
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,378
of genetics this is often off-limits to

26
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,780
visitors because it contains potentially

27
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,878
rare and unique genetics keep in mind

28
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,590
you're restricting that area because if

29
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,689
you have that mother plant there's a

30
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,780
reason why that's a mother plant it has

31
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:06,118
a unique genetic set or it's a unique

32
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,590
cross or something different than the

33
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,978
vast majority of plants that you may

34
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,100
have lighting of a mother room plants

35
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:16,618
will be in here and will be in the

36
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,509
vegetative state so looking at 16 hours

37
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,009
plus of continuous light is important

38
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,930
fluorescents will not produce enough

39
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,719
penetrating light so they shouldn't be

40
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,820
used ceramic metal halides or metal

41
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,099
halides are a good place to start

42
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,309
this is a ceramic metal halide this can

43
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,750
also be used for propagation purposes so

44
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,939
again it can be using the same light

45
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,978
potentially for multiple purposes or at

46
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,658
least the same fixture that you could be

47
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:42,239
running in slightly different ways and

48
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,649
reducing your amount of just difference

49
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,469
that you have it streamlining the

50
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,430
process a little bit more a health and

51
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:49,408
feeding of a mother plant

52
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,970
remember plants will be full-sized and

53
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,920
potentially older so keeping them in

54
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,868
good health is important they can easily

55
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,009
become stressed fertilizing is often

56
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:58,049
required but watching that happen

57
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,549
nitrogen you add as this will reduce the

58
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,090
ease of rooting those cuttings in the

59
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,130
future

60
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,009
inspect the roots you can see here nice

61
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:06,810
intensive root system good vegetative

62
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,598
growth a lot of branches a lot of great

63
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,039
clone opportunities here but if you over

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,769
feed this with nitrogen it will reduce

65
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,049
the rooting there's clone

66
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,550
so you want to be mindful of that to try

67
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,510
to keep everything as healthy and

68
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,510
efficient as possible
