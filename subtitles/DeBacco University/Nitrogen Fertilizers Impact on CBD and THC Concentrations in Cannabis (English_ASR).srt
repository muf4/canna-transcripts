00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
welcome to this debacco University video

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,240
we're going to be going over nitrogen

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,280
fertilizer impact on CBD and THC

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,919
concentrations in cannabis giving you an

5
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:14,079
indication of how much nitrogen

6
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,240
fertilizer you should be giving and what

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,079
might be too much and what are the

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,109
negative effects by giving too much

9
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,159
nitrogen

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,160
[Music]

11
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:30,839
fertilizer all right let's get into the

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,480
video here now the this is the research

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,200
article so if you want to find out some

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,000
more information about this or look at

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,160
some more of materials and methods

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,039
you're more than welcome to Via the link

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,639
provided here but I'm going to give you

18
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,960
a general summary and kind of give you a

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,399
grower Viewpoint of this so uh kind of

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,520
most important here is the actual

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,359
research trials uh that they did and the

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,879
results that they got so looking at the

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,600
uh graphs that we see over here note

24
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,878
that the total biomass and total

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,198
cannaboid concentrations in percent dry

26
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:03,358
weight are on the Y AIS the vertical

27
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,840
axis and this is versus the measured

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,159
nitrogen concentrations in percent dry

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,520
weight that'll be on the xaxis here it's

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,359
kind of what you're looking at they have

31
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,438
some correlation lines now the

32
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,079
Triangular points you see kind of here

33
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,118
and here identify plants in the north

34
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,438
and west facing edge of the glass house

35
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:21,519
and that's where these plants were grown

36
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,438
as part of this study uh we're

37
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,118
considered above the regression line as

38
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,719
we can see here the regression line is

39
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,599
here uh an average had higher values

40
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,078
than the dot points and the dot points

41
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,478
are those little circles and those dot

42
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,919
points in the same grass were indicated

43
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,719
plants not on the edges so the triangle

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
plants uh here uh give you the idea that

45
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,798
those were on the sun Edge and the

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,240
circles were not on the sun Edge so this

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,439
also speaks to the importance of light

48
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,118
and concentration of light the intensity

49
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,158
of light your plants are getting how

50
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,200
that can influence things as well they

51
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,520
took that into consideration here now

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,079
looking at the general Trend we could

53
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,000
see that biomass in grams here is

54
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:00,679
increasing uh which is you know everyone

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,438
thinks that'd be better bigger quote

56
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,320
better plants however we'll notice as

57
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,559
the biomass increase we see all these

58
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,639
other regression lines going the

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,039
opposite direction and those are looking

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:15,039
at total uh CBC total CBD and total THC

61
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,519
there's a negative correlation there

62
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,560
they also a little study on pruning I'm

63
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:20,120
going to focus more here on the nitrogen

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,560
uh treatments as

65
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,560
well now as I say it's an inverse

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,719
relationship here so the increase in

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,120
biomass is nitrogen concentration

68
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,598
increased from 3 to 6 was approximately

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,120
100% in this is why you want to be

70
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:33,959
careful of the scales so if you look at

71
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,200
the y-axis just to go back for a second

72
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,840
here we could see biomass in grams is

73
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,158
100 to 200 this is like doubling in size

74
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,200
here just to give you a little bit of

75
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:44,479
idea what those numbers actually

76
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,719
mean however the corresponding decrease

77
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,919
as I pointed out in the cannaboid

78
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,639
concentration was approximately

79
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,199
67% this entails a net decline in yields

80
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,839
in terms of grams as nitrogen

81
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,359
concentration increases so as you get

82
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,080
excessive in nitrogen and that comes

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,360
higher and higher your cannabic content

84
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,239
is canabo concentration is decreasing

85
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,519
that's the little brackets mean here and

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,719
I saw example of the Seesaw here because

87
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,840
as nitrogen's going up it's an inverse

88
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,000
relationship the canab concentration is

89
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,920
decreasing which of course Growers don't

90
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,080
want to have so kind of your general key

91
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,839
points is that biomass was strongly and

92
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,360
positively related to nitrogen

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,000
fertilizer canab concentrations were

94
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,720
strongly negative related to nitrogen uh

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,878
and plants in the sun Edge tended to

96
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,239
have higher biomass levels in

97
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,039
cannabinoid cont concentrations compared

98
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,039
to those grown in the row now those High

99
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,079
nitrogen levels those High nitrogen

100
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,519
those nutrients raised in those High

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,879
nitrogen um levels in both the

102
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,280
inflorescence the flower and also the

103
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,000
leaf plant matter for very high levels

104
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,318
of nitrogen nutrition which is defined

105
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,840
as 500 milligrams per milliliter

106
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:54,158
influence in cannabid concentrations

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,239
decrease significantly with little

108
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:59,919
change in total biomass and leaf biomass

109
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,680
also increased quite a bit with higher

110
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,598
nitrogen supplied stem diameter also

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,879
increased this is a sign of kind of a

112
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,000
nitrogen bloat Growers may say to their

113
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,399
plant and the net effect of increasing

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,959
nitrogen nutrition on the total yield of

115
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,079
canids was negative because of the

116
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,238
increase in biomass which was also which

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,879
was only significant in the leaves kind

118
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,879
of that extra giant growth you might

119
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,719
have on the leaves this was not enough

120
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,959
though to offset the conent decrease in

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
cannaboid concentrations so again we're

122
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,799
getting a little to these excessive

123
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,038
levels getting a bigger plant but

124
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,918
decreasing our total yields which is

125
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:36,839
what are not should should not be our

126
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,599
goal now looking at our canab

127
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,159
concentration as well as canid yield per

128
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,360
plant or decreased with the increased

129
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Supply so how do we kind of explain this

130
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,520
and this is kind of looking at a general

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,199
fertilizer curve so as we get our

132
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,399
nutrient Supply as we go from left to

133
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,120
right we're getting more fertilizer and

134
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,079
on the y- axis here we looking get crop

135
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,519
yield higher yield being better well

136
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,879
there a certain point that if you are

137
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,079
growing in soil and don't add any

138
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,079
fertilizer you're going to get a certain

139
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,959
yield uh but of course is probably going

140
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,800
to be below what Growers are aiming for

141
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,120
so they add fertilizer now you can add

142
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,840
fertilizer and you have this kind of

143
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,918
initially almost a linear increase but

144
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,239
then it kind of like levels off it kind

145
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,799
of like reaches this kind of peak and

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,759
there's this maximum yield point now if

147
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,280
you keep adding fertilizer beyond that

148
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,759
maximum yield Point what ends up

149
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,679
happening is that you start to get a

150
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,960
decrease in return now you're increasing

151
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,038
your cost but you're going to decrease

152
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,599
on return that's what we're seeing here

153
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:29,839
the correlation with the nitrogen

154
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,400
fertilizer numbers

155
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,439
so very high concentrations of

156
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,638
fertilizer are not advised because of

157
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,959
lower cannaboid concentration in yield

158
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,800
and then the optimum nitrogen nutrition

159
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,638
is likely between 60 and 120 milligrams

160
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,160
per liter I also did it here in ounces

161
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,360
per gallon and this is a range so it's a

162
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,400
pretty big range uh but it is a range so

163
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,840
you want to make sure you're definitely

164
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,638
not outside that range because you'll

165
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:56,318
try to get over to where that yield

166
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,600
curve is going down now pruning impact I

167
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,879
just wanted to mention it here that they

168
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,439
did a double spem pruning was applied as

169
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,879
an additional treatment to investigate

170
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,399
efficiency and biomass increase pruning

171
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,680
treatment did not increase cannaboid

172
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,679
concentration or affect biomass when

173
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,519
measured at the final Harvest so I just

174
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,439
wanted to make note of that it was on

175
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,719
the graphs that we saw earlier now study

176
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,038
also evaluated the sun Edge uh plants I

177
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,039
wanted to just touch on that because

178
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,399
across all treatments as an artifact of

179
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,318
this trial Sun Edge plants were the most

180
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,279
directly exposed to sunlight showed a

181
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,360
trend towards more biomass and higher

182
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,519
cannaboid concentrations according to

183
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,919
the model that they did statistics wise

184
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,079
self- shading of plants can limit the

185
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,399
production of cannaboids so it's

186
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,159
important to consider plant density and

187
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,839
light intensity and also the Spectrum

188
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,960
your plants are receiving for those

189
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,198
growing indoors however these results

190
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,159
can only be considered preliminary

191
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,759
because in it warrants further research

192
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,680
but just showing you for those growing

193
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,759
maybe indoors how can we relate this

194
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,360
study that we want to really make sure

195
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,080
we're getting high par to our plants uh

196
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,360
and across all areas as we saw a

197
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,680
dramatic effect here with the sun Edge

198
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,000
plants versus those growing in row how

199
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,439
that can affect things so it's more than

200
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,240
just nitrogen but that is important

201
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,598
consideration you don't want to over add

202
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,319
it because you'll Simply Be reducing

203
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,639
your yields and increasing your costs so

204
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,400
hopefully that's helpful there's other

205
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,199
videos on this channel about nitrogen

206
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,959
fertilizer but this gives you another

207
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,960
study to investigate
