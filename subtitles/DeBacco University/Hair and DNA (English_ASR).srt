00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,639
welcome to another video here on tobacco

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,000
university

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,800
in this video we're going to be looking

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,120
at hair in its relation to dna

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,120
you can see here's a long braided hair

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,640
and here is the double helix

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,079
of dna now dna analysis is only possible

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,760
if the bulb

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,839
at the base of the hair is intact so

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,560
keep in mind that bulb region is down

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,518
here

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,038
closer to the root end of the hair the

13
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,079
hair bubble foams at the base of the

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,160
hair follicle

15
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,358
and in the hair bulb living cells divide

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,439
and grow to build

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,840
the hair shaft this is why it's

18
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,519
important for dna analysis

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
because the blood vessels that nurse the

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,640
cells in the hair bulb deliver more

21
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,359
hormones that modify hair growth and

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,359
structure

23
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,200
at different times so that can be useful

24
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,280
in addition those growing cells

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,239
are more likely to contain that

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,320
important

27
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,799
dna when we're looking at trying to take

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,439
care which is a class characteristic

29
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,878
and trying to get it more in the chance

30
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,280
of being in the individual

31
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:02,238
characteristic category

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,960
so here at different growth stages keep

33
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,438
in mind

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,000
that advancements in dna profiling can

35
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,639
now

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,319
individualize human hair the probability

37
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,799
of detecting dna at the hair roots is

38
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,519
more likely for hair being examined

39
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,720
in different growth phases and here we

40
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,719
have the different growth

41
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,478
phases so here we have the early growth

42
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,039
phase which is also referred to as the

43
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:22,798
antigen

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,560
phase then we have the middle growth

45
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,000
phase that's the catagen phase and then

46
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,359
the telogen phase which is the

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,319
final phase here

48
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,759
now here in dna specifically when hair

49
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,239
is forcibly removed

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,680
often a follicle tag which is a

51
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,559
transition piece of tissue surrounding

52
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,799
the hair shaft

53
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
may be present and it kind of looks like

54
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,000
this right here this is a root with a

55
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,759
follicle tag

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,280
other surrounded by tissue this will

57
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,359
have nuclear

58
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,879
dna and this is proven to be a rich

59
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,759
source of that nuclear dna associated

60
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,959
with the hair

61
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,280
keep in mind if you're finding a hair

62
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,959
piece without that follow the

63
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,718
the follicular tag here the root is club

64
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,078
shaped there's going to be basically

65
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,679
no nuclear dna located here so this is

66
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,158
kind of the goldmine here for finding

67
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,200
that

68
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,560
dna you have those cells around that

69
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,719
kind of root of the of the hair

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,640
looking at hair in the mitochondrial dna

71
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,400
so mitochondrial dna is found outside

72
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,759
the nucleus and is transmitted only from

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,360
the mother to child

74
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,919
so ideally nuclear dna is what we want

75
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,120
to find but mitochondrial dna should not

76
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,799
be overlooked

77
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,878
because mitochondrial dna can be

78
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,360
extracted from the hair shaft

79
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,079
as a rule all positive microscopic hair

80
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,560
comparisons

81
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,640
must be confirmed by dna analysis so

82
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
again why the mitochondrial dna may only

83
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,878
be tied to the maternal line

84
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,679
still can be important information it

85
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,120
can still help

86
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,879
eliminate potential suspects on a list

87
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
to try to get to that more individual

88
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,079
characteristic

89
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,679
now when we're collecting here as a

90
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
baseline and ideally

91
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,439
the general rule forensics hair

92
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,480
comparisons involve either head hair or

93
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,158
pubic hair

94
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,919
so ahead here ideally we're looking to

95
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,679
collect about 50 full length

96
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,039
ahead here samples from all areas of the

97
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,719
scalp will normally ensure a

98
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,878
representative sample

99
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,400
to be care we're looking at about 24

100
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:09,280
full-length pubic hairs or

101
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,439
should cover the range of

102
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,120
characteristics present in pubic hair

103
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,959
hair samples should also be collected

104
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,158
from victims or suspicious deaths during

105
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,360
an autopsy

106
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,679
so a lot of times if you're just

107
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,680
investigating um a crime scene without a

108
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,560
body you may find hair samples

109
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,760
but it may be difficult to find 50 but

110
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,959
if you're looking at particularly an

111
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,598
autopsy or have the

112
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,080
ability to collect hair and have access

113
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,798
to 50 head hair samples or 24 pubic hair

114
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,159
samples

115
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,080
those would definitely be advised

116
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,798
because it would help determine

117
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
uh or reduce the natural range of hair

118
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,680
variability

119
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,280
to allow you to kind of get a little bit

120
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,239
more closer to that individual

121
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,598
characteristic

122
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,719
when we're looking at identifying

123
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,719
different hair samples
