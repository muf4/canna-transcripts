00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,560
here on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,359
going to go over how to identify

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,359
and control grasshoppers on cannabis

4
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:16,239
[Music]

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,679
plants

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,519
all right let's get into how

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,439
identification and controlling of

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,239
grasshoppers on cannabis plants

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920
we can see here here's one actively on a

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,479
cannabis leaf there

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,560
looking to probably uh conduct some sort

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,119
of damage to that plant

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,759
so that description of the grasshoppers

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,839
well they're

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,519
visually distinctive compared to many

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,320
other insects

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,879
the cultivated gardeners don't seem to

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,520
be

19
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,119
kind of a common sight for egg egg if

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,920
you're growing in a cultivated garden

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,839
may not see as many of them grasshoppers

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,440
tend to prefer undisturbed areas

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
such as pasture areas if you're growing

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,839
cannabis on a larger scale

25
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,000
might have a better odds of seeing it

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,160
particularly if it's next to a large

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,159
pasture area populations may vary

28
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,358
considerably also from year to year so

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,399
keep that in mind

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,680
because you didn't see them last year

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,960
doesn't mind you don't see them a lot

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
this year

33
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,000
there's different types of grasshoppers

34
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,599
and there's many

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
many different types try to provide a

36
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,319
general kind of visual guide just right

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,320
here

38
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,079
with all of them listed as well as some

39
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,798
additional resources here

40
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,560
provided by the usda the presence of

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,479
weeds and hemp plantings that support

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
various grasshoppers can increase the

43
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,359
likelihood of this pest pressure

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
on hemp crops so that managing of area

45
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,640
and local weeds

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,400
is important to reduce their population

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,680
so they're less likely to jump to the

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,280
cannabis plants

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
some grasshoppers specialize on certain

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
weedy plants and hemp

51
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,560
is not their target plant species so

52
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,239
hopefully they'll just kind of be a

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,159
graze feeder and a nuisance

54
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,920
more than actual leading to crop

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,840
complete failure

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,359
now the feeding and identification of

57
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
that feeding of grasshoppers if you're

58
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,359
seeing some damage on your plants

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,439
grasshoppers do tend to be stem feeders

60
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,640
and this poses the greatest threat to

61
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,398
the cannabis plants

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,239
you can see here gnawing down the stem

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
breaking the stem causing that kind of

64
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,478
top to fall over

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,239
leaf chewing is a common injury as well

66
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,840
but it occurs on the stems that can

67
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,878
stunt the plant that can cause it to

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,239
fall over

69
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,479
that can cause longer term implications

70
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,239
and negative implications at that

71
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,919
so how do we manage grasshoppers well

72
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,080
control can be difficult while physical

73
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,598
barriers can offer some protection

74
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,040
grasshoppers have been known to chew

75
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,079
through protective materials such as

76
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,519
insect netting

77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
if you really want to get in there and

78
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
they're really determined they can

79
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,120
however chickens aren't excellent

80
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,959
natural predators but they can often do

81
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,439
unintentional damage to your plants as

82
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
well

83
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,318
so it's that kind of risk reward aspect

84
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,080
chickens are great for removing

85
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,439
grasshoppers maybe not necessarily in

86
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
your canvas plants but maybe in those

87
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,039
neighboring weeds or pasture areas

88
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,959
let them kind of free range in that area

89
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,039
to help control the population

90
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,719
there so it's a reduced amount of

91
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,560
grasshoppers that could make it

92
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,560
to your cannabis plants
