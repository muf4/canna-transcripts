00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,318
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,878
going to go over post-harvest cannabis

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:09,120
plant disposal as it's something indoor

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:16,509
growers as well as outdoor growers

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:19,519
need to take into consideration

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,960
[Music]

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,879
all right let's get into post harvest

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,320
cannabis plant disposal

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,919
so first off want to think about the

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
post harvest waste

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
since the goal is to only harvest the

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,800
buds there is a lot of plant biomass

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
that is not needed

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,239
and becomes waste products and this is

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,840
speaking to plants

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,279
that we're not looking at producing kind

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
of fiber for

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,239
growers need to keep this in mind as to

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,399
also have this as a plan for disposing

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,558
of this excess of plant material it's

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,679
really the only end goal result

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,359
is the actual buds and flowers and the

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,479
leaves may be immediately surrounding

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,878
those

25
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,718
so keep in mind this is more than just

26
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,320
plants yes the plants are a source of

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,399
waste but you also need to consider

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,840
other plant supporting materials this

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,280
may depend on your growing situation

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,040
again with your indoor grower

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,118
or an outdoor grower but regardless

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
growty to take into account all plant

33
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,118
material and supporting plant material

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,720
into consideration when it comes to

35
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,359
waste disposal

36
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,319
now for indoor operations indoor

37
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,679
operations

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,438
have some situations that are not

39
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
present for outdoor growing plants for

40
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,158
example

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,519
indoor growers have to consider how

42
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,560
they're going to dispose of their

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,959
containers

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
this substrate that they might be using

45
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,599
as well as the lights

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,359
such as the bulbs and ballast that they

47
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,919
might be using and i'll have a separate

48
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,000
video

49
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
i've really focused on indoor growing

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,478
operations

51
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,478
now for outdoor growing operations

52
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,599
they're not immune either to considering

53
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,280
harvest disposal

54
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,640
outdoor growing operations have some

55
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,519
situations that are not present for

56
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,280
indoors

57
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,759
they a lot of times have weed control

58
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,599
products such as plastics for example

59
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,280
it to be disposed of irrigation

60
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,478
equipment also an important

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,200
consideration

62
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,599
for items that will need to be disposed

63
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,960
of

64
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,199
so if you're an outdoor grower of a

65
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,438
separate video on that but keep in mind

66
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,320
in both situations indoor and outdoor

67
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,078
there are

68
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,359
post harvest disposal methods post

69
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,959
harvest waste products

70
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,560
that growers need to be mindful and

71
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,159
considerate of

72
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,759
when they're trying to implement some

73
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,479
sort of growing practice so they don't

74
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,519
get caught

75
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,840
the end of the season with a large

76
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,840
area to dispose of a large volume of

77
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,200
material outside of the plants that they

78
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,200
may not have considered
