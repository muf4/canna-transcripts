1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
okay here we're gonna look at the

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,878
digestive process and this is in general

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,510
the process of breaking down the food

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,820
that we consume starting first with the

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:15,469
breakdown of carbohydrates in general

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,390
it's the starch converted into sugars a

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,670
polysaccharide being broken down by

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,368
salary a malaise no surprise in your

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,900
saliva breaking down our starches are

10
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,390
complex polysaccharide into some

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,948
disaccharides that then ultimately can

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,189
be broken down into monosaccharides

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,140
for example disaccharide sucrose sucrase

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,750
enzyme we'll break that down into one

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,079
monomer of glucose and one monomer of

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,899
fructose maltose multi-enzyme we'll

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,219
break that into two monomers of glucose

18
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:46,530
amylase is this enzyme that breaks down

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,450
carbohydrates it cannot break down fats

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,719
or proteins or anything else remember

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,280
enzymes are very specific continuing on

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,980
we have protein digestion and this

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,640
occurs in the stomach and duodenum three

24
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:04,259
main enzymes are secreted pepsin by the

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,299
stomach types in and kind of trypsin by

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,330
the pancreas so the pancreas is involved

27
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,220
with a lot of enzymes secreting them

28
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,438
into the intestines for the digestion

29
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,819
process to occur the end result is to

30
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,069
break down these proteins into amino

31
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,469
acids so here's our protein here's our

32
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,899
pepsin bring down two large polypeptides

33
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:24,569
short polypeptides and ultimately down

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,420
into amino acids you can also see some

35
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:29,489
of the general digestive processes that

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,579
are occurring protein digestion enzymes

37
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:35,280
are secreted in the brush border here

38
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:38,158
also our pancreas is secreting protein

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,810
digesting enzymes some also occurring in

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,060
the stomach by a simple hydrochloric

41
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,740
acid and the small intestine is the

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,359
major site protein digestion and the

43
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,699
final digestion occurs here in the small

44
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,469
intestine I'm not really a lot of

45
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,899
digestion occurs necessarily in the

46
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,269
large intestine see the small intestine

47
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,200
being the major site of our protein

48
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:57,420
digestion

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,939
again the liver regulates distribute of

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,420
amino acids to the rest of the body so a

51
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,919
very important organ continuing on the

52
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,489
general process so this gives you a good

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,659
pictorial here also color codes and we

54
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,520
could see kind of the blue squiggly

55
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,479
lines our propulsion that's a swallowing

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,730
and

57
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,019
kind of pushing of our food through then

58
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:17,840
we have our chemical digestion which

59
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,590
these little green raindrops and

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,479
mechanical digestion which is the

61
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,400
chewing that occurs in the mouth for

62
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,369
churning of the actual in the stomach

63
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,769
and also churning occurs in the small

64
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,330
intestine now deciding the orange we see

65
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:33,480
the absorption of nutrients water blood

66
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,300
vessels and vessels are all absorbing

67
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,399
these nutrients also water in the large

68
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,689
intestine is being absorbed the general

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,730
overview is to the cat eating the food

70
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,530
here is we're ingesting our food we're

71
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:45,389
digesting and breaking it down then

72
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,310
we're absorbing our food we're simply

73
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,859
and to be able to use to make cells in

74
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,019
various structures that our body needs

75
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,400
and ultimately we're removing unused

76
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:57,930
food in the feces the general structure

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,039
of the addition of organs that can spend

78
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,709
a lot of time on this but we have the

79
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,810
mucosa which is epithelium here in our

80
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,879
area sub mucosa which is the connective

81
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,098
tissue muscularis which is smooth

82
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,689
muscles a few things moving and sorrow

83
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:13,379
so just the connective tissue holding

84
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:15,299
everything in place the general path who

85
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,280
travel up into six easy steps even

86
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:19,889
though there's eight listed here the

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,539
mouth the esophagus the stomach then I

88
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,489
break apart I kind of ties in with this

89
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,379
the liver and the pancreas here in this

90
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,939
image it's broken apart we have our

91
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,859
small intestine our large intestine and

92
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,930
ultimately solid waste passes through

93
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:32,519
the anus so keep in mind this pathway

94
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,219
that food travels it's important to know

95
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,019
what occurs where and also what order

96
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:40,199
that it occurs because that's important

97
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,509
to all all the most efficient use of the

98
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,298
food we take in to convert it to energy

99
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:48,149
to be used for our body to allow us to

100
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,599
continue on living any normal and

101
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,599
healthy life
