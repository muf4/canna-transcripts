1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,559
interested in perching a cmh light of

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,879
your own well stay tuned here in this

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,638
debaco university video i'll be

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,480
i'll be comparing some of these light

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:17,920
fixtures so you can help make an

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,920
informed decision

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,240
let's look at comparison some cmh light

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,919
fixtures for cannabis production

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,839
so first off as a disclaimer i have not

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,439
received any financial compensation for

11
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,879
writing the following product review

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,399
i have no material connection to the

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,799
brand's products or services i have

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,439
mentioned

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,359
here so as a standard for comparison all

16
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,238
the lights will i'll be showing

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,640
are 630 watts each light will have the

18
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,359
good

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
the bad and recommendations provided for

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,600
it

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,079
so first off the sun systems lec boss

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,239
light

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,439
it's a great a great compact design can

24
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,839
dim each

25
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,960
bulb separately can produce eighty five

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,199
percent ppf

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
at two thousand twenty thousand hours

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,079
ninety-five percent

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,439
reflective interior the bad is of course

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,878
the price uh

31
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,518
recommendations is it does come

32
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,039
recommended uh it can be used in damp

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,280
locations again does that mean wet and

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,080
soggy conditions damp locations

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,840
it can be used there's also the growers

36
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,798
choice which has a range of bulb options

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,799
as a dimmable

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,560
ballast it is a bulkier reflector and

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
ballast design so not quite as efficient

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,920
as some of the other ones

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,560
it's a good entry level cmh grow light

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,799
if it's something you are considering

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,759
and lastly here just go kind of a quick

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,400
comparison

45
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,319
this is the demolux expert series 98

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,960
reflective aluminum reflector

47
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,599
seven dim levels streamlined design it's

48
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,519
only available in the 240 and 277

49
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,959
volt options and it's great for

50
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,879
commercial settings

51
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,199
so of these if i was to recommend only

52
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,199
one

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
um

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,439
so then we get to the demolux expert

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,399
series they're good about this as a 98

56
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,799
reflective aluminum reflector seven dim

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,919
levels in a streamlined design

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,120
it is only available though in 240 and

59
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,919
277 volt options

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,480
and it is great for commercial settings

61
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,079
we also have the gavita pro 630e

62
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,639
se it is available with the 930 aggro or

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,719
9

64
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,919
42 phillips lamps which have a very high

65
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,318
1.95

66
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,919
ppf per watt per second output which is

67
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,000
a great option to have

68
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,598
however the bad is that they're balanced

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,199
but vertically mounted

70
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,439
ballast here as we can see in the

71
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,560
picture doesn't make it great for low

72
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,639
restrictive ceiling

73
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,878
height grow spaces it is also only

74
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,359
available in the 208 or 240 volt

75
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,959
power options best suited for commercial

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
growing setup if this was a light you

77
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,680
were looking at implementing that is not

78
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,039
ceiling height limited then we get to

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
the nanolux

80
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,799
series module grow light system the

81
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,598
ballast can support a variety of light

82
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,879
types so it

83
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,280
actually can support hps high pressure

84
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,120
sodium mh metal halide or cmh

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,640
bulb options there's also different

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,439
reflector options growers can choose

87
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,199
from

88
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,199
the batter is kind of the dra the jack

89
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,919
of all trades but really the master of

90
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,759
none

91
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,598
so the recommendations would be great if

92
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,359
you want it for multiple uses

93
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,439
but for me light should be specialized i

94
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,840
want a dedicated light for a dedicated

95
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,598
purpose so if i was looking at all these

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,360
lights if i was to select one while the

97
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,759
decision would be difficult

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,519
i would select the demolux expert series

99
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,959
has a high quality reflector and a low

100
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,920
profile design

101
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,598
i will say in the smaller 315 watt i

102
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,000
have used both the dimelux

103
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,439
as well as the very first one mentioned

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,639
the sun systems

105
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,039
or sun systems boss there so for looking

106
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,958
here

107
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,400
another one the sun systems lac boss

108
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,280
light here both

109
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,599
very good lights i do like the low

110
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,199
profile design the balance design

111
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,039
but looking at the lights this one just

112
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,359
seems to be a little bit more refined

113
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,400
you are going to pay for it but if i was

114
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,080
to select one

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,080
it would be the deluxe expert series for

116
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,080
consideration
