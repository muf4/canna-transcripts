1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,359
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,519
going to be going over

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,439
rockwell size options for indoor

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,879
cannabis plant production it may be just

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,320
more than what you're thinking of

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,920
a lot of growers use rockwool at the

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,519
early stages but did you know

8
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,439
it can be used throughout the full grow

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,649
cycle here we're going to go over

10
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,339
some of those options

11
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,339
[Music]

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,160
all right let's explore some of the

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,239
options regard for rockwool for your

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,079
indoor cannabis plant production

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,000
so first off grodan stonewall or

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,160
rockwool here

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,920
many brands but this is a very popular

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,718
one when both commercial and hobby

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,200
growers

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,120
rocco is made from molten rock spun into

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,760
a cotton candy-like fiber

22
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,640
is then compressed into cubes blocks or

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,719
slabs

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,960
because it's man-made it does allow for

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,759
the freedom to be made into a variety of

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,679
shapes

27
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,359
rockwell can absorb nutrient solution

28
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,359
and help maintain aeration

29
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,960
which are both beneficial to the plant

30
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,960
on both the small scale

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
and also the large scale growth

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
production

33
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,239
so we want to look at the propagation

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,040
stages where people may be your growers

35
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,039
might be made

36
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,320
most familiar with rockwool seedling

37
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,600
startings and cubes are easily

38
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,399
transferred into blocks

39
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,158
and then into slabs if desired so that

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
makes it very advantageous

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,240
seedlings or cuttings started in grodan

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,520
cubes can be transplanted into more

43
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,519
traditional planters

44
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,959
or also growing mediums this is why

45
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,319
people might be familiar with rockwool

46
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,158
at the starter stage and they might

47
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,719
progress to other substrates

48
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,439
grodin makes ok starter plugs macro

49
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,840
plugs

50
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,719
and aok starter plugs just to give some

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
examples

52
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,400
there of the variety that you have even

53
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,759
in just the propagation stage of

54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,680
production

55
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,118
we get to growing blocks as we can see

56
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,399
here used quite a bit

57
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:49,280
and we see the clones here being grown

58
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,280
in the little starter plugs and then

59
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,759
they're placed directly into its form

60
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,239
fit

61
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,118
into the blocks here those seedlings or

62
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,280
cuttings started

63
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,799
in these larger growing blocks and once

64
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
rooted the blocks are then transferred

65
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,240
to long

66
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,920
a larger stonewall slab grow blocks can

67
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,359
also be planted directly into containers

68
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,439
for soil gardening

69
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,959
and this is a strip of four inch by four

70
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,639
inch grinding blocks each with

71
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,800
pre-formed holes in them

72
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,039
to accept those little starter plugs

73
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,959
there makes for a very easy transfer

74
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,280
makes for a very efficient transfer

75
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,000
and also a very time efficient transfer

76
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,318
as well with minimal root disturbance

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
now growing slabs growing slabs are used

78
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,280
in the final stage of planting these are

79
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,039
kind of the largest

80
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,759
these slabs come in clearly marked

81
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,719
uv-resistant poly sleeves for ease of

82
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,479
use

83
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,479
it's recommended for larger long-term

84
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,560
crops with extensive root structures

85
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,119
like cannabis peppers tomatoes or even

86
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,759
cucumbers typically seedlings and blocks

87
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,759
are

88
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,439
placed into the slabs as kind of the

89
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,719
next level of progression

90
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,159
in the grow cycle now lastly combining

91
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,639
the blocks in the slabs what does that

92
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,639
actually

93
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,159
kind of look like we can see some great

94
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,238
examples of that here

95
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,079
this allows for minimal root disturbance

96
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,800
as the two components naturally work

97
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,719
together

98
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
they're also the very similar material

99
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,158
so that's allowing those roots to kind

100
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,640
of go through and transfer from one to

101
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,280
the other

102
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,279
very easily

103
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,598
so the block can be placed directly on

104
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,239
the slab to allow the roots to continue

105
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,399
growing

106
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,480
from that block right into the slab we

107
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
see that here in the large production

108
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,280
we see that here kind of a zoomed in

109
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,878
version what does it look like from the

110
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,919
root standpoint well this is kind of a

111
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,120
great cutaway

112
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,359
we're seeing the roots that were

113
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,200
initially started in that block have now

114
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,799
progressed to and are starting to spread

115
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,158
throughout the slab they're allowing for

116
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,719
that expansion

117
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,318
this is why rockwell can be used from

118
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,080
the very start to the very end

119
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,839
because of the options that it provides

120
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,640
and the root friendly and plant

121
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,959
therefore

122
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,839
plant-friendly environment that it can

123
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,000
create

124
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,840
throughout the propagation stage all the

125
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,840
way to the final harvest stage
