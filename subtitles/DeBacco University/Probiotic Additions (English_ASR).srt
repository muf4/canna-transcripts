1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
okay here a look at some probiotic

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,740
editions commonly added to soil or to

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,808
plants to help protect them mycorrhizae

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,359
is this perilla root shield and

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,699
actinovate are some common ones we also

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,129
see this evident in like yogurts this

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:19,230
year so eager where see the use of

8
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:21,809
probiotics too so that there's some

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,689
beneficial microbes in this particular

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,640
product that has live cultures so first

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,439
off probiotics are beneficial microbes

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,778
adding microbes or life to your soil

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,308
some companies sell blend sbrick and get

14
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:33,270
a wide mix of microbes with one

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,429
application

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,950
other companies favor mono species by

17
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,079
trying to match a species with a

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,600
particular purpose so again you have to

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,350
look at some of the labels and some of

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,030
the of what they include so looking at

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,890
mycorrhizae for example this helps

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,170
increase root to soil surface area

23
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,609
interaction works best when plants are

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,600
grown in stressful conditions and

25
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,269
there's two different types of

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,370
mycorrhizae there's endo mycorrhizal

27
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,079
fungi which grows within the roots and

28
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,618
can form symbiotic relationships with

29
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,879
about 85% of terrestrial plant species

30
00:01:03,618 --> 00:01:09,269
African missus is kind of what Chilton

31
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:12,239
41 endo mycorrhizal fungi species

32
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:14,219
ectopic arezzo fungi live on the outside

33
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,839
of root cells and they're mainly form

34
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,629
relationships with conifers and other

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,490
hardwoods there remember that canvas is

36
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:22,560
an annual just want to be focusing here

37
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,679
on the endo mycorrhizal also your

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,060
Tomatoes your squash pepper plants can

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,500
also associate with endemic arise alumni

40
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,540
it's a semantic relationship that works

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,700
because the fungi provides increased

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,530
soil contact with the roots to benefit

43
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,400
the host plant so it's kind of this

44
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,019
inter relationship so the fungus here is

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,750
providing this increased web increased

46
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,728
interaction with the soil as in return

47
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,530
the fungi is able to get sugars from the

48
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,478
plant which is made in the upper leaf

49
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,219
structures so again this is kind of that

50
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,859
symbiotic relationship between these two

51
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:59,759
thumbs provides increased surface area

52
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:02,629
plant provides of sugars Aizaz beryllium

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,890
policier is a nitrogen fixing bacteria

54
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:06,599
it's often used in the early stages of

55
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,669
plant development so keep in mind that

56
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,439
this is a warm weather derived species

57
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,469
so apply it in cold soils wild little

58
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,729
benefit with bacteria

59
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,530
they can go through this very quick

60
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:18,389
exponential phase as temperature

61
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,819
increases and make sure they provide

62
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,589
with enough food and resources otherwise

63
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,870
we'll go through a very quick death day

64
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,310
it's quick to rise quick to fall I'm so

65
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,490
again in soil environments

66
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,349
this is typically associated with root

67
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,050
structures and again it will increase

68
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,400
with heat and heat of the soil so be

69
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,340
mindful of that that applying at the

70
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,200
cold soils will do a little good there's

71
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,420
also a product called root shield

72
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,099
Buechele plus it's made by Bioworks it

73
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:46,530
contains two active ingredients two

74
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,449
different strains of trichoderma Nickell

75
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,189
colonizes plant roots to help reduce the

76
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:52,079
chance of infection by a pathogen

77
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:54,210
these are granular in a winnable powder

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,610
the Grail is preferred due to the longer

79
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,370
shelf life in ease of application like

80
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,990
very very fine sand the wettable powder

81
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,810
cannot be run through drip irrigation

82
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,110
systems and has a shorter shelf life so

83
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,539
while they both have the same end our

84
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:11,010
active ingredient same end result the

85
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,229
grain there can be preferred simply

86
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:15,929
because of its longer shelf life it can

87
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:17,310
be easily mix into growing media lastly

88
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,180
we've act at innovate made by the

89
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:24,120
valiant it came to this streptomyces

90
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,890
particular microbe in it it does have

91
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,539
some supporting scientific documentation

92
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:30,269
swearing the ability to suppress disease

93
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,159
and can we run through drip irrigation

94
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,340
systems so this is kind of an

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,859
advantageous this particular fungus and

96
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,330
it's all of these can be very expensive

97
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,100
so you have to be mindful where they're

98
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,239
being used but I just want to give you

99
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,819
some ideas that some very common

100
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,259
probiotics that should be potentially

101
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,359
considered if you're having a problem

102
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:52,280
and you want to approach it in a

103
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,280
biological way
