1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
you might be familiar with dna structure

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,000
being this double helix

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,878
we're going to get into a little bit

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,679
more detail of just explaining the

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:09,279
structure

6
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,599
or what this is actually what are some

7
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,239
of the components that give dna

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,599
this double helical structure so

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,399
starting with the discovery of the

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,278
structure well

11
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,679
dna specifically is made of nucleotides

12
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,719
each nucleotide has a five carbon sugar

13
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,399
as we see here

14
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,879
there's a phosphate group which has a

15
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:30,159
negative charge and then an organic

16
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,919
base in this case based on nitrogen now

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,320
discovering the structure of dna there's

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,800
two main types or two classifications

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,799
of these nucleotides we have the large

20
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,599
bases the purines they're known as

21
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,718
adenine and guanine abbreviated with the

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,320
letter a and g

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,920
and we have acrymidines these are

24
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,719
smaller bases you notice these only have

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,640
one ring

26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
and the purines have two the permians

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,439
only have one ring

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,238
there's cytosine and thymine

29
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,920
assuming we're talking about dna for rna

30
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,479
we've got to remember uracil is only

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,559
found

32
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,959
in rna and thymine is only found in dna

33
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,798
cysteine is found in both now what's

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,079
important to remember is that a purine

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,240
will always bind with a pyrimidine

36
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,519
and we're going to see exactly how that

37
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,359
occurs

38
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,798
so our purine binding with this

39
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,920
pyrimidine how does this look

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,479
well here's an adenine with a thymine a

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
binds with t they have two hydrogen

42
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,920
bonds

43
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,040
between them g and c will bind together

44
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,759
guanine and

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,118
cytosine have three hydrogen bonds so

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,920
they hold their structure just a little

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,400
bit stronger

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,240
than between a and t how i try to

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,040
remember it is g and c both have these

50
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,959
kind of

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,400
semi-circle curves to them so they would

52
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,839
fit together very nicely

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,439
they have a stronger bond because they

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,680
have three hydrogen bonds

55
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,839
versus adenine and thymine only having

56
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
two keep in mind this is about dna so if

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
you look back for a second

58
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,798
adenine binding with thymine well adding

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000
would bind with uracil if we were

60
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,439
talking a double-stranded

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,438
rna which does occur now ribose compared

62
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,879
to deoxyribose so

63
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:04,879
look at the second carbon for h and oh

64
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,000
well this is kind of the area we're

65
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,280
looking at comparing

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,598
ribose with deoxyribose

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,878
so deoxys simply means without oxygen it

68
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,479
has just a hydrogen

69
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,799
ribose has an oh group now ribose stands

70
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,719
for

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
is responsible for rna which is

72
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,680
ribonucleic acid

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,759
deoxyribose dna deoxyribonucleic acid

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,719
so here with dna we see that kind of

75
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,359
second carbon there

76
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,199
deoxy without oxygen here's ribose with

77
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,560
oxygen we can see that oxygen

78
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,799
atom right here in the structure

79
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,959
now key observations about dna of

80
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,879
rosalind franklin uses x-ray diffraction

81
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,719
experiments to reveal that dna

82
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,719
had the shape of a coiled spring or a

83
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,039
helix this is kind of looking top

84
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,639
down at it you could see kind of that

85
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,159
coiled appearance we kind of put it in

86
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,598
that 3d rotation

87
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,719
but this image is kind of looking down

88
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:53,679
and this kind of gave the first

89
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,840
indication

90
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,800
that dna may be this spring look or this

91
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,080
kind of helical

92
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,640
shape watson and crick at the

93
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,200
al the accolades for kind of developing

94
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,359
the double helix official structure

95
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,719
though they based a lot of it off of

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,760
rosin franklin's

97
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,598
research so watson and crick kind of

98
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,239
came up with this idea and they used

99
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,318
kind of

100
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,280
finger toy models to kind of develop

101
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,679
this structure

102
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,680
that it was this helical shape this

103
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,000
double helix component

104
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
now two strands of dna are held together

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,158
by weak hydrogen bonds

106
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
and they have complementary pairs so as

107
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,239
you mentioned

108
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,239
appearing in a pyrimidine binding

109
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,640
together those are examples of

110
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,840
complementary base pairs a binds with t

111
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,079
and g binds with c those are

112
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,920
complements to one another we see that

113
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,239
here g binding with c and a binding with

114
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,039
t

115
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,080
two bonds and three hydrogen bonds now

116
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,679
when i talk about that

117
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,599
complement we're talking about the

118
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,680
original sequence and the other sequence

119
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,359
well it is not an identical sequence

120
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,000
it's a complement a binds with t

121
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,840
t binds with a a minor t g and c this is

122
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
what i mean by when i say a complement

123
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,878
e chain is complementary or a mirror

124
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,640
image of one another

125
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,959
so either can be used as a template when

126
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,199
a dna goes to

127
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,080
produce itself again to replicate that

128
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,280
process of

129
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,560
replication now working with dna there's

130
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,239
many different ways

131
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,798
scientists will work with dna just a

132
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
couple there's pcr plus chain reaction

133
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,679
amplification where

134
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,519
we're up regulating a small section of

135
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,639
dna to be used and run through

136
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,478
potentially a gel

137
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,400
and dna fingerprinting used to identify

138
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,758
particular individuals or specific

139
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,198
sequences

140
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,199
within a genome
