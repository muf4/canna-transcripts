00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,318
on this debaco university video just

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,080
going to go over cannabis information

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:09,599
sharing in a very brief sense and hope

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,599
that you do share this channel with

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,320
[Music]

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,519
others

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,920
all right let's get into cannabis

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,519
science information sharing so first off

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,640
realize that there are limited

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,399
uh published studies regarding cannabis

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,080
however the advantages it looks like

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,000
we're going to be on the increase

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,678
and this is mainly been due to the

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,079
restriction of the ability for federal

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,960
money to be used to spend on research

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,640
due to the classification of cannabis

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,039
many current studies being published

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,280
with

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,039
more being released on a continual basis

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,920
which will help improve the overall

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,640
education

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
and information set going forward it's

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,079
been said here

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,159
that more cannabis research will be done

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,799
and published in 2021

26
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,718
so the hope is that this rise in

27
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,439
information will give rise to more

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,439
detailed information and allow to kind

29
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,558
of the exponential increase

30
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,200
of the information to be spread and

31
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,959
gained and hopefully benefits to people

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,320
all over the world

33
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,478
now if you're looking at doing your own

34
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,399
research and don't have an expensive lab

35
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,000
want to see what other scientists are

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,118
doing well if you've got a computer and

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
you're watching this

38
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,560
great research to search for scientific

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,360
based articles

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,200
is google scholar google's great

41
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,560
starting point but google scholar allows

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
you to really research some of those

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,159
scientific articles which can really

44
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,719
make things

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,479
really get into the details and where a

46
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,519
lot of the other information you read

47
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:40,400
is really originated from

48
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,798
the hope just in general the hope is

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,478
that sharing quality information

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,880
is very important and hopefully that

51
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,840
will continue this channel tobacco

52
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,920
university's

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,320
main goal is to provide just that

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
scientific based information

55
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,919
and in return hope is that you're able

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,040
to share this channel with others to

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
help bridge the

58
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,719
knowledge gap to spread some information

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,640
to put kind of in the comments which you

60
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,399
might want to see in other videos

61
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,079
a new and interesting article you may

62
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,318
have found and hope that we can

63
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,598
build and continue building this

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,439
community here

65
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,359
to help education which will help

66
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,359
everyone in the long run
