1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,198
so this channel focuses a lot on

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,719
different pruning methods and you can

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,560
research a lot of options

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,080
but ever wonder what happens if you

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:08,879
really chose not to prune your cannabis

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,359
plants

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,920
this video here at tobacco university

8
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,919
will help give you some information on

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
that

10
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,880
[Music]

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,880
all right let's get into not pruning

12
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,198
chemist plants and see what impact that

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,679
has

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,359
on production so first off you have the

15
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,599
untouched growth habit we can see

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,800
image right here unpruned or untrained

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,238
chemist plants grow like

18
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,159
a christmas tree basically kind of that

19
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,439
nice triangular shape

20
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,878
at the time of flowering this will

21
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,238
typically mean the plants will have a

22
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,238
dense leaf canopy

23
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,078
with minimal light penetration into the

24
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,078
plant to the inner portions

25
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,759
this results in smaller and typically

26
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,520
weaker branches and buds

27
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,799
lower and deeper in the plant canopy

28
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,600
because they're simply not getting a lot

29
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,959
of light

30
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,120
these small buds that may be called

31
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,439
popcorn due to their small and minimal

32
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,280
density characteristics

33
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,198
so this gets into the great debate of

34
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,920
are you looking for quantity are you

35
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,239
looking for

36
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,680
quality so while it is possible for buds

37
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,600
to develop with less light

38
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,680
it can come down to quantity versus

39
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,759
quality there is not a simple x amount

40
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,600
of light equals x amount of ripening

41
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,159
partially shaded buds can still produce

42
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,199
quality buds just may not be the highest

43
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,478
quality

44
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
however this style of growing will

45
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,159
increase the amount of popcorn buds

46
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,839
which are smaller sized and typically

47
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,400
have lower densities we see in this

48
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
image

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,118
compared to what's determined to be a

50
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,118
higher quality bud located right here

51
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,359
now if we're not going to be pruning

52
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,359
that's that's one option for growers

53
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,959
but even if you don't plan on that

54
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,078
pruning method growers should still be

55
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,679
going through removing

56
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,438
yellow leaves to reduce the chance of

57
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,118
disease or insect

58
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,118
and have them kind of placed to

59
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,438
initially become established

60
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,159
so what we're trying to do is remove

61
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,239
some leaves

62
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,920
even if we're not pruning simply because

63
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,920
some of the leaves could create a

64
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,359
starting point for disease to start or

65
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,478
insects to start which would affect not

66
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,478
only the entire plant

67
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,159
but any neighboring plants so even if

68
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,118
you're not going to go through and prune

69
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
selective defoliation is still advised

70
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,000
and it helps you kind of

71
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,000
inspect the plants individually catch

72
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
any problems that might arise

73
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,759
very early on so you can implement

74
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,959
corrective measures that will have the

75
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,079
maximum chance

76
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,080
of effectiveness
