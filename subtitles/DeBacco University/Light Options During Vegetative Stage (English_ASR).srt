1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,509
okay here we're looking at a nice lineup

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,989
of lighting options that we can use

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:08,820
during the vegetative growth phase so

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,669
starting with a nice picture here

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,379
there's no one set light for vegetative

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:15,838
propagation or really any stage of the

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,278
growth per se many options can still be

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,649
successful in the vegetative state

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,629
probably offers the most opportunities

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,489
for different types of lights the key

11
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:25,230
that won't in the vegetative state is a

12
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:27,868
duration of lighting that you're using

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,939
how long or what's the photo period the

14
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,980
plants are being exposed to in general

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,289
lights can cover slightly more during

16
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,270
the vegetative phase than the flowering

17
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:37,619
state so just keep that in mind that if

18
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,540
you're looking at the square footage of

19
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,738
lights covered in the vegetative look at

20
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,019
transferring that over to the flower

21
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:45,869
maybe the cover slightly more area at

22
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,219
the vegetative state fluorescent lights

23
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,619
while these may be beneficial for

24
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,359
propagation overall the power readings

25
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,669
of these are not able to meet the

26
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,988
demands of a growing plant since these

27
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,370
eyes must be kept very close to the

28
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,948
leaves it can limit the coverage area

29
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,349
and also the penetration of light sorry

30
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:03,030
this was great for propagation or early

31
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,250
on and you can see some other lights

32
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,689
here in the background for more the true

33
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,450
growing phases when the plants get

34
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,559
bigger HPS are high pressure sodium czar

35
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,960
commonly used throughout the flowering

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,700
phase light but can also be used edge of

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,789
educated light as we see the plants here

38
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,890
if used as a vegetative phase keep an

39
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,659
eye on the distance your plants are from

40
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,189
the light you may want actually try to

41
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,020
keep it around at least that two feet

42
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:27,209
distance to ensure maximum power to the

43
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,280
plants does help reduce the tendency of

44
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,798
stretch so some people put them very far

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,379
away because of the natural spectrum

46
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,180
HBS's produce it can induce a little bit

47
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,280
more stretching so if you keep them a

48
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,170
little bit closer or right kind of at

49
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,629
that minimum distance you can help

50
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,399
reduce the chance of those straps as a

51
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:46,289
result I suggest you put them on those

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,040
ratchet hinders or strongly advised to

53
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,360
ally to keep kind of changing the

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,250
distance that the lights are from the

55
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,188
ceiling maintaining that two feet from

56
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,170
the planet CMA chasers from ceramic

57
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:01,709
metal halides a great choice for the veg

58
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,540
phase this is 215 here and this is a

59
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,179
double-ended bulb here so there's over

60
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,590
600 watts just in this one light it's

61
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,689
close to the spectrum of natural

62
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,469
sunlight and this also produces UV light

63
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:14,969
it's a very efficient partout watt ratio

64
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,069
these are both very efficient lights in

65
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,599
this category they run cooler compared

66
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,629
to other HID lights the both has a

67
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,060
relatively long a lifespan about 20,000

68
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:26,909
hours and still producing 80% of its

69
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,990
original out-of-the-box rating you

70
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,060
should purchase everything though as a

71
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,980
unit even if it cost a little bit more

72
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,439
because these can have very specific

73
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,000
requirements the bulbs may not get along

74
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,500
with different ballasts so a lot of

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,479
companies now are selling them all as

76
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,490
one unit and that would be advised to

77
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,929
purchase everything together so you're

78
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,879
ensuring that everything works with one

79
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,560
another

80
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,060
LEDs are light emitting plasmas while

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,400
they do produce a quality spectrum do

82
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,409
the cost of these in the competition of

83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,860
ceramic metal halides and during the

84
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:57,750
market there's slight advantages but

85
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,370
overall it's overshadowed by the overall

86
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,919
cost of these compared to ceramic metal

87
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,990
halides as a result most growers are

88
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,500
shifting over to the use of more ceramic

89
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,689
metal halides and phasing out LEDs

90
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,879
lastly LED is a great option for all

91
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:14,819
phases of growth all LD lights though

92
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,519
are not the same there's currently great

93
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,109
variance within this category quality

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,319
LED lights that have all the benefits

95
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,850
are often cost prohibitive so the better

96
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,319
ones can be more expensive and the

97
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,209
cheaper ones to not to be quite as good

98
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,099
as we thought should be considered as an

99
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,379
option look compared currently to

100
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,379
ceramic metal halides for grow operation

101
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,840
do they offers many of the same benefits

102
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:39,659
but they can be at reduced cost to run

103
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,580
reduced heat but that upfront cost may

104
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,579
make them out of reach for some growers
