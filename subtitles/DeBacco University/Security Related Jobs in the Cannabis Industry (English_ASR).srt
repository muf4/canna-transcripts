00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
here in this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,040
we're going to be looking at security

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,120
related jobs

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,800
and their connection to the cannabis

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,879
industry if you're considering to

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,990
pursuing this as a potential career

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:20,000
going forward

8
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:22,159
[Music]

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,198
so as you might imagine anything with

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,278
value

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,240
needs security and this is security

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:31,359
related jobs within the canvas industry

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,439
so first off the general job description

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,039
well as a security director you want to

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,159
establish and maintain a safe

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,280
secure and access controlled environment

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,319
for employees

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,000
as well as customers this creates and

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,079
they are also responsible for

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,119
creating and enforcing security

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,200
procedures

22
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,718
now this access control doesn't mean you

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,440
completely lock it up and no one can get

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,960
in or out

25
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,718
or make sure you have access control

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,600
knowing who's coming in knowing when

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,120
they're leaving

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
and making sure and having a check

29
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,119
system for those that aren't coming in

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,759
are authorized to be in

31
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,198
to the facility or growing area so this

32
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,759
day-to-day activities

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,920
overseas the access control system and

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,960
video monitoring systems a lot of video

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,320
monitoring is going on a lot of

36
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,399
recording as well

37
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,399
it determines employee access procedures

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,240
and they also ensure that

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
credential employees have access to

40
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,839
certain areas

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
if you're particularly in a propagation

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,759
area you don't need necessary access to

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,599
the

44
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,439
flower room or the drying room if you're

45
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,199
a particularly large operation

46
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,478
are responsible for the upkeep of all

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,880
secure equip

48
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,078
security equipment develops customer

49
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,239
policies to prevent

50
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,679
theft as well and conduct security

51
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,359
audits to make sure everything is

52
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,000
checking out on a continual basis

53
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,879
and reports security breaches if one is

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,239
determined

55
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,158
they're also responsible for collecting

56
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,118
document processing and disposing

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,840
uh deposits of all payments as well the

58
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,478
money

59
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,200
as well as the product need both to be

60
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,239
monitored

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,280
and secure so quality persons must have

62
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,239
if you're looking at

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,920
becoming a security person is to be

64
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,000
preferred law enforcement or

65
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,079
a legal background and knowledge of

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,920
federal and state regulations

67
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,519
good communication skills and ability to

68
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,598
pay attention to detail

69
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,719
to spot any potential errors good

70
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,919
organization skills for that

71
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,318
documentation

72
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,280
and the involvement and implementation

73
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,280
of certain

74
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,439
policies so the connection to the

75
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,719
cannabis industry as i said

76
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,520
the security directors in legal jobs are

77
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,598
necessary

78
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,280
when running a cannabis business the

79
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,919
safety and protection of the entire

80
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,239
operation

81
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,159
is the most important factor uh here we

82
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,280
see the vault area here might be

83
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,719
a bank but similar concept here we want

84
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,719
to still schedule one drug they can get

85
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,318
a valuable target for possible theft

86
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,840
without a legal team there is no way of

87
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,759
ensuring the business is safe

88
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,039
and having that security personnel and

89
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,359
those procedures

90
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,799
in place will minimize the potential

91
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,760
risk of having

92
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
any sort of theft occur so this is why

93
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,479
this

94
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,080
security is so important in many

95
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,439
industries but in particularly

96
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
the cannabis industry
