00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,560
i'm going to provide you with some

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,849
insight into

4
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:15,039
selecting a soil test lab

5
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:16,240
[Music]

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,759
so if you're looking to get your soil

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,358
tested that's a good thing if you're

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,800
looking at different soil labs

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
here i'm going to provide you with some

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,400
information about some of the options

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,000
available to you

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,239
so first off when we're talking about

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
soil testing the labs in general

14
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,759
i want to there's two common extraction

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,359
solutions that are used and this is

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
something you should find out

17
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,200
what the lab is utilizing one is a

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,919
modified morgan extract and that's a

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
weak acid

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
another one's called the malec 3 extract

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,280
that's a strong acid

22
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,878
so if you're comparing labs and they're

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,480
using different extraction fluids

24
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,960
you may be getting slightly different

25
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,799
results just as a word of caution

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,239
these are both universal extraction

27
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,078
procedures meaning they're used to

28
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,679
determine all major nutrients

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,840
and many of the micronutrients

30
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,119
simultaneously here we can see the

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,039
maelic 3

32
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,959
phosphorous and parchment versus the

33
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,879
morgan p in parts per million again we

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,960
see a little correlation there

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,799
comparing those two a lot of times with

36
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,039
phosphorus the lab will state which

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,640
extraction fluid it's using

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
now what are some options well there's

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,040
university labs and state universities

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,560
provide a reliable soil testing service

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,118
through their cooperative extension

42
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
service often both soil testing

43
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,239
and fertilizer and amendment

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,759
recommendations for the

45
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,000
intended crop are provided with

46
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,040
university labs these can be subject to

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,438
funding cuts or

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
labor shortages which can result in

49
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,559
longer durations

50
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
to get the results back to you so just a

51
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,359
word of caution there

52
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,759
i might want to check with the lab ahead

53
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,759
of time to see what their anticipated

54
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,040
time upon receiving the soil is

55
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,759
to the time they're generating the

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,479
report then there's also commercial

57
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,399
labs as comparison these tend to favor

58
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,519
large-scale growers and are volume

59
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,599
driven business

60
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,438
compared to university-based labs the

61
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,959
cost per sample is often greater

62
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,118
but this doesn't mean the results are

63
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,839
necessarily quote better

64
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,118
however the results are often in the

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,759
growers hands quicker

66
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,239
so when time is money commercial labs

67
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
can be the preferred option

68
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,360
now when we're deciding as far as what

69
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,959
lab to utilize well growers would

70
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
typically utilize the same lab

71
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,199
for many years it is a good this is good

72
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,120
practice as this is a way growers can

73
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,639
become familiar with the units

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
and will have the same extraction

75
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,799
procedure performed to help allow for

76
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,519
easy comparisons between fields

77
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,200
and also year to year of the same field

78
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,680
you should be taking soil reports

79
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,039
or soil tests over multiple years using

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,840
the same labs will allow

81
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,639
an even comparison now no matter what

82
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,120
lab that you

83
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,559
choose realize that springtime is

84
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,599
typically the busiest

85
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,439
season so

86
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,119
this is when you are most likely to have

87
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,639
results delays

88
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,120
it's meaning when you send your results

89
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,279
in don't expect them back next week

90
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
also the lab is only as good as the

91
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,560
sample you send them

92
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,080
so it doesn't matter necessarily what

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,640
lab you choose if you

94
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,760
are not well versed in sending a proper

95
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,919
field representative

96
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,598
soil sample to the lab the results they

97
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,079
give you can only be as good

98
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,119
as the sample you send them so keep in

99
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,599
mind and make sure

100
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,439
you're taking the proper procedures to

101
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,238
send whatever lab you choose a quality

102
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,318
result

103
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,039
so you will get quality results in

104
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,039
return
