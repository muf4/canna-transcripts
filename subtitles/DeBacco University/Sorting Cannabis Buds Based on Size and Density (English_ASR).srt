1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
so if you're choosing to sort your

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,318
cannabis buds based on their size and

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,520
in density this debaco university video

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,279
is for you because we're going to go

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,199
into some of the details

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:17,920
with this process and give you some

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,919
hopeful helpful advice

00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,720
[Music]

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,400
all right let's get into sorting chemist

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,598
buds based on size and

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,598
density so first off bud density

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,839
blood densities is essential because the

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,119
more dense basically the more yield here

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,600
we see a very dense

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,119
uh flattened flower here we see one is a

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,960
lot less density

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,119
more density simply means more target

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,558
plant material is produced and also the

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,479
denser buds has improved

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,320
visual appeal increasing the price

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,159
consumers are willing to pay

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,439
so even if these quote weighed the same

23
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,599
this would be one that would

24
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,599
drive a higher dollar value which should

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,399
be the goal of any grower

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,558
now we're maximizing density so genetics

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,120
do play a role so make a wise selection

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,718
at the very early part of the process

29
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,399
when growing keep the environment under

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,400
continual control and

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,080
document the conditions daily if you

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,040
want to have good records of your

33
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,039
growing area

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,320
provide the plants but specifically with

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,000
good light intensity

36
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,158
and the proper spectrum if you're

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,759
growing indoors growing outdoors

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,960
limited with the sun make sure that

39
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,920
you're trying to prune them and make

40
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,879
sure you're getting as much light

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,879
exposure to the bud regions as possible

42
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,000
this applies in both indoor and outdoor

43
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,640
and you want to have good

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,159
trimming and pruning style pruning style

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,280
the actual plant trimming of the actual

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,520
final buds

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,799
and do not harvest too early wait until

48
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,679
you get definitely that level of

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,280
maturity

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,280
with your buds so you're able to get the

51
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,640
maximum cannabinoids and terpenes

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,519
and have a good visual on end product

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,200
so we're starting buds by their size

54
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,879
this can be automated which is advised

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
for larger scale operations

56
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,399
there's two main commercial options um

57
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,478
here both kind of

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
serve the same purpose the goal is to

59
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,478
take a collection of plant material

60
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,319
collection of plant material and sort

61
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,280
them into different containers or

62
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,199
categories

63
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,799
this one kind of does it with different

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
hole sizes and kind of

65
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,159
kind of move them around and just

66
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,679
section them out here we're looking

67
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,598
they're all kind of passed down this

68
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,318
area here and as it gets progressively

69
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,479
wider

70
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,159
the smaller buds will fall through here

71
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,280
and be sorted here and the larger buds

72
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,680
will make it further

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,520
down and be sorted down here so this

74
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,040
automation is a great way to speed up

75
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,239
this process

76
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,159
now what's the importance of sorting

77
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
when we go through this kind of process

78
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,520
well

79
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,559
bud size can directly correlate to price

80
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,959
on the extreme case

81
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,120
the popcorn or kind of the small buds

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
are classified as seconds or kind of b

83
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,200
grade with indoor production buds will

84
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,239
be more consistent on the plant from the

85
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,759
top to the bottom

86
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,519
with the top buds still being the

87
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,799
highest concentrations of cannabinoids

88
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,159
and terpenes

89
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,239
going to be very similar to those in the

90
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,239
lower end but definitely higher

91
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,439
with that greater light exposure and

92
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,719
there's other studies here on this

93
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,000
channel that will kind of go into some

94
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,519
more detail on that

95
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,199
for outdoor growing there tends to be

96
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,039
more variability among buds

97
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,799
based on the location on the plant

98
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,079
location within the field how it might

99
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,680
be shaded

100
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,680
other branches might be blocking it so

101
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,439
again keep that in mind but this is

102
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,200
able to take whether it has consistent

103
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,318
or inconsistent original starting

104
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,560
product maybe

105
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,679
it does allow it to be sorted so you

106
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,800
have a lot of

107
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,480
consistency in your packaging then it

108
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
leads us to the last point here would be

109
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,919
second cut flower in the sense that

110
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
often these are smaller sized buds

111
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,759
but if from an indoor grower the potency

112
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,840
will be very similar to the larger

113
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,359
typically more expensive buds this can

114
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,959
be advantaged for someone who wants to

115
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,640
try a new variety

116
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,959
but it's important to kind of sort that

117
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,158
kind of popcorn to the a grade

118
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,479
simply because it's what a lot of

119
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,239
consumers are looking for particularly

120
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,280
purchasing dry flour they want those

121
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,000
eight grade

122
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,759
second b grades you can still get some

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
value in those for sure

124
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,000
sometimes they are sent to make

125
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,519
pre-rolls or extraction in extreme cases

126
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,438
but you definitely want to select out

127
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
your a grade because ideally

128
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,199
the a grade quality is going to get you

129
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,200
an a grade price
