1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,539
okay here we're looking at the animal

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,759
phylum nigerians

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,980
remember here for a little how to

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,940
pronounce it my own kind of rendition of

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,259
how to pronounce it

6
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:15,088
but you should be familiar with these

7
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:17,189
jellyfish so Cnidaria their tissues that

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,629
lead to greater specialization remember

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,550
our sponges we're now going a little bit

10
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:23,219
more advanced still pretty primitive and

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,490
simple but we are having tissues now

12
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:29,219
being formed now these animals here are

13
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,259
radial symmetry symmetrical remember our

14
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:32,640
sponges were not they have a body plan

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,460
that allows them to interact with their

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,299
environment on all sides so it's a high

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,670
environmental interactions that are

18
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,468
occurring and it's because of their body

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,239
type allows for that and the radial

20
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,300
symmetry remembers one of our key

21
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:52,078
distinguishing factors for being able to

22
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,609
place the complexity of animals so

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,679
there's different classes remember

24
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,109
phylum is the broader way of

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,600
categorizing things classes are a little

26
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,989
bit more specific box jellyfish sea of

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,269
enemies true jellyfish fire corals are

28
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,819
all under the same phylum but you can

29
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,048
see here there's four different classes

30
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,969
ever wonder how a jellyfish kind of

31
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,189
reproducers me kind of see them floating

32
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,868
around in the ocean around the beach the

33
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,629
life cycle of jellyfish includes two

34
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,670
stages we have the Medusa stage and then

35
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,039
we have the polyp stage here the polyp

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,930
actually reproduces asexually by budding

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,729
and the Medusa here we can see

38
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,009
reproduces sexually with this permanent

39
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:31,200
egg gonna kind of see that life cycle it

40
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,629
goes around and budding here the polyp

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,700
and we have our kind of individual

42
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:37,920
coming from there originating from there

43
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,560
it's a pretty simple organized a pretty

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,359
simple life cycle overall but more

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,379
complex and our sponges because we have

46
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:48,420
the development of tissues in addition

47
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,938
to tissues this allows for greater

48
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,590
specialization so a major evolutionary

49
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:55,859
advantage is something called

50
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,540
extracellular and digestion of food that

51
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,509
audition begins outside the cells are in

52
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,939
the gut or gastrovascular cavity this is

53
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,530
a big advancement this form of the

54
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,929
addition allows animals to digest an

55
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,419
animal larger than itself so this

56
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,700
extracellular digestion allows it to

57
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:16,579
take in portions of food part

58
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:18,619
and break them down this gastrovascular

59
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,219
cavity we see here locate on the inner

60
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,689
portion see here shown this is a

61
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:26,359
photograph of what it looks like and

62
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:28,729
then here is the illustration of

63
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,620
morphology so we see here's kind of

64
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:32,060
looking this camera angle will be kind

65
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,860
of from the top here looking down into

66
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,039
it we could see evidence of this

67
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,560
gastrovascular cavity this extracellular

68
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:45,859
digestion which is a key advancement in

69
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:47,569
our animal classification cnidocytes are

70
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,130
stinging cells so jellyfish might

71
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:50,208
highlight that one in particular is

72
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:52,729
that's probably one you're most familiar

73
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,400
with and because you're probably told

74
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:58,099
and earlier to stay away from them

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,250
animals this phylum stinging cells so

76
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:05,750
these stinging cells are what gives them

77
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:07,639
the ability to collect food now from our

78
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,650
standpoint more bigger than than they

79
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:12,109
are but we get that stephenson nation

80
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,549
it's just not pleasant in depending what

81
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,250
type of jellyfish it could be deadly

82
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:19,609
even to us these meta sites containing

83
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,409
large organelles called NASA cysts that

84
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:23,930
are stored in the coiled thread in

85
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,150
barbed you see that ended in here when

86
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,140
when hairlike projections on the cell

87
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,870
surface are touched

88
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:32,629
so here the thread of barbed of the

89
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,890
toxins are fired from the organelle so

90
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,819
we kind of see here the be attracted

91
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,949
stage you can have any of everything

92
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,229
kind of being condensed in and had like

93
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:41,389
a spring compressed down and when that

94
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:43,369
liver is tripped then you get the

95
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:46,729
popping there of the barbed and the

96
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,890
thread and that's where the toxins may

97
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:52,250
be kept that's what's causing this teeny

98
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:54,619
nature that's specific to jellyfish what

99
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,109
a great video to kind of look at this is

100
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,329
a great link here it shows this in

101
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:00,950
slow-motion so jellyfish have harpoon

102
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:04,189
like barbed this is a microscopic view

103
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:06,979
here called out the mast assist which be

104
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:09,650
our prey it retract towards the tentacle

105
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:11,179
these can discharge so explosively and

106
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,159
they show that in the video that's

107
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,780
capable of piercing the hardshell of a

108
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,650
crab so this is not something to be

109
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,689
taken lightly

110
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,298
there's definitely quite the punch

111
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:22,879
behind it there it actually filmed it in

112
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:24,620
slow motion on this video so that

113
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,560
smartereveryday video great one to check

114
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,418
out and it gets you to a pretty

115
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,620
she ate even though you may not enjoy

116
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:32,899
the experience if you ever been stung by

117
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,579
a jellyfish but what's going on with

118
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:36,579
that animal inside the tentacles
