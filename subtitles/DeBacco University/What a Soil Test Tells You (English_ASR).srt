1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,869
okay so here we look at what a soil test

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,969
tells you so you get to be adults back

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,620
it's a bunch of numbers what's the point

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:10,439
of taking it if you listen really

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,000
closely though well some people may have

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,649
to listen and think it's only whispering

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,960
to you others can look at a soil test

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,789
and hear on megaphone so keep in mind

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,528
that so that's gonna be a lot of good

10
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,769
information and then go through some of

11
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,028
that here so first off we're looking at

12
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:25,679
what's it screamed for well this is

13
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:26,309
looking at a general soil test you

14
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,929
looking at

15
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,209
typical nutrients calcium magnesium

16
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:32,609
phosphorus potassium else is immune to

17
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,600
iron manganese copper zinc aluminum

18
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:40,170
boron and so pH is also a great item to

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,230
get and can screen screen for typically

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,570
total lead which is more addressing the

21
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,308
potential for soil contaminants also

22
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,289
some for some I'll appropriate from

23
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:51,750
mineral soils so we're looking at me in

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,840
the field based soils here there's some

25
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,750
very common standard nutrient tests that

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,940
most labs will test for the report tells

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,500
you is an estimation of plant available

28
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,988
nutrients and this is an important

29
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,700
concept it is not the total amount of

30
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,679
the element in the soil

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,710
it's estimating the plant available

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,330
nutrients they did is the Nucci numbers

33
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,640
provide an idea what the roots have

34
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:17,188
access to and this comes back to this

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,400
chart here we can see how pH can vastly

36
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:23,579
impact the availability of nutrients now

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,618
so Tess attempts to estimate within a

38
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,840
close degree of tolerance of what that

39
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,239
plant can pull out of the soil so just

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,060
for example looking at potassium and we

41
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,089
get a very acidic pH pH below 5 we can

42
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,228
see the availability is much reduced

43
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,960
again it could mean that there's a lot

44
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:42,150
of potassium in the soil but it's not

45
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,548
very plant available so it will test low

46
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,820
on your nutrient analysis for your soil

47
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,860
report on other tests screen for example

48
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,389
organic matter this can be added to a

49
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,709
lot of standard nutrient tests and

50
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,290
determine what's called by a loss

51
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,899
ignition test this means this sample is

52
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,329
tried in the lab will weigh it they'll

53
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,680
literally burn it in an every way the

54
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,658
concept here is that the organic matter

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,450
is burned off leading only mineral ash

56
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,610
left the amount that's lost is the

57
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,679
organic content and that's expressed as

58
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,810
a percentage so just gives a little

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,740
background on how organic matter is

60
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,080
typically

61
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,480
the procedure is typically done for that

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,730
number you see in the soil test most

63
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,049
growers will want high organic matter it

64
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:24,209
really depends on what your need is or

65
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,640
starting level is in men in their soil

66
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,129
six to nine percent is a typical range

67
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,509
but I've seen twenty percent or greater

68
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,490
this tends to leave the excessive

69
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,919
nutrients increased disease pressure

70
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,080
high water holding capacity on this can

71
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,329
cause an issue so more is not always

72
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,580
better for I get it better if you're at

73
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,710
the six to nine range and modified that

74
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,170
that's probably plenty good right there

75
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,150
if I haven't even seen lower organic

76
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:51,389
matter percentages performing at a high

77
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,550
level overall in the country the soil

78
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:55,589
organic matter the higher ranges are the

79
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,700
darker colors it's the overall soils

80
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,069
tend to be a little bit higher organic

81
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,530
matter in this region and a little bit

82
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,180
lower organic matter in the southwest

83
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,590
region so just kind of gives you that

84
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,500
kind of perspective but just in general

85
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,939
in the country where higher native or

86
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,509
natural soil organic matter is present

87
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:18,569
what this shows is a percent change of

88
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:20,250
percent acres of organic matter so a

89
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:22,650
30-year percent change in soil organic

90
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,900
carbon in particular so carbon is kind

91
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,510
of one key measures of organic matters

92
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,520
so 30-year change compared to soil

93
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,109
organic carbon one year typically what

94
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,090
we see in the reds is where we're seeing

95
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,430
a loss then the greens is we're seeing a

96
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,950
game in that everywhere has data

97
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,890
cropland reported you can see there are

98
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:42,929
hairs that are depleting organic matter

99
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:45,839
at what can be consumed times considered

100
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,819
a alarming rate especially we're looking

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,009
at depending more and more on smaller

102
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:53,909
land parcels for agricultural produce

103
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:55,019
crops something else a soil report may

104
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,490
give you or may have the option to

105
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,500
include is something called soluble

106
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,909
salts this fat is typically only in

107
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,710
comes back oh they did have salts have

108
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:04,109
been added to the area and salts can be

109
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,060
include chemical fertilizer compost or

110
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,920
even areas where snowmelt may be applied

111
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,569
in winter months it's a good idea to

112
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,819
test at the beginning with proper

113
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:13,859
management future testing this test may

114
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,209
not be necessary you mean you don't

115
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,770
always have you to include this with

116
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,900
every test but when you're starting with

117
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,379
an area it's a good one to include on

118
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,399
the testing list thank you James a

119
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,560
little bit of a weird one

120
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,689
these values are only as good as your

121
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,060
sample meaning it's a volatile

122
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,379
nutrient it's constantly changing in

123
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,030
order to get results that are filled

124
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,740
representives certain steps should be

125
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:37,049
taken during the sampling process to

126
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,150
ensure accuracy which is analysis by the

127
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,590
lab typically this is performed in the

128
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:42,810
month of June especially for corn

129
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:45,060
growers it's called a June nitrate test

130
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,560
because this tangent is always changing

131
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,030
if you test early in the season when

132
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,600
soils are cold they'll get an

133
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:53,639
artificially low value so this psmt or

134
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,250
precise beta nitrate test to come in

135
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,250
tune I want to take a full one foot core

136
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,959
and here's corn for example and going

137
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,490
right through and sampling here and here

138
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,589
right along the row and kind of a zigzag

139
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,620
form and taking those six to nine

140
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:09,299
samples or so they want to be attentive

141
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,300
when taking soil samples and this is

142
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,620
true for any type of sample we can kind

143
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,150
of see in this image here this is a

144
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,310
large corn field and kind of shows what

145
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,839
I'm trying to point try to get across we

146
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,819
could see the coloration in the

147
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,589
foreground here nice and green and the

148
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,779
coloration here by the homestead also

149
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,819
green but if you look at it in this area

150
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:29,309
in the middle this see it's a little bit

151
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,019
lighter yellow here so this might be an

152
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,579
area you want a sample differently or

153
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,560
separately this could be caused

154
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,839
potentially visible of nutrients could

155
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,360
because it could be a water or a

156
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,899
drainage issue here could be so profile

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,669
issue could be it all all the above so

158
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,199
we want to sample this indifferently so

159
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:48,779
we can see if the problem is in the

160
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,180
nutrients of this particular section of

161
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,799
this field lastly there's something

162
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,689
called particle size this is an

163
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,669
expensive test is often not caustic

164
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,168
justifiable for most growing conditions

165
00:05:56,668 --> 00:06:00,418
it's basically the assessment of the

166
00:05:58,168 --> 00:06:01,620
particle size of your soil this test is

167
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:03,750
a greater importance for golf courses

168
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,970

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,319
maintain those nice eating conditions so

170
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,930
for most growers I can't really

171
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,849
recommend the edit cost we really can't

172
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,168
modify for that just to give you some

173
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,419
background that it is possible to get

174
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:17,569
the particle size evaluation of your

00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,569
soil
