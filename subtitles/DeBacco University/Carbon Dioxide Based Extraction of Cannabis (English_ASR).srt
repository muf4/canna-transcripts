1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
if you've heard about carbon dioxide

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,278
based extraction of cannabis

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,960
you've come to the right place here on

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,638
debacle university because we're going

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,080
to go through and explain a little bit

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,079
more about this extraction

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,600
process

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:21,118
[Music]

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
all right let's get into carbon dioxide

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,599
based extraction of cannabis

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,359
so first off what's the description of

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,679
this method well the plant materials

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,480
first ground and then place into an

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,199
extraction

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,880
vesicle co2 gas undergoes intense

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
pressure and heat until it becomes

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,679
supercritical and a pump then forces the

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,799
supercritical carbon dioxide into the

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,238
extraction chamber

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,119
where trichrome and cannabinoid

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,959
breakdown occur so this is involving not

22
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,119
just regular co2 in the air

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
there is that getting it into that super

24
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,238
critical level

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,840
this is why specialized equipment is

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,679
required

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
now this goes on to this shows another

28
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,799
image down here

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,799
the pressure release valve forces

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,078
material into a separate container

31
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,239
where the temperature and pressure can

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,319
be precisely controlled this will cause

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,600
the molecules within the initial

34
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,438
mixture to bond to the co2

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,118
many systems will reroute the co2 back

36
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,758
into the tank causing

37
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,799
uh it to be used during the next batch

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,200
so they can kind of like almost

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,560
go back and kind of like reuse that the

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,439
extraction that was then moved to a

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,600
collection dar

42
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,039
such as a beaker we have separate

43
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,719
collection jars here and collect

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,320
separate fractions here we're seeing

45
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,400
that co2 is going back to recycler where

46
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,879
it could be potentially reused

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
so this is important to know that it's

48
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,399
not just

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,840
as simple as co2 from the air we are

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,079
having that supercritical

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,320
level of co2 and this says what is part

52
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,000
requires the specialized equipment

53
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,919
so what's the resulting end product well

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,959
the co2 extraction results in a crude

55
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,719
oil extract

56
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,319
that must be further refined through

57
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,118
other muscles such as

58
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,118
the distillation process the potency of

59
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,438
the extract typically ranges from 50 to

60
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,359
70 percent cannabinoids

61
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,758
the advantages of this method is higher

62
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,640
yielding than alcohol-based extraction

63
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,478
less value material is wasted specific

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
compounds with adjustments made to heat

65
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,080
pressure and run time

66
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
so we can kind of determine what we kind

67
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,599
of get or extract from this

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
no residual solvent in the final product

69
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,238
due to the evaporation of the carbon

70
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,080
dioxide

71
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,520
that's a great way kind of quote unquote

72
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,120
to dispose of

73
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,360
the waste there however the

74
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,878
disadvantages are that

75
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,879
much higher initial startup costs when

76
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,159
compared to other extraction methods

77
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,519
once purchased the equipment does

78
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,439
require proper training and safety

79
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,560
procedures to be understood and followed

80
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,280
mainly because you are creating that

81
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,280
supercritical carbon dioxide

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,039
so again there are some advantages

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,680
disadvantages of each but typically this

84
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,318
process

85
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,080
will require additional steps after but

86
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,280
this can be a great way to kind of start

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,440
the refinement process

88
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,878
start the extraction process and may be

89
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,840
worthwhile exploring

90
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,840
for your operation
