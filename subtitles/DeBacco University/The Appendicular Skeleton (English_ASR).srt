1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
this is going to be a very brief

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,250
introduction to the appendicular

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,799
skeleton because I'm breaking apart into

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,080
all individual pieces this one's only

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,740
going to focus on this shoulder girdle

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,660
here so the bones of the pectoral girdle

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,230
or the shoulder grill here are called

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,800
the scapula just the shoulder blade

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,380
that's okay

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,800
here and the clavicle you took you may

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:28,049
know as the collarbone these bones allow

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,060
the upper limb to have exceptionally

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,899
free movement so that's how they

14
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,850
participate in the skeletal system now a

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,590
and B we should be familiar with our

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,800
views of the body and be able to

17
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,840
identify those so our scapula right

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,699
prosti review and i'm not going to make

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,770
you memorize all the different parts for

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,270
at least in my class but the bones of

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,670
the scapula it should be able to orient

22
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,590
or highlight where this would be located

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,770
if we're looking at the right prosti

24
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:00,059
rear view of the scapula in contrast to

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,680
that this is the right anterior view so

26
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:03,718
remember Oscar is going to be in the

27
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,319
back that's looking at it kind of in

28
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,460
this way and then the anterior view is

29
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,309
can be looking at this way and see it's

30
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,769
much smoother on this region so it's

31
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,829
that quick overview of the scapula and

32
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:21,349
the clavicle the initial start to the

33
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,349
lesson on the appendicular skeleton
