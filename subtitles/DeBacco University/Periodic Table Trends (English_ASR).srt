1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,928
okay so here we're gonna go over some of

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,099
the periodic table trends hopefully

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:07,378
you're familiar with the journal

4
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,509
Organization the periodic table and this

5
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:12,960
will allow you to develop a greater

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,968
understanding of exactly why it's

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,679
organized the way that it is and what

8
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:20,039
inferences we can make about certain

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:22,079
elements so starting with ionic trends

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,720
elements on the Left which are metals

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,518
tend to lose they also electrons to form

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,339
positive ions when more valence

13
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:31,640
electrons are the outermost electrons so

14
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,289
in this image here the gray circle

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,909
represents the neutral form of the atom

16
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:40,950
and the red represents the iron form so

17
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:43,439
when we're losing those valence

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,239
electrons the radius is getting smaller

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,849
but notice with the atom becomes smaller

20
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,409
in contrast here elements on the right

21
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,280
side the nonmetals tend to gain

22
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:55,769
electrons to become negative ions you

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,530
see here's our neutral atom in the gray

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,710
and when we're adding that negative

25
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:05,549
electron we could see that the Irenaeus

26
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,500
is actually becoming larger in this case

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,350
because here we're losing that outer

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,150
shell those outer electrons coming

29
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,069
smaller here we're kind of gaining more

30
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,189
and that's because causing our radius to

31
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:19,758
be some larger those ions so cations

32
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:23,039
positive ions and from smaller radius

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,219
anions are negative ions gonna form a

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,259
larger radius so we're talking about

35
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,618
ions here we're looking at binding and

36
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,930
occur and it's occurring or bonding keep

37
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,180
in mind two of the same types or two

38
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,729
negatives or two positives will repel

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,640
each other and a positive and a negative

40
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:43,259
will attract one another so that you see

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,509
that here positive and a positive are

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,310
repulsive and a positive and negative

43
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,959
are attractive that's gonna be important

44
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,868
to get to molecules and healthiness bind

45
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,209
together so our periodic trends

46
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:56,819
properties elements tend to occur in a

47
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:59,429
periodic way known as a trend and as you

48
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,408
move across a period or down a group so

49
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,840
we're going to be looking at knowing

50
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,729
element trends allows us to make

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,399
predictions about an elements behavior

52
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:09,810
we're gonna see that here so starting

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,090
first with atomic radius it's the

54
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,800
measure of the size of an atom four

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,569
elements that occur as molecules the

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,670
atomic radius is half the difference

57
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,889
between nuclei of identical atoms that

58
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,329
you see right here the average distance

59
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,458
from the center of the nucleus to the

60
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,150
edge of the adjacent electron cloud is

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,229
determined to be the radius so what does

62
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,989
this look like what's our trends look

63
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:32,729
like well Tomic radius increases as you

64
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:37,230
move down a group so it's just a group

65
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:38,789
one here as we move down our group or

66
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:40,079
our family we see the radius is

67
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:42,959
increasing well why does this occur

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,019
actually occurs to a lesser extent to

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,030
all of them here we notice this increase

70
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,640
that we see in our radius is because of

71
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,400
the increased number of electron energy

72
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:57,598
levels the more energy levels the larger

73
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:01,680
the radius so our if we compare our row

74
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:04,109
to here or a period two as you go down

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,030
to period four you notice these are

76
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,800
radius all gets larger putting that in

77
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,959
different kind of way to visually see

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,209
that see these are trying to give you a

79
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,560
3d effect at the height of columns and

80
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,569
we could see here these columns are

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,759
smaller indicating the radius is smaller

82
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:23,488
and these are taller and getting a

83
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,128
larger radius so we have an increasing

84
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:29,030
going from right to left and increasing

85
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:31,289
and radius going from top to bottom

86
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,479
now what tends to first students here is

87
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:35,429
the atomic radius generally decreases as

88
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,738
you move from left to right so if we

89
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,090
look at period four for example all the

90
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,640
way on the left here we see a large

91
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,860
radius we continue down that period you

92
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,048
get to here we see a smaller radius

93
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,730
occurring down this end this is due to

94
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,980
the increase in negative charges

95
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:52,619
providing a greater pull by the positive

96
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,628
nucleus reducing the radius so what does

97
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,340
this mean well here we have one electron

98
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:57,090
on the outside one negative charge way

99
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,830
on the outside

100
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,170
that's so longer it needs to be quite

101
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,830
large that positive charge can't really

102
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:06,359
of the nucleus can't let pull much in

103
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,560
here we have a lot of electrons on the

104
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,799
outside putting a greater negative

105
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,509
charge giving those positive protons in

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,930
the nucleus something greater to pull on

107
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:18,779
pulling them closer reducing the overall

108
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,939
atomic radius

109
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,589
ionization energy that is basically the

110
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,449
minimum amount of energy required to

111
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:28,409
remove a valence electron forming a

112
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:31,270
cation canines are positive ions

113
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:34,380
ionization energy increases up a family

114
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:37,149
and from left to right down a period a

115
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:39,009
helium peachie requires the greatest

116
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:40,989
amount of energy to remove a valence

117
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:43,960
electron we see that here a great amount

118
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,288
of energy see all our noble gases helium

119
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:50,168
neon argon require a lot more energy to

120
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:52,689
remove that electron than say our alkali

121
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:54,849
metals in general lithium our sodium our

122
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:58,389
potassium okay we're looking at trends

123
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,860
here look to an affinity I'll try to

124
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,990
finish the amount of energy released

125
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,439
when an electron is added to a neutral

126
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:08,288
atom or molecule to form an anion and

127
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:11,019
ions are negative ions it occurs when we

128
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:12,699
add an electron this follows a similar

129
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:15,788
trend ionization energy across the

130
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:17,889
periodic table so again we learn one you

131
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:21,728
can see electron affinity has some of

132
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:23,110
the same properties to that metallic

133
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:25,120
character refers to the level of

134
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,979
reactivity of the metal it increases as

135
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,079
you go down a family the most reactive

136
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:31,389
metals are found in the lower left

137
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,189
portion of the periodic table so if you

138
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,658
have a periodic table take a look at it

139
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:36,689
you want to find cesium which is going

140
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:38,978
to be in that lower left-hand portion

141
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:40,658
that's not found in nature as a free

142
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:42,639
element since it reacts explosively with

143
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:45,158
water and will ignite spontaneously in

144
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,038
air francium that fires the same lights

145
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:51,038
below the cesium and the alkali metal

146
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:52,288
group but is also very rare that most of

147
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,639
its properties have never been observed

148
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:58,779
so these are very reactive these have a

149
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,610
lot of that metallic character a non

150
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:02,500
metallic character relates to the

151
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,449
tendency to accept electrons during

152
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,908
chemical reactions kind of the opposite

153
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:08,288
what we just discussed nonmetals tend to

154
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,569
gain electrons and chemical reactions

155
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:12,879
and have a high attraction for electrons

156
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:15,519
within a compound the most reactive

157
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,348
nonmetals reside in the upper right-hand

158
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,538
portion the periodic table fluorine

159
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:22,209
being the most reactive since noble

160
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:24,069
gases are basically unreactive so we're

161
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:26,709
looking at trends noble gases are

162
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:28,689
unreactive when I look at fluorine being

163
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:31,149
the most reactive

164
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,800
with the non-metallic character the

165
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:35,049
small sample of pale yellow liquid

166
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,050
fluorine is considered is condensed at

167
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,780
liquid nitrogen you can see that here

168
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,129
varies if you be very cold that's

169
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,919
because you just the major fluorine

170
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,509
containing mineral fluorite so again

171
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,640
fluorine and fluoride too might sound

172
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:51,370
familiar very distinctly and very

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,289
different properties lastly here

174
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,480
metallic and nonmetallic characters more

175
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,670
of a general trend there's no clear

176
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,009
distinct division between metallic and

177
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,870
nonmetallic character as you move across

178
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,730
the periodic table there's an increasing

179
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,160
tendency to accept electrons which is a

180
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,840
nonmetallic property and decrease the

181
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,720
possibility of an atom that would give

182
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,489
up one or more electrons put the picture

183
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,770
here going from black to white you see

184
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,629
this large gray area to show you there's

185
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:19,539
not a clear division it's kind of this

186
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:21,339
general trend that occurs so again just

187
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,920
to go back to the first slide here of

188
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:26,379
our general trends we see how electron

189
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,590
affinity changes ionization energy

190
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:31,959
atomic radius again will increase it

191
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,969
would go top to bottom and right to left

192
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:36,729
the left-hand affinity follows

193
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,140
ionization energy and that metallic and

194
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,240
nonmetallic character it's kind of that

195
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:43,060
kind of gray area that black to white

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,439
kind of transition that does occur so we

197
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,560
have to review this just a little bit

198
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:49,269
focus especially on atomic radius while

199
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,030
learning some of the key terms here this

200
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,620
will help us develop trends to better

201
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,689
understand elements of the periodic

202
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,590
table that we met may not be able to

203
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:58,589
specifically study
