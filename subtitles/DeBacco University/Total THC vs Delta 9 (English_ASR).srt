1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
in this tobacco university video we're

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:07,278
going to look at the

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:09,839
difference between total thc and delta

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,400
9 thc and there's a lot of confusion

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,798
about

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,599
what's total what's delta nine hopefully

7
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,480
here we'll get

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,039
to some clarification between these and

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
how

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
delta 9 is calculated which is very

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,760
important for legal aspects

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,880
so understanding thc potency reporting

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,840
and a lot of this has to do with the

14
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,799
reporting

15
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,599
so first understand that the thc

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,199
molecule is

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,159
naturally produced in plants in its

18
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,399
inactive form known as

19
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:39,599
thca only a small fraction of the

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,640
active delta 9 thc typically written is

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,879
here delta 9

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,359
form is generated in the plant however

23
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,599
heating the inactive thca

24
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,558
results in its conversion to the active

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,120
delta 9

26
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:56,479
thc however only a maximum of 87.7

27
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,280
of the inactive thca can be converted to

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,078
the active

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,920
delta nine th sa so here we have the

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,000
thca the inactive form

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,198
and here we have the delta 9 thc the

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
psychoactive form

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,478
of thc so they are structurally

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
different

35
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,280
usually it takes heating to be able to

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,359
get to the delta 9 form of thc

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,599
so once it comes to reporting was this

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,359
kind of why is this important

39
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,679
well in addition to reporting thc a

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,359
values labs must now calculate the

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,560
amount of delta 9 that

42
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:29,118
can form from thc a and that can

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
form is through the resulting of heating

44
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:31,599
this is where calculations come into

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,519
play

46
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,280
so why is this important well thca is

47
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,239
converted to delta 9 upon heating

48
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,879
however thca loses 12.3 percent of its

49
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,839
weight

50
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,438
when converted to delta 9 thc how does

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
this factor into the calculations and

52
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,639
reporting

53
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,599
well first you need to determine the thc

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,439
values

55
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,640
and independently determine the values

56
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,478
for thc

57
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,599
a and delta 9 thc then you want to

58
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,239
subtract 12.3 percent from the thc a

59
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,478
value

60
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,399
this is due the difference in thca and

61
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,799
delta 9 thc molecules

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,920
and then 3 you add the delta 9 thc and

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,039
the new thc

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,038
a values together to get the total

65
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,359
thc value so that's that difference

66
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,039
between the total and the delta nine

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,760
thc values and i get these sources here

68
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,199
are listed

69
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,280
in the description if you want to check

70
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,359
them out for yourself here i'm providing

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,759
kind of a nice little description here

72
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
to walk you through the process now

73
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,719
let's go through an example here of this

74
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
reporting

75
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,479
uh and again gonna put some numbers here

76
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,759
so feel free to pause the video or

77
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,959
look down in the description as well you

78
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,399
can find some of the slides and go

79
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,840
through this yourself

80
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
the data shown here at the top right

81
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,519
indicates the thca content

82
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,360
of 24.34 in the thc

83
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,319
or the delta 9 thc content of 0.74 in

84
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,120
this particular

85
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,238
example sample provided to determine the

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
maximum delta

87
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,519
9 thc that can form from this thc a

88
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,040
value

89
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,439
the thc value must be multiplied by

90
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:03,039
0.887

91
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:07,199
so here's our 24.34 thca

92
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,318
times that .877 we get 21.34 which is

93
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,000
the maximum

94
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:14,158
delta 9 thc that can form from there

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,199
to get the final total thc remember

96
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,560
talking about the difference between

97
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,919
delta 9 and total

98
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,039
thc value this is the maximum delta

99
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:26,000
9 thc derived from the thcs and

100
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,798
is added to the value of delta 9 thc

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,759
that was present

102
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,480
in the sample so again going back here

103
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,759
this would be the 21.34 percent that we

104
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,079
calculated here

105
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,878
as the maximum delta 9 thc that can be

106
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,680
derived from

107
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,399
the original thc a value and then we

108
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
want to add

109
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,760
that 0.74 delta 9

110
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,920
thc which naturally occurs in the plant

111
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,719
to get a total thc value

112
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,280
of 22.08 percent we would see that

113
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,438
listed

114
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,759
right here so it gives you kind of an

115
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,759
example here of reporting in total thc

116
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,399
calculations here

117
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,878
now the delta nine thc testing for hemp

118
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560
under

119
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:07,518
connecticut's public act 19-3 which is

120
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,199
established in august 27 2019

121
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,879
in this example the lab may dry the

122
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,238
sample prior to extraction

123
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:17,039
both to convert thc a to delta 9 thc

124
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,639
and provide a driving basis for analysis

125
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,160
the analysis must be done using

126
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,759
either of the following methods could

127
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,960
use gas

128
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,240
chromatography the gc and or it could

129
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,560
use high performance liquid

130
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,319
chromatography hplc

131
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,560
and with gc this also converts the thca

132
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,399
to thc during analysis

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,680
in our analysis procedure is one test

134
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,839
and will result in the

135
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,478
total delta 9 thc compared to

136
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,519
hplcs and they calculate delta 9 and thc

137
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,560
separately from

138
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,120
thta using the formula listed below

139
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,478
within

140
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,519
their document now looking at the labs

141
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,680
processing

142
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,198
wet samples labs processing wet samples

143
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,879
will need to calculate a dry weight

144
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,478
separately and apply that to

145
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,800
measurements to test

146
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,240
results to convert to dry weight basis

147
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,520
so remember it's always factored on the

148
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,079
dry weight basis so if you get a wet

149
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,000
sample

150
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,599
to take that into consideration lab

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
processing wet samples must use a

152
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,639
technique

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,120
capable of measuring both thca and delta

154
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,680
9

155
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,840
thc and use the formula present on the

156
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,879
next slide to convert those thc a values

157
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,478
to delta 9

158
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,959
thc while other metabolites of thc exist

159
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,159
the they only include thca in the

160
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,279
calculations

161
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,400
so for example delta 8 thc is not part

162
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,719
of the calculations

163
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,399
only delta 9. so it's important to make

164
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,000
that distinction

165
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,439
the formula to use is mentioned

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,600
previously

167
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:43,759
total theoretical tetrocabidiol or thc

168
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,080
content is the maximum of possible delta

169
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,720
nine thc in a hemp crop

170
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,478
if total conversion were to occur and

171
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,759
would be determined by the following

172
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,599
calculation

173
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,120
so the sum of the concentration of the

174
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
delta nine thc

175
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,319
in its precursor thca multiplied by

176
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,479
again at 0.877

177
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,319
on a dry weight basis and reported to

178
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,439
two significant figures and here's the

179
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,720
calculation

180
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:11,519
that total theoretical thc equals

181
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
the concentration of delta 9 thc plus

182
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,000
the concentration

183
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,360
of thc a times

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,319
that .877 and add those two together get

185
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,879
your total

186
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,560
theoretical thc value so there's a lot

187
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,319
of math here and conversions

188
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,079
kind of walk your way through it look at

189
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,600
the example i provide and that will help

190
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,560
you hopefully give you that

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
idea of how that delta nine tt compares

192
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,560
to the total

193
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,680
thc values here now the method of

194
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
testing

195
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,879
now labs must indicate the method of

196
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
testing used on their certificate of

197
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,918
analysis or coa

198
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,079
the same must also include a statement

199
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,159
whether or not the sample has delta 8.

200
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,159
i'm sorry delta 9 thc concentration

201
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,160
greater than that

202
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,360
0.3 on a dry weight basis

203
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,520
and this will determine whether they

204
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,439
pass or fail as being hemp

205
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,038
or fail being above this level would

206
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,160
then be classified federally as

207
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,079
marijuana

208
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,599
the resulting reporting limit is defined

209
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,839
as at 0.3 delta

210
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,680
9 thc this includes measurements of

211
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,119
uncertainty determined by the laboratory

212
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,439
as an example if the measurement of

213
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
uncertainty is 30 the reporting limit

214
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,240
will be 0.39

215
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,038
thc and all samples below 0.39 will be

216
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,319
reported as

217
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:22,478
less than 0.3 which is very important

218
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,240
from the federal standpoint set by the

219
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,240
2018 farm bill

220
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,079
the results below the reporting limit

221
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,800
report is that 0.3 percent

222
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,879
will pass and above that will be

223
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,918
quarantined reported as a status of

224
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,199
failure so from a hemp grower standpoint

225
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,079
to make sure that the crop they are

226
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,319
growing is

227
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,758
hemp is important to have this test done

228
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,360
to make sure that there's that

229
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,680
certificate of analysis that stamp of

230
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,240
approval that is truly hemp that you're

231
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,199
growing

232
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,918
and it passes this test here looking at

233
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,879
the

234
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,240
thc levels within that particular plant

235
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,680
so hopefully this was helpful always

236
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,000
welcome to go back and review look at

237
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,720
the

238
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,160
description for sources and again thank

239
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,080
you for tuning in to this

240
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,080
other dubaco university video
