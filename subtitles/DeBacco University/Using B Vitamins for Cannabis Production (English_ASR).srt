1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,160
so if you're considering using b

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,559
vitamins for your cannabis plants

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,278
suggest you watch this debacu university

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:17,919
video

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:17,920
to see if it's a right option for you

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,118
all right let's get into using b

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,880
vitamins for cannabis production

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,239
well first off i have a reference

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,079
article here if you're wondering where i

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,399
got some of the information from

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,839
links provided here first page is here

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,399
so you're welcome to investigate it

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,678
further

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,000
this is just going to be a brief

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,079
overview so starting off with just b

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,119
vitamins often associated with improved

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,799
root formation

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,359
however this has not been proven to be

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,000
the case as in the original studies

20
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,759
the b vitamins were mixed with auxins it

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
was actually the auxins that were

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,599
actually responsible for the increase

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,280
in root growth so it kind of was

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,480
associated that osb vitamins in there

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,000
improved root growth

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,159
but really if you look at these original

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,439
studies they're looking at the fact that

28
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,038
auxins were added and really the

29
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,000
oxidants were doing the actual root

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,198
formation

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,558
not necessarily the b vitamins so adding

32
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,840
b vitamins the additional

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,920
of b vitamins is not advised simply

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,118
because plants in the field can produce

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,000
their own thymine

36
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:16,000
in addition so it can soak in many fungi

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,079
and bacteria that live in the root zone

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,438
so even though the plants may need it or

39
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,039
benefit from it

40
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,719
in their root zone there's a lot of

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,520
microbes that can produce it for the

42
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,200
plants

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,280
to reduce transplant shock and root

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,280
formation create a supportive

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,359
environment for the plants by adding an

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,400
oxen product that may be incorporated

47
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,078
and is suggested over adding b vitamins

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,159
because that's really where the

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,000
improvements were occurred in those

50
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
original studies

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,159
so where to add b vitamins you know are

52
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,078
they applicable anywhere

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,359
well if you're involved with the kind of

54
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,519
tissue culture process

55
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,759
of cannabis then the use of b vitamins

56
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,759
particularly can play an important role

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,439
but this is a limited case that most

58
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,599
growers do not participate in

59
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,718
because of the general difficulty that

60
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,959
canvas presents

61
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,158
with the tissue culture propagation

62
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,399
process in general

63
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,079
so other than that b vitamins would be

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,318
utilized in this to some degree

65
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,840
if you're growing actual plants from

66
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,919
seeds or clones

67
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,239
really that advice that b vitamins focus

68
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,000
more on a protective and supportive

69
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
growing environment and if you want to

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,318
encourage root formation

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,760
probably seek auxins over the addition

72
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,759
of b vitamins
