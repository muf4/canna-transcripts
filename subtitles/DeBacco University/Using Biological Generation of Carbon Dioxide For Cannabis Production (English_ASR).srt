1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
here on tobacco university we're going

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,410
to look at biological

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:14,639
methods of generation for carbon dioxide

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:15,679
[Music]

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,679
all right let's get into using

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,118
biological generation of carbon dioxide

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,118
for cannabis production

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,399
as we can see here the basic process is

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,559
taking glucose

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,679
breaking that down which is a sugar

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,118
monosaccharide

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,358
and breaking it down into what

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,278
ultimately is going to be carbon dioxide

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,640
here that would can be used in

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,880
many of the food and beverage industry

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,759
so in general yeast will generate carbon

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,679
dioxide

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,839
so simply mixing yeast with a sugar

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,159
source will produce carbon dioxide

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,000
this is an easy and low-cost solution

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,759
that can likely be made with materials

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,759
found around many households

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,119
we can see many different methods of

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,039
that we're taking a

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,119
bottle we're taking a tube having that

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,198
carbon dioxide being siphoned out

27
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,280
and put directly into the grow space it

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,920
was really relatively simple

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,120
minimal materials now there are

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,519
commercial sources

31
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,840
so there are these commercial sources of

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,159
biological generation of carbon dioxide

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,320
that offer extended production they use

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,719
some special mycelium-based strains

35
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,319
to allow for efficient production of

36
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,478
carbon dioxide

37
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,478
also the process is very easy to use

38
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,920
companies claim a six-month life to

39
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,560
their products

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,680
and we see just a couple shown here now

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,200
just keep in mind because it is a

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,520
biological system

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,118
there will be certain kind of uh degree

44
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,920
of optimum as far as temperature goes

45
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,159
and humidity

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,478
and food sources so just keep in mind

47
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,840
that it's a will produce carbon dioxide

48
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,359
but biological systems do have their

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,280
limitations now the downfall of using

50
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,118
these biological systems no matter what

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,719
name brand or source you're looking at

52
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,359
biological generation is inherently

53
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,959
variable

54
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,759
so your plants will not receive a

55
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,000
consistent dose of carbon dioxide

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,920
also there is no monitoring system to

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
regulate the carbon dioxide levels

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
meaning some points they could be very

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,159
high levels others could be very low

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,640
levels

61
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
these systems also work day and night

62
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,439
and carbon accident is only usable by

63
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,759
the plants

64
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,919
during the daylight hours so you have

65
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,159
times of production of carbon dioxide

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,679
that it can't really be utilized by the

67
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,479
plants you're trying to grow

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,400
so it helps that reduces the efficiency

69
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,919
of the overall system

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,480
now there's also with anything you

71
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,559
should be doing a cost benefit analysis

72
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,479
so while adding any carbon dioxide above

73
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,640
ambient around 400 parts per million

74
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,399
can be beneficial to the plants with

75
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,159
biological based products the actual

76
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
addition cannot be measured

77
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,840
controlled or repeated these are

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,879
different things to keep in mind well it

79
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
may help you grow

80
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,000
one cycle it's going to be difficult to

81
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,238
try to repeat

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
those exact conditions so while these

83
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,959
systems can offer some benefits the

84
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
consistency

85
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,400
of a dedicated carbon dioxide enrichment

86
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,120
system will provide

87
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,959
long-term increase in yield assuming all

88
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,039
other factors are not limiting

89
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,959
also using a true compressed bottle

90
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,639
system or liquid system

91
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
can also allow for very consistent

92
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,518
results as well as

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,158
monitoring of your environmental

94
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,158
conditions all which play into

95
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,158
maximizing plant production
