1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,629
so here I'm gonna go over reading a

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,700
graduated cylinder accurately and while

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,439
this may seem kind of obvious keep in

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,388
mind there can be different scales used

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,210
depending on the size of the graduated

6
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,980
cylinder so every line and every

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,990
graduated solar does not necessarily

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,940
mean the same thing in some cases it

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,629
could be 0.2 it's gonna be 1 it could be

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,429
10 mils so just be mindful of the scale

11
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:25,460
of the particular graduated cylinder

12
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,599
you're reading at that moment in time

13
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,859
you want to look closely so when you're

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,390
looking at the cylinder the liquid does

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,750
not create a flat line but it forms

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,640
actually a u-shape and for water it'll

17
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,289
look like this mercurial it looks like

18
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,020
this which odds are your project could

19
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,119
be measuring mercury this curve is

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,789
called the meniscus might be familiar

21
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,530
with that for anatomy physiology

22
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:48,870
meniscus is in the knee area knee joint

23
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,480
depending on the diameter and and the

24
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:54,780
material used of the cylinder this will

25
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:58,799
impact the degree of that meniscus being

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:02,129
used and depending on how wide it may be

27
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,408
you might see it to a lesser extent or a

28
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,819
greater extent also the liquid in the

29
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,990
interaction that liquid has with the

30
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,438
walls of the container can also

31
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,849
influence it the key part is the where

32
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,368
you position your eyes when you're

33
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:17,069
reading that meniscus so you want to

34
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:18,989
read the liquid on a level surface with

35
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,298
yourself parallel to the height of the

36
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:24,569
liquid you want your eyes to be at the

37
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,720
same parallel line as the bottom of that

38
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:29,368
meniscus and while this exaggerated will

39
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,489
look like this you want to always always

40
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:34,159
read from the bottom if we go back to

41
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,599
the previous slide for just one moment

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,060
it's the bottom that's facing this way

43
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,379
it'd be the top if it's facing down in

44
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,840
this way so it's kind of that tangent

45
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,719
point there the other reason why you

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,899
want to have your eyes level there is if

47
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,000
you read the correct it that's how you

48
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,950
get the level if you're standing too

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,680
tall and we're looking down that's gonna

50
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,939
create a artificially low reading and if

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,170
the Graduate Center is higher than you

52
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,239
and you're looking up that's gonna give

53
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,100
an artificially high reading both

54
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,739
sources for error in your measuring

55
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,359
technique now practice reading graduated

56
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:09,239
cylinder so there's a couple examples

57
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,978
here so I would suggest each one start

58
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,870
with what is the reading you pause the

59
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,610
video and you look at and see what

60
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,140
get and then compare it to the correct

61
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:21,450
answer so here we're looking at 18.0

62
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,329
milliliters so this would be 15 it

63
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:26,429
should be 20 15 16 17 18 it's right on

64
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,120
the line each of these is worth a 1

65
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:35,069
milliliter look at this one and what do

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,469
you get for a reading looking here you

67
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,628
got it correct you're looking at 36 and

68
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:41,158
a half milliliters that meniscus is

69
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:47,340
directly in the middle of those two

70
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:49,229
lines there let's do another example hey

71
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,450
looking here we're looking at 42 point

72
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:53,310
and I'm we're not quite on that line

73
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:58,018
we're just below it so that's why we get

74
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:03,689
the 0.9 and in this example what's the

75
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:05,370
reading here we're looking at 61 point 2

76
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:08,310
this is where someone else looked at

77
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,689
this make it sixty one point one but

78
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:17,459
again this is where I'll have a little

79
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:18,719
source of error and swim here so isn't

80
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,430
because it's right on the line is forty

81
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,500
seven point zero it's important to put

82
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,510
that point zero there because you are

83
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,489
having that degree of uncertainty you

84
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:28,828
just don't want to write 47 you want to

85
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:32,549
write forty seven point zero because

86
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:34,019
that shows the degree of accuracy of the

87
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,430
instrument that you're using so

88
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,409
hopefully this gives you a little

89
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,659
insight and a little brush-up on how to

90
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:41,400
read graduated cylinder properly so that

91
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,939
this does not become a source of error

92
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,939
in your lab
