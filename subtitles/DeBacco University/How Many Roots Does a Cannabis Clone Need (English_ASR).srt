00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,160
here in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,439
i'll go over how many roots does the

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,679
cannabis colon need

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,800
well it's not enough what's too many uh

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,359
we're going to assess

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,810
some actual roots and give you an idea

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:21,969
of what the ideal rooting is

8
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:21,969
[Music]

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,278
all right let's go over how to evaluate

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,759
your cannabis clinton's

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,518
roots so first off when is a clone

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,599
adequately rooted what is that kind of

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,839
ideal amount that's a common question

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
and it really has a variable answer you

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,399
want to consider

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
what substrate or lack of substrate

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,000
where your plant can be growing in

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,679
where is the plant going to be going

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,159
ultimately and how old

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,159
is the plant with the variability images

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,199
will be provided as a comparison for

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,199
evaluation

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,120
mainly looking at clones that were

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
rooted in aeroponic cloner because we

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,399
can actually see the roots in the

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,000
structure of them

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,000
in general the goal of a quality clone

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,079
is to have a well-developed root system

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
roots are starting to branch and the

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,160
length of the roots will actually

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,239
support

32
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,840
the growing plant you can see here with

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,600
these initial roots developing

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,079
it's a good sign but not nearly

35
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,599
adequately rooted enough

36
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,920
so this is kind of the image of what i

37
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,519
would consider to be the ideal rooting

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
because there's even rooting on all

39
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,000
sides the roots are just starting to

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,680
branch

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,599
when i say branch we're looking at these

42
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
small little development of these kind

43
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,158
of root hair like appendages

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,599
there's a nice even white coloration to

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,320
the roots and this makes for easy

46
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,478
transfer

47
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,399
into whatever selected substrate the

48
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,280
grower will be going into with the

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,640
with the clone when we're starting to

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,478
root so what does this kind of look like

51
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,000
here we kind of flip these over

52
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,679
and while these could be transferred at

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,118
this stage it is possible

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,159
typically we recommend you wait for

55
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:48,078
another few days it would be recommended

56
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,840
why because while there's roots starting

57
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,199
you want them just to kind of develop a

58
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,960
little bit further so they can be able

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,560
to support the plant growth

60
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,000
as i said an aeroponic cloner is an

61
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,719
ideal environment so the roots will

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,759
likely develop

63
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,640
faster to ease the plant transition

64
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,560
process

65
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
so they can actually produce more roots

66
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
and faster with an aeroponic system

67
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,280
before you transfer them and that's why

68
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,959
wait just a little bit longer

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,318
now this rooting here looks like it

70
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,878
would be you know ideal this would be

71
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,958
like what

72
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,639
every grower would want their roots to

73
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,039
have but this is actually a little bit

74
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,759
past

75
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,919
prime there's many roots this column is

76
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,519
a little bit class prime but only about

77
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,878
about a day or so

78
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,640
this does not mean it will transfer

79
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,000
poorly but the multiple route here is

80
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,679
forming and multiple root branches

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
forming at the main site for nutrient

82
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,319
absorption

83
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,920
so upon transfer there likely will be

84
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,799
some damage there's just so many roots

85
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,759
here no matter what

86
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,959
media you're going to put in what

87
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,799
substrate you're going to put it in

88
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
you're most likely to do some damage to

89
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,439
that root structure

90
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,040
the plant though will likely be to

91
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,120
recover well but be aware that those

92
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,318
finer roots is where the majority of the

93
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
absorption of water

94
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,518
and absorption of nutrients occurs in

95
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,119
the plant

96
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
more branching is better than a thicker

97
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,680
root structure you want a thick carrot

98
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,799
root you want that branching

99
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,400
but you want to be damaging that

100
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
branching so that's going to be damaging

101
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,000
the uptake

102
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
of water and nutrients for your plant

103
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,239
and we also have here where we just have

104
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,280
simply

105
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,878
uh too many routes here this is

106
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
just kind of letting it sit in the

107
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:09,199
cloner a little bit too long missing it

108
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,878
by

109
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,878
sometimes only a short duration of time

110
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,639
they can grow fast once they start

111
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,000
growers still they should be still

112
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,759
transferred to the next stage but

113
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,878
realize they're a little past prime

114
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,959
and that will kind of hinder that

115
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,079
transition process

116
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
in the end the plants will likely

117
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,680
perform well but this may be a little

118
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
bit slower to make that transition

119
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,200
since they are a little past primal too

120
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
much rooting is occurring here

121
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,039
the clone can go quickly from no root to

122
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,919
too many so daily inspections is

123
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,519
recommended

124
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,679
to catch that ideal day to make the

125
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,360
transfer and this is why so many growers

126
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,280
like the aeroponic cloner

127
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,840
which allows them to pull plants at the

128
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,479
ideal time to ensure the minimum amount

129
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,000
of

130
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,679
transfer shock or transplant shock

131
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,479
that's occurring and maximizing their

132
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
production
