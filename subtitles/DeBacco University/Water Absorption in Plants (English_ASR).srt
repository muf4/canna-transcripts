1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,569
so here we're gonna be looking at water

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,370
absorption in plants and now when we

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,199
water plants we just assume they absorb

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,120
the water we may think it's kind of like

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,620
a sponge here absorbing the water it's a

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:11,820
little bit more complicated than that so

7
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:15,029
I just want to go over a couple key

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,329
aspects how plants absorb water so the

9
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:20,399
first one here the main site of water

10
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,500
absorption is the fine root here so it's

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,909
a key component there the fine root here

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,039
is because this is where there's a lot

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,980
of surface area to volume a lot of

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,109
contact on these not only the roots but

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,869
the fine root hairs is where the major

16
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,820
site of water absorption occurs now once

17
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,729
it gets through these very fine hairlike

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,159
structures it can enter either an apple

19
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,589
plastic or symplastic group what that

20
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,109
means is the apple plastic group is

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,390
through the cell wall we can see that

22
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:49,920
here and we see that down here there's

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,230
also the symplastic root which is

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,820
through this cytoplasm ultimately

25
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,488
regardless of the way that the water

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,009
initially enters it's all going to be

27
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:01,589
kind of funneled to and translated to

28
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:04,408
these vascular bundles we see kind of a

29
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,670
microscopic view so these vascular

30
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,409
bundles are ultimately going to

31
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,510
transport the water to the rest of the

32
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,640
plant in this getting these vascular

33
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,799
bundles in a little bit more detail we

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,400
see there's two main types there's what

35
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,689
we call the xylem and what we call flow

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,659
now the xylem is transporting mainly

37
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:24,089
water and some ions up the plan so xylem

38
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,310
goes from the roots upward to the shoots

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,180
so from the roots to like the stems or

40
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,269
the leaves in that kind of one direction

41
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,680
phloem though most carbohydrates the

42
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:37,109
byproduct of photosynthesis of sugars

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,380
and it moves us corrodes up and down the

44
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,969
plant from source cells to sink cells so

45
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,459
what that means is source cells are like

46
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,170
the leaves that are first making those

47
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,059
sugar molecules and you're being

48
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,649
transported to sink cells those sink

49
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,590
cells could be actually developing roots

50
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,299
it could be the flower buds it could be

51
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,490
a growing part of the plant that needs a

52
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,920
lot of energy and that's what the phloem

53
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,890
is doing up and down from the site of

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,689
production to wherever it needs to be

55
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,250
transport it to look at this now I don't

56
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:10,469
have to go look in great detail but the

57
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,789
vascular bundles D is the xylem and

58
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,719
they're a little bit larger they're

59
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,719
almost good to them almost like

60
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,280
in E is the phloem fibers so we could

61
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,840
see the e because there's moving up and

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,449
down there's transporting source to sink

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,039
we see a lot of smaller cells here

64
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,409
because they're involved a lot more than

65
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:27,699
active transport the xylem just moving

66
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:28,960
kind of that bulk water I can think of

67
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,729
it like pipes moving through the plant

68
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,520
and that's moving the bulk of the water

69
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:35,530
from the roots to the shoots hopefully

70
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,990
that helps kind of a illustrate a little

71
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,650
bit the examples here water absorption

72
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,650
plants
