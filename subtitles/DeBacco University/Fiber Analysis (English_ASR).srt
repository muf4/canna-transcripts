00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
welcome back to another video here on

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
debaco

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,720
university today we're going to be

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,040
looking at fiber

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,919
analysis and as we see in the rope

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,439
picture here

7
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,000
this is a large piece of fiber but

8
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,518
there's also some smaller fibers in here

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,278
so we're going to look how you would

10
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,480
analyze those and how would we

11
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,920
look at those in more detail so

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,679
first off when we're looking at fibers

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,560
there's two main categories there's

14
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,759
natural fibers

15
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,599
which are made from animal or

16
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,359
plant-based fibers and you might be

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,278
familiar with like cotton silk and wool

18
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,520
we see the cotton plant located right

19
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,960
here then we have synthetic fibers which

20
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,120
are man-made or artificial

21
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,480
they're produced entirely from chemicals

22
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,199
typically in extrusion

23
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,759
process examples of these are polyester

24
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,719
rayon

25
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,759
or acrylic polyester is the single most

26
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,239
used textile

27
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,359
overtaking cotton so we've actually

28
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,280
started using more

29
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,558
synthetic fibers than natural fibers now

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
we're looking at fibers want to be

31
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,079
taking into consideration the coloration

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,679
of those fibers

33
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,520
so here's an example of kind of viewing

34
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,198
them on a large scale and then we're

35
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,040
also under a microscope

36
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,399
and this is an acetate fiber we see that

37
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,320
kind of blue color

38
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,080
if it didn't have any dye in it it can

39
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,959
be like a gray kind of

40
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,879
color to it if the dye wasn't present so

41
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,759
this definitely shows that with a light

42
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,399
microscope

43
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,599
you can also determine individual fiber

44
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,680
color

45
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,719
then we get into fiber diameter so we're

46
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,640
looking at these particularly the

47
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,478
diameter of the fiber

48
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,680
just like a circle the diameter is kind

49
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,159
of through the center

50
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,439
and from one end to the other it's a

51
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,400
straight line that passes through the

52
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,118
center

53
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,439
and ends at the endpoints of that circle

54
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,159
so

55
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,359
same as diameter in a math class since

56
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,159
here can be variable because only

57
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,799
provide a general

58
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,560
range keep in mind as a person ages

59
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,680
their hair

60
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,600
typically becomes thicker and stronger

61
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,280
and the thicker hair is found closer to

62
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,959
the root section of the hair

63
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,879
and kind of like thins out or almost

64
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,959
tapers as it gets to the end

65
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,000
within some degree and the diameter of

66
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,000
human hair

67
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,078
is typically a range of about 17 to 181

68
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,040
millionths of a meter or typically we

69
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,519
start looking at

70
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,719
microns and here's an average here here

71
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,000
of 70

72
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:15,039
microns in diameter lastly we have

73
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,719
a fabric pill which is the pilling is a

74
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,639
term used for loose strands

75
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,400
or balls of fiber that form on a piece

76
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,679
of fabric typically if you have older

77
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
fabric you kind of get this

78
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,680
pilling that develops and pills form due

79
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
to rubbing and abrasion during normal

80
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
wear and use and this can indicate if

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,719
you find a piece of

82
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,959
fabric that does have a lot of this

83
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,280
pilling indication that it might be

84
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,840
worn or has a lot of abrasion over a

85
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
period of time
