1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,679
here i want to attempt to simplify some

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,719
of the complexities

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,000
associated with gel electrophoresis and

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,759
explain them to you

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,519
this is the basic equipment and setup

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,480
and this is a typical end result that

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,359
you'll see

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,880
but how do we go from here to here well

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,278
stay tuned

10
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,079
well we have dna fragments migrate

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,960
through a gel

12
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,278
so we are going through a gel and this

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,199
gel is going to allow portions or pieces

14
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,599
of dna to be able to move

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,359
through it now the gel electrophoresis

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,079
is a procedure that separates out these

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,520
molecules

18
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,439
based on the rate of movement through

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,480
the gel and is influenced by an

20
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,839
electrical field

21
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,519
keep in mind that dna does have a

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,520
negative charge to its backbone

23
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
allowing this positive negative charge

24
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,600
to be able to move the fragments

25
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,879
gel electrophoresis is a widely used

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,320
technique

27
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,159
for analysis of nucleic acids as well as

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,359
proteins let me give you just a general

29
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,919
breakdown that these

30
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,679
bp stands for base pairs so a thousand

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719
base pairs versus only 100

32
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,079
the smaller the base pairs the smaller

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,000
the molecular size

34
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,079
the greater the distance that they it

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,438
can move or travel

36
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,719
and that's going to be a consistency

37
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,798
with the gel electrophoresis process

38
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,760
so this gel electrophoresis will require

39
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,720
an agarose

40
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,400
gel well agarose gel with electro

41
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,759
freezes between the use in preparation

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
for dna analysis

43
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,719
if you look at it under a skinning

44
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,199
electron microscope kind of looks like

45
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,719
this

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,719
think of it as like a net or a bunch of

47
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,640
little pores through here

48
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,719
it's a polymerase agarose it's porous

49
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,719
allowing for the movement of dna

50
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,158
this is why the larger fragments kind of

51
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,239
get caught up in this net

52
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,920
the smaller fragments are able to move

53
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,839
through it much easier

54
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,118
now it's a linear primal extracted from

55
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,240
seaweed specifically

56
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:43,680
and while you may think it's got a

57
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,640
seaweed color it actually ends up being

58
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
this white

59
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,040
kind of thin a small and fine powder

60
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,560
dna is negatively charged as i mentioned

61
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,240
so when placed in the electrical field

62
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
dna will migrate towards the positive

63
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,839
pole

64
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,759
or the called the anode and agarose gel

65
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
is used to slow the movement of dna and

66
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,959
is separated by its size

67
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,719
with the smaller fragments moving

68
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,478
further than the larger one so here

69
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,000
we're looking at how fast will the dna

70
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:08,719
migrate well depends on the size of the

71
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
dna

72
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,719
small dna will move faster than large

73
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,640
dna and electrophase it separates dna

74
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,479
corona size so here are the wells

75
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,759
this is where we initially place the dna

76
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,679
and we fill those up

77
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,799
with our dna which contains small and

78
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
large fragments

79
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,959
we turn the power on keep in mind the

80
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,239
positive of on the far end of the gel

81
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,520
and the negative over here

82
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,280
dna with its negative charge will get

83
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
pulled towards the positive end and

84
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
depending on size will separate

85
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,639
here we see an example of the small bits

86
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,479
of dna in smaller sections

87
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,919
smaller base pairs of dna traveling

88
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,719
further than the larger base pairs

89
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,559
within aggression linear dna migrates

90
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,080
inversely proportional to the log base

91
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,519
10 of their molecular weight

92
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,160
what does that simply mean smaller

93
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,000
fragments move further than larger ones

94
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,199
so if you want to make an agarose gel

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,759
they said the aggress is this white

96
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,518
powder

97
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,840
it's prepared by combining agarose

98
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,599
powder and a buffer solution

99
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,360
and it's going to have to be heated up

100
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,119
to the point of boiling so you also need

101
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,560
a flask for boiling

102
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,200
the electrophoresis equipment

103
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,519
specifically is going to

104
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,119
require a casting tray so you want to

105
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
seal the edges of the casting tray

106
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,759
put in the combs you see here that's

107
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,598
going to be placed in on a level surface

108
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,359
and none of the combs should be touching

109
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,560
the surface of the casting tray

110
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,840
what these combs are going to do is

111
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
create little wells that you're going to

112
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,799
put the

113
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,158
dna in now to give you just an idea

114
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
these are very small

115
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,639
so what makes this such an efficient

116
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,719
operation is it can occur on a tabletop

117
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,878
doesn't need a large area

118
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,799
to occur it's a power supply it's a gel

119
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,439
tank a casting tray

120
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,719
some power and some combs here now when

121
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,598
you mix the agarose

122
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,439
with the buffer we need to boil it so

123
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,639
when we're looking at our agarose and

124
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,878
our buffer solution we want to combine

125
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,119
the agarose powder in buffer solution

126
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,399
use the flask that is several times

127
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
larger than the volume of the buffer

128
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,599
because we'll be heating it

129
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,640
aggress is inside at room temperature so

130
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,919
when you first add it you're going to

131
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,199
get this kind of like immediate

132
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,958
separation

133
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,958
then the aggro solution is boiled until

134
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,878
it's clear you want to gently swirl the

135
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,719
solution periodically when heating

136
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,079
to allow all the grains of agarose to

137
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,680
dissolve well in it

138
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,439
be careful when boiling the aggro

139
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,640
solution may become superheated and may

140
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,199
boil violently

141
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,798
if been heated for too long for example

142
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,000
in a microwave oven

143
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,399
so you want to be very careful with that

144
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,759
boiling process keep it controlled

145
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,359
then once boiled you want to get some

146
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,160
mitts that actually have some insulation

147
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,120
to them because you're going to be

148
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
pouring this

149
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,840
very hot liquid i want the aggression to

150
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,759
cool slightly but not too much otherwise

151
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,279
it will solidify in the flask

152
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,879
when i say cool it's about 60 degrees

153
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,638
celsius and then carefully pour the

154
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,199
melted aggro solution into the casting

155
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,439
tray

156
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,478
to avoid air bubbles each of the gel

157
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,560
combs should be submerged

158
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,000
in the melted agarose solution as we see

159
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,839
here when cooled the

160
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
agarose polymerizes forming a flexible

161
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,359
gel should appear lighter in color

162
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,199
when completely cooled and this will

163
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,800
take about half an hour to 45

164
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,639
minutes to occur then you want to

165
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
carefully remove the tape on the sides

166
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
and the combs and you have a prepared

167
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,520
gel

168
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,199
then you're going to place the gel in

169
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,319
the electrophoresis chamber

170
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,160
now the advantage of this you can make

171
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,519
the gel the day before a couple days

172
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,360
before and hold on to it

173
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,478
before you're able to run it this is one

174
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,600
advantage that maybe you go through a

175
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,199
day of gel making

176
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,280
and you go through a day of kind of

177
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,240
running through the analysis portion

178
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,198
you want to add this to the chamber and

179
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
you might add enough

180
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,960
buffer to cover the gel to a depth of at

181
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,879
least one millimeter

182
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,079
make sure the well is filled with the

183
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,439
buffer solution

184
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,639
and keep in mind that dna is going to

185
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,839
migrate this way because here's our

186
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,360
positive anode

187
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,959
and here's our negative cathode and you

188
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,560
can see our buffer solution in

189
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,079
a series of wells sample preparation in

190
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
gel loading

191
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,079
you want a six time loading buffer it

192
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,038
can have this really dark kind of blue

193
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,959
color

194
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,478
you can use glycerol for weight that you

195
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,638
can use uh

196
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,519
bromophile blue for color and you can

197
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,120
mix those two

198
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,519
you want to mix the samples of dna with

199
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,360
the six eggs sample loading buffer

200
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,879
with tracking dye this allows the

201
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,800
samples to be seen when loading into the

202
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,399
gel makes it a lot easier

203
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
and increases the density of the samples

204
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,679
causing them to sink into the gel wells

205
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,038
the last thing you want to do is go

206
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,079
through and load those gel wells and

207
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,000
have everything kind of flow

208
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,758
and go into the buffer solution you want

209
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,439
to stay in that well region

210
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
so because you want to push it or pull

211
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,800
it through that

212
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,400
gel to allow that separation to occur

213
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
then with good pipetting skills you want

214
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,560
to carefully place the pipette over the

215
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
well

216
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
gently expel the sample the sample

217
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,759
should sink into the well be careful not

218
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,960
to puncture the gel with the pipette tip

219
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,520
so it requires a very

220
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,079
steady hand then we're actually running

221
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,279
the gel

222
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,560
i'm going to place the cover over the

223
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,478
electricity's chamber collect the

224
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,918
electrical leads connect the electrical

225
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,519
leads to the power supply

226
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,799
be sure the leads are attached correctly

227
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,680
with the positive and negatives being in

228
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,280
the right area

229
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,439
because dna will migrate towards the red

230
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,079
or the anode and the positive in this

231
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,839
case

232
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,918
when the powder when the power is turned

233
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,758
on bubbles should form in the electrodes

234
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,279
the electropieces chamber indicating

235
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,840
that you do have a flow of electrical

236
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,839
current

237
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,439
and just be mindful that that is

238
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,359
electrical hazards so

239
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,879
you want to be mindful when that power

240
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
is on

241
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,000
warning the gel when it's in progress

242
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:03,439
after the current is applied make sure

243
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,240
the gel is running in the correct

244
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,000
direction

245
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,000
double triple check this otherwise you

246
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
might lose your entire experiment

247
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,199
bromenthile blue will run in the same

248
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,639
direction as a dna and it gives you an

249
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,478
idea of here's the wells

250
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,079
you can see that it is moving towards

251
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,560
the anode it is moving through the gel

252
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,680
there

253
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,439
so this is hooked up correctly dna

254
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,639
ladder is also recommended to be added

255
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,719
an inclusion of a dna

256
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,079
ladder which is basically just sections

257
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,199
of known sizes

258
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,560
it's called the ladder because it kind

259
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,759
of looks like this nice little rungs of

260
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,000
a ladder

261
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,919
it makes it easy to determine the sizes

262
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,120
of unknown dna fragments

263
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,799
so this is a known defined inclusion

264
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,800
of different base pairs allows you to

265
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
compare that to your own sample

266
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,319
note blonde blue migrates to

267
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,000
approximately the rate at about 300 base

268
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,759
pairs of dna molecule

269
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,199
so if you see a little darker band in

270
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
that area it could simply be the

271
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,319
bromentile blue

272
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,000
when you're staining the gel gonna place

273
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,199
it down a staining tray containing warm

274
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
diluted stain

275
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,720
allow the gel to stain for about 20 to

276
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
30 minutes follow the protocol

277
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,800
suggested to remove excess stain allow

278
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,199
the gel to destain in water for a little

279
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,879
bit

280
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,960
replace the water several times for an

281
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,319
efficient d stain so you're getting

282
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,359
a well-defined band region you have many

283
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,400
options when you're looking at gel

284
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,960
staining

285
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,878
ethidium bromide is one that's probably

286
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,478
used quite extensively

287
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,280
because it does bind very efficiently to

288
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,079
the dna and it fluoresces under uv light

289
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,519
however be mindful and caution is that

290
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,639
glove should be worn at all times when

291
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,959
hailing this

292
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,240
because it is a powerful mutagen it will

293
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,240
bind to the dna in the gel

294
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,080
and also the dna in your hands and your

295
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,120
own body so it can be

296
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,278
toxic it can potentially be a carcinogen

297
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,278
so again be mindful when handling

298
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,519
burlington blue always always wear

299
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,360
gloves as a result there's some safer

300
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,320
alternatives like methyl blue or bio-rad

301
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,320
makes when rewards

302
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,920
make some uh the advantages that these

303
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,160
are inexpensive they're

304
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,039
a lot less toxic they don't require uv

305
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,838
light source

306
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,679
no hazardous waste disposal but they're

307
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,880
not used in some cases because they can

308
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,120
be less sensitive

309
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,439
more dna is needed on the gel and longer

310
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,120
staining and destaining times

311
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,279
so again the safer alternatives do have

312
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,360
some advantages but ethidium bromide

313
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,200
when used on those kind of trace samples

314
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,560
just be mindful as a handler of that

315
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,959
material

316
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,679
here's a gel with athenian bromide stain

317
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,079
we see it here

318
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,439
placed on a uv light trans luminor the

319
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,800
environment requires ultraviolet light

320
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,320
to be visualized so right now with the

321
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,039
uv light off you really can't see

322
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
anything

323
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,240
but this would be the surface it would

324
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,480
be prepared on

325
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,600
then we turn the uv light on you can see

326
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,039
here should be wearing protective

327
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,639
glasses if you are viewing it

328
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,639
you can start to see some banding

329
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,199
developed here and you can take a good

330
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,639
image

331
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,240
and then be able to use that for

332
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,519
comparisons

333
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,360
visualizing dna with that athenian

334
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,080
bromine is what a kind of picture would

335
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,080
look like

336
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,839
here are the wells here the ladders and

337
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,959
here's the pcr product it's plumless

338
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,080
chain product

339
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,079
samples 1 4 6 and 7 were positive

340
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,200
for 500 base pair dna fragments and we

341
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,200
could see that this

342
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,600
right here so again gives you this kind

343
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,320
of that idea of being able to separate

344
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,879
dna

345
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,120
determine if a certain fragment or base

346
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,278
pair length is present

347
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,480
here's the visualizing the dna with the

348
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:07,919
quick view stain

349
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,399
here we see the same wells you see in

350
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,439
the ladder we see the same pcr product

351
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,958
we see here 1 6 7 10 and 12 are positive

352
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,720
for 500 base pair of fragments

353
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,039
this is not a thin bromide in this case

354
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,600
there was sufficient amounts of dna the

355
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,199
sensitivity wasn't necessarily required

356
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,879
so we could use one of those safer

357
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,240
alternative staining products

358
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,159
and here you can see compared to the

359
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,799
gold standard of ethydium bromide

360
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,799
you'd see a very similar result
