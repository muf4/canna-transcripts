1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,910
okay here I'll get the gastrointestinal

2
00:00:02,448 --> 00:00:08,638
often abbreviated GI tract also known as

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,660
the digestive tract and when we're

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:14,968
talking about the GI tract or the gastro

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,820
intestinal tract looking at basically a

6
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,198
tube and that tube has a lot of layers

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,960
to it you'd see a lot of veins and

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,429
arteries and a lot of layers to it so

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,670
we're gonna look at some of what occurs

10
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:29,099
in this digestive tract so start with

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,920
the basic overview of the GI tract I

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,280
could see our necessary organs and

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,399
basically what each is contributing to

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,260
the process of digestion begins in the

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,320
mouth works its way down through the

16
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:45,750
entire GI tract ultimately exiting out

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,640
the anus at the very end now some very

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,229
important steps that do occur here

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,960
you're welcome to pause this video and

20
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:55,198
take a look at some of the summaries of

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,250
the particular points of the digestive

22
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,988
tract continuing on we have actions of

23
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,878
the GI tract so what's in general

24
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:04,978
occurring we just saw they are what's

25
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,899
occurring at very specific locations but

26
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,760
in general what's occurring well first

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,560
off we have the ingestion process this

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,450
is occurs when materials entering the

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,060
mouth here we see the horse eating the

30
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,310
grass this is the ingestion part you

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,840
have to have it first enter that GI

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,909
tract then there's a mechanical

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,680
processing this is the crushing tearing

34
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,509
we see here with the giraffe and is

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,610
basically making materials a little

36
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,340
smaller and easier to move throughout

37
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:31,349
the the GI tract then we move on to the

38
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,829
actual digestion process this is the

39
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:36,929
breakdown of food into small organic

40
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:39,089
components for absorption keep in mind I

41
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,680
Jessen is not the same of absorption

42
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,630
we're just having this initial kind of

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,439
breaking apart and this typically occurs

44
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:48,539
in the stomach and also the intestines

45
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:50,879
moving on we have a secretions which are

46
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,130
release of water acids buffers enzymes

47
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,170
themselves in the epithelium of the GI

48
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:57,298
tract in glandular organs what does that

49
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,519
mean well in order for this process of

50
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,979
digestion to occur enormous breakdown to

51
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,560
occur enzymes have to be release to be

52
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,390
secreted at certain points based on the

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,219
pH of different points of our GI tract

54
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,378
that will determine what enzymes are

55
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,020
released where then we have absorption

56
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,919
this is movement of organic substances

57
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,900
electrolytes

58
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,909
water across the digestive epithelium

59
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,680
because if the nutrients only stayed in

60
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,859
our digestive system and didn't get to

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,080
our actual blood system and into our

62
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,640
body that would be the point so we need

63
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,980
to have that very important absorption

64
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,329
phase and lastly remove a little waste

65
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,139
we have the execution phase and that's

66
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:37,020
where we're just removing bodily fluids

67
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:39,208
now as general summary of kind of our

68
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,489
digestive system it is a tube within a

69
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:44,039
tube you're basically one long tube with

70
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,989
openings at both ends let me say sorry

71
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,629
because that's basically all it is is

72
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,709
there's a distinctive path that it takes

73
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:51,329
you could see there's different things

74
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,319
that happen to it of course along that

75
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,850
path but simply it enters one point

76
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,159
mechanical and chemical processes occur

77
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:03,269
throughout and it exits out the other

78
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,939
end so your tube within a tube the

79
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,560
histology structure of the GI tract you

80
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,959
can see here a little bit more detail a

81
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,539
zoom in of the different layers involved

82
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,300
and how there's this intense network of

83
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:18,719
our RVs and our veins and our different

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,180
types of tissues allowing food to easily

85
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,669
pass through and also for not only the

86
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,269
digestive process to occur but also that

87
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:29,159
very important absorption process that

88
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,650
digestion its water absorption also as

89
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,569
we see the same image again here cells

90
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,719
cannot actively absorb or secrete water

91
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:40,379
all movement of water across the lining

92
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:43,590
of the digestive tech involves down or

93
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,750
up osmotic gradients remember as Moses

94
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,670
is simply that movement of water and

95
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,039
that is why the body is so important

96
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,419
regulating different ion concentrations

97
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:55,229
to determine whether water will move

98
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:57,869
into or away from certain areas and we

99
00:03:55,229 --> 00:04:00,389
can see here some of the secretions that

100
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,500
are occurring in the estimated volume of

101
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:05,988
that water with the digestive endocrine

102
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,250
system there's hormones

103
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,469
cholecystokinin play important roles in

104
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,299
the digestive process you can see all of

105
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:14,430
these many different hormones and

106
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,319
released at different points because

107
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,900
there's also different pH in different

108
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,750
breakdowns occurring at different parts

109
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,370
of the digestive system hormones will

110
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,189
play vital roles and several bodily

111
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,439
functions and processes as do certain

112
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:30,509
and

113
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,310
lastly we have the microbial communities

114
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:35,039
in physiological gradients along the

115
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,620
mammalian GI tract you could see here in

116
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,410
the stomach to tottenham jejunum ileum

117
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,100
and colon rectum what our microbe load

118
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,890
is this is in scientific notation some

119
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,950
of the actual bacteria that are living

120
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:52,919
in different regions and also the oxygen

121
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,599
concentration and pH so keep in mind out

122
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,400
of the stomach the pH is very low or a

123
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,879
minimum and as we work our way through

124
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,719
the pH will actually increase or raise

125
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,569
ultimately the neutral I'm actually

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,460
slightly basic I'll bile acids will

127
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,420
decrease as we work our way through so

128
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:08,069
on and so forth

129
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,870
so it just gives you that idea well

130
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,060
there's just one long tube there are

131
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,160
very certain specific and certain

132
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,370
processes occurring at different regions

133
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,230
to maximize the digestive and also the

134
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,230
absorption process for the building
