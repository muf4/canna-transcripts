1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
on this debaco university video if

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,200
you're looking at irrigating plants with

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,960
pond water

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,160
this video should be of interest to you

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,039
because we're going to go over some of

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,199
the specifics

7
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:17,920
you should be considering if you're

8
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,919
going to be using pond water

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,179
[Music]

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,760
so let's go over utilizing pond water

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,679
for outdoor cannabis production

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,118
well first off your goal should be with

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,599
really any water is to

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,439
test the base water what's the natural

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,960
water what are you starting with

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,960
no matter the source you need to have an

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,000
idea of what the base water source

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,239
has as a starting point basics such as

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,640
parts per million or ec and ph

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,078
and also the temperature should be

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
easily determined with a

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,039
quality water meter and this is just

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
important to know what you're starting

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,920
with

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,840
the specifics of the pond water also

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,960
include analysis for microbial life

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,120
within the water

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,558
that's more specific to your pond water

29
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,399
i don't know what type of algae might be

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,079
living in there what type of microbial

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,480
life become microbial pressure you might

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,640
have

33
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,239
with the water you're intending to use

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280
for irrigation

35
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,199
now pond water itself light

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,760
likely contains sediment as well as

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,280
microbes so that sediment is could be

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,118
just from runoff could be because of

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,079
heavy rainfall infiltrating into the

40
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,680
area

41
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,200
both of these items the sediment in the

42
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,040
microbes should be removed before

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,478
entering the irrigation system

44
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,159
this sediment should be removed because

45
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,039
it can clog vital components and the

46
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,040
microbes can grow

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,118
inside the irrigation lines or

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,400
potentially damage the crop itself

49
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,680
so these are important things to kind of

50
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,600
go through and remove and there's

51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,799
filters for each of these

52
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,158
growers should be implementing these

53
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,439
filters to remove these from the

54
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,040
irrigation water

55
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,398
so it's okay if they're in the original

56
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,079
water but they should not be in the

57
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,200
water that is actually reaching the

58
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,279
plants

59
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
now there are some filtration options

60
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
this is looking at some here for the

61
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,559
sediment

62
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,680
so sediment filters remove the visible

63
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,478
particulate matter

64
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,280
and many particles of dirt sand dust and

65
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,599
debris

66
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,118
and it can be caught by its micron rated

67
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,158
capacity and again the smaller the

68
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,560
microns the

69
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,000
smaller the filter the smaller particles

70
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,840
it will be removing

71
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,360
cinnamon filters also remove the

72
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
turbidity from the water so it can make

73
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,360
it have a cleaner appearance

74
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,799
however the limitations of sediment

75
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,520
filters are that they do not remove

76
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,239
chemicals

77
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,560
heavy metals bacteria or any dissolved

78
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,319
particulate matter so keep that in mind

79
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,318
they also do not improve the taste or

80
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,318
smell of the water they're only like a

81
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,199
physical screen as a way to think about

82
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,799
it

83
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,719
now there are different types of

84
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,719
sediment filters we could see here

85
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,159
there's a pleated filters located right

86
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,959
here and it's best suited for large

87
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,039
particulate

88
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,080
they're also washable and reusable it's

89
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,598
an advantage

90
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,879
then there's melt bloom filters and

91
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,919
they're best suited for finer

92
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,439
particulate

93
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,119
and there's string wound filters look at

94
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,199
right below me here

95
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,878
and once overloaded the sedan will pass

96
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,039
through them indicating

97
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,199
there's a need for a filter change but

98
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,878
this could cause issues down the line

99
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,318
so some growers will kind of run one

100
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,000
filter to remove some of the

101
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,158
larger particulate and another stage

102
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,080
filter doing some finer particulate

103
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,519
streamline filters great while they're

104
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
working but once they get full

105
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,200
sun will pass through them then we see

106
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,639
here there's bag filters

107
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,238
and they can change in micron size

108
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,679
between 1 and 200

109
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,840
and we have spun down filters are

110
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,599
designed to remove large size debris

111
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,280
from the water so you can see you don't

112
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,560
need to use all of these but a lot of

113
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,959
growers are choosing to use

114
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,759
multiple stages of filters to ensure

115
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,239
they're removing

116
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,919
all of the particulate now how

117
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,120
frequently should you change a filter

118
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,280
well this depends on kind of many

119
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,319
factors one reliable method is to watch

120
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,640
for a pressure drop

121
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,359
meaning a full filter this filter was

122
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,279
full

123
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,879
meaning clogged with sediment will cause

124
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,239
a reduced in water pressure

125
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,759
so the general recommendation is to

126
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,280
change the filter or at least check it

127
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,239
every six to twelve months

128
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,080
but installing pressure uh kind of

129
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,519
gauges before and after the filter you

130
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,640
can see if there's a mat there should be

131
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,840
rotating the same

132
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,000
but if one starts reading very

133
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
differently that can be an indication

134
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that the filter might be getting clogged

135
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,959
or filled with sediment

136
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,719
now also within our ponds we also want

137
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,799
to be considerate of the

138
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,919
microbes that might be present within

139
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,040
the water

140
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,119
and to remove those a uv light can be

141
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,280
used uv light is an electromatic

142
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,200
radiation with a wavelength of 180

143
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,438
nanometers to 400 nanometers

144
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,439
it is damaging to living organisms

145
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,439
microbes such as bacteria diatoms

146
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,199
floating algae parasitic protozoa

147
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,839
and others will be killed from exposure

148
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,680
to a uv pond filter

149
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,959
dead allergy cells clump together and

150
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
then are trapped in the filter which

151
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,478
reduces the turbidity

152
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,280
and also improves the water clarity and

153
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,000
we can see that

154
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,039
here with fish tank filters uv fishing

155
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,600
filters

156
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
now they do work in the same way but a

157
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,439
uv pond filter typically can handle a

158
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,719
little bit more capacity

159
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,519
so just keep in mind it's the same

160
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,360
concept but a little different setting

161
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,359
now there's two types of these uv pawn

162
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,400
filters uv clarifiers

163
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,080
and uv sterilizers uv clarifiers will

164
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,399
have the light intensity

165
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,159
will have the kind of lighter of

166
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,758
intensity than the sterilizer removing

167
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,840
only bacteria and algae

168
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,280
the sterilizers require water to flow

169
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,239
much slower through them

170
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,359
to ensure more thorough exposure

171
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,439
removing parasitic

172
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,600
protozoa which need a longer exposure

173
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,199
time from the uv light to be killed

174
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
so if you're getting a clarifier

175
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,720
typically they're more higher flow

176
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,959
they're less intensity they're kind of

177
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,600
like like cleaning the water

178
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,839
sterilizing the water to some extent

179
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,479
requires more intense light and slower

180
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,638
flow

181
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,478
so typically you're looking at the

182
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,879
degree of what you may have

183
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,758
to be cleaning out sterilizers would be

184
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,000
preferred

185
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,439
if your system can allow that to be

186
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,959
utilized

187
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,639
then we have the cost of the uv filter

188
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,079
so the low investment is about two three

189
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
hundred dollars with a yearly cost of

190
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,959
about sixty

191
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,038
high investments could be over eight

192
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,519
hundred with a hundred and fifty plus

193
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,680
yearly cost there's installation cost to

194
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,599
consider unit cost electricity the bulb

195
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,280
itself uh that should be changed also

196
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
based on manufacturers recommendations

197
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,918
cost

198
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
so these average costs do not account

199
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,519
for any extra maintenance that might

200
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,079
occur if the uv pine filter is jammed

201
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,758
or in poor condition so again this is

202
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,120
just here to provide you with a general

203
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,240
estimate general uh

204
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,519
kind of idea of what the cost may be

205
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
if you're considering this type of

206
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,359
filtration method and then lastly

207
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,119
talking about that filter or that you

208
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,639
should say that uv bulb itself

209
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
it's recommended that those bulbs are

210
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,759
replaced 60 days before the stated

211
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,038
expiration date

212
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,520
they're kind of similar to grow lights

213
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,599
just because a uv bulb produces light

214
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,439
doesn't mean that it's definitely

215
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,120
necessarily a productive light or as

216
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,000
productive as it once was at doing its

217
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,000
job

218
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,759
if the bulbs are weak they can lead to

219
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,439
bacterial outbreaks or basically not

220
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
perform the

221
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,519
necessarily job that you expect them to

222
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,038
perform depending on the amount of

223
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,279
naturally intended microbes and

224
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,120
macroorganisms

225
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,719
there are different levels of toxicity

226
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,000
with these pawn inhabitants

227
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,360
so that can also play into the amount of

228
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,199
time you're running the filter

229
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
anytime the bulb is on amount of water

230
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,240
you're pushing through it all these

231
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,840
factors come into consideration

232
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,000
but hopefully this provides you just a

233
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,959
general overview to get you by some of

234
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,879
those

235
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,719
initial steps so if you're choosing to

236
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,000
implement this you can implement it in

237
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,000
an effective way
