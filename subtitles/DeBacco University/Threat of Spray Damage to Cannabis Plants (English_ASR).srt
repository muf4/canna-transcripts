00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,359
going to look at the threat of spray

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,040
damage to your cannabis plants

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,960
and how you can kind of factor should be

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,960
aware of and it can avoid this potential

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,239
issue

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,279
[Music]

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,519
all right let's look at the threat of

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,759
spray damage to cannabis plants

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,118
first off sometimes good intentions can

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,279
lead to damage

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,399
so when applying anything to plants be

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,278
sure it's worthwhile

14
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,039
if there is always risk of damage make

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,320
applications at times of low light and

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,000
reduce plant stress

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,238
to reduce the chance of damaging the

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,320
plants do not make applications because

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,320
you think the plant needs something

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
be product specific and spray with a

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,200
purpose meaning spray with something you

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,120
know the plants need

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,120
uh for a given reason if you're just

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,759
kind of like i think they need this

25
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,479
that risk to reward factor is definitely

26
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,599
in the chance

27
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,479
a greater risk than reward so what are

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,920
some sources

29
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,038
of plant damage so while many products

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,879
can be mixed sometimes

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,640
interactions can occur and this can

32
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,000
result in two products that are not

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,400
damaging on their own

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,200
can have phytotoxicity when they are

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,478
mixed

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,000
sometimes this can be seen upon

37
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,679
immediate mixture if you look at the

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,438
container before you go and apply it

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,118
other times it's only when it's applied

40
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,798
so be mindful of that

41
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,478
be cautious with any new mixes and

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,159
materials be sure to read the label of

43
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,840
both manufacturers product

44
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
for any possible interactions and

45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
warnings also

46
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,599
be mindful of the method of application

47
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,719
whether it's a low pressure mister here

48
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,199
or a high pressure

49
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,959
gas-powered mister this is a great for

50
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,478
fogging an area but if the plants are

51
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,599
too close this could also cause some

52
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,118
physical damage to the plants

53
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,280
you using a spreader sticker to your

54
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,840
applications spreader stickers are great

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,359
additions to help coat the leaf surface

56
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
and increase the effectiveness of

57
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,438
products however a little goes a long

58
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,319
way with these items so do not over add

59
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,519
them

60
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,599
also with the increase in product

61
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,438
to the plant surface interaction this

62
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,359
can improve efficiency of products

63
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,199
so when in doubt go with the lower range

64
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,319
of concentrations if one is provided by

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,840
the manufacturer

66
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,438
i mean if the manufacturer gives you a

67
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,080
range i'll apply this from this rate to

68
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:09,439
this rate

69
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,039
and you're using utilizing a spreader

70
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,520
sticker you might be able to favor that

71
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,079
kind of

72
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,879
lower end of the range to not only use

73
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
less product

74
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,239
use less potential for contamination but

75
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,680
still get the same effectiveness because

76
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,039
you'll get a better coverage

77
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
here we can see an area where really

78
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,919
spreader sticker really isn't used

79
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,878
because all the water is in distinct

80
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,079
droplets

81
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,159
spreader sticker will cause it to kind

82
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,879
of form a sheet of water over the entire

83
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,000
leaf surface

84
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,598
improving the interaction now that

85
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
method of application i hinted to

86
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,639
earlier

87
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,479
when applying products to your plants a

88
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,318
forest spray application can increase

89
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,000
the likelihood of damage

90
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,759
mist blowers as i showed you earlier are

91
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
great for large operations

92
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,759
but be sure the true force of the air

93
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,479
blast is not applied directly to the

94
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,199
plants

95
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,840
stand back several feet a mist of

96
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,399
material

97
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,479
is all that's needed so position the

98
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,719
application to minimize potential

99
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,079
plant damage by physically forcing that

100
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,560
application

101
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
onto the leaves now you want to watch

102
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,039
out for young plant parts just in

103
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,959
general

104
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,639
when making an application you may want

105
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
to avoid the newest growing portions of

106
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,039
a plant

107
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,640
as these are not fully expanded it will

108
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,280
likely be the most sensitive to spray

109
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,518
products

110
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
and will likely become damaged damaging

111
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,280
new plant growth has also long-term

112
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
negative impacts on plant performance

113
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,479
because you could be damaging your

114
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,199
apical growing meristem or your side

115
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,119
branches

116
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:28,000
reducing the amount of plate material

117
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,158
you're going to get as you would expect

118
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,080
so lastly spraying during flowering the

119
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,759
flowering phase we can see right here

120
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,519
while you should be careful at any time

121
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,079
you're making applications to your

122
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,840
plants

123
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
during the flowering phase warrants

124
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,719
extra caution

125
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,878
late season spraying can increase the

126
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,000
likelihood of plants failing inspection

127
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:45,919
for pesticides

128
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,519
also you don't want to negatively impact

129
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,679
your final product

130
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,959
so while not advised it can be done just

131
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,640
with even more caution

132
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,719
than during other stages of plant

133
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,399
development so again be mindful what

134
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,120
you're spraying spray with a purpose

135
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,879
be careful of your application make sure

136
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,599
in the end you're doing more benefits to

137
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,079
the plant

138
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,079
than potential risk or harm to the plant
