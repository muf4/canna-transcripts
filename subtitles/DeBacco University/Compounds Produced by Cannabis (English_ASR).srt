1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,198
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:08,318
going to go over the some of the

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:08,318
compounds produced by the cannabis plant

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,920
[Music]

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,480
all right let's get into some compounds

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,320
produced by cannabis so first off can

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,920
produces many compounds i can't cover

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,000
them all here i'm just going to touch on

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,920
some of the major highlights because

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,640
cannabis is a complex plant with over

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,720
500 chemical entities more than 100 of

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,960
them are cannabid compounds alone some

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,640
of them actually have opposing effects

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,359
even though cannabis has been used and

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,120
cultivated by mankind for at least 6 000

16
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,039
years our current knowledge of its

17
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,280
pharmaceutical properties is based on

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,600
studies which may have taken place only

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
since the end of the 19th century so

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,280
basically we have a lot more to learn

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,879
about this plant and some of the

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
compounds that it's producing and how

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,640
they may best be utilized

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,558
so first i'll start with some of the

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,239
physical structures the trichomes as we

26
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,159
can see right here these are the

27
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,718
physical structures that contain the

28
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,959
cannabinoids of flavonoids and terpenes

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,960
so while these chemicals are going to be

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,798
produced or chemicals will be produced

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,199
over the course of the plant really it's

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,240
these trichomes these structures here

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,159
that we're going to be looking at these

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,640
small looks like little white almost

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,320
like sugar dots so to speak these areas

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,079
right here these trichomes and that's

37
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,359
where most of the cannabinoids that

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,920
we're looking for pharmaceutical

39
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,280
purposes are going to be produced in the

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,719
plant

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
so let's start with the first one kind

42
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,400
of the one probably most people

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,960
associate with cannabis and that's thc

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,118
or tetrahydrocannabinol

45
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,959
this is the psychoactive compound that

46
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,599
generates the marijuana or typically

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,478
high feeling as generated it's the

48
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,199
greater percent thc the more potent the

49
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,719
strain thc can also act as an appetite

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,359
suppressant with also some medical

51
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,798
benefits such as anti-anxiety and this

52
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,719
is kind of what the chemical structure

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,799
here looks like of tetrahydrocannabinol

54
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,280
now cbd something else you've probably

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,040
heard a lot about um cannabidiol that's

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,799
how that's pronounced i try to pronounce

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,840
provide a pronunciation i should say

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,520
here

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,680
so you can kind of

60
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,560
deconstruct these very long and complex

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,520
terms

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,439
the cbd is a non-psychoactive chemical

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
component basically doesn't get you high

64
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,039
has many medical benefits such as

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,759
suppressing seizures pain relief and

66
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,400
improved sleep often cbd extraction is

67
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,359
used to make oils edibles or topicals

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,840
for different medical benefits with also

69
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,560
the ease of application for the user

70
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,800
more so than just the dry flour

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,878
then can get to the thc compared or

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,200
versus cbd and these are both

73
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,439
cannabinoids produced by cannabis and we

74
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,639
could see here kind of the

75
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,199
if you will the original molecule cbga

76
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:48,399
can then be through the plant made into

77
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:51,199
thc or cbd so a lot of growers were also

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,519
looking at cbg dominant varieties so

79
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,159
they could make whatever ratio that they

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,158
were that they deemed desirable

81
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,400
keep in mind though plants with high thc

82
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,280
produce that strong euphoric high can

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,800
also do

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,719
feelings of anxiety as well as dizziness

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,239
plants with high cbds

86
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,000
lack that euphoric high and have great

87
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,560
medical benefits potential for pain

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,759
inflammation epsilon c as well as

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,439
seizures so cbd a lot especially

90
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,679
younger children has been shown to

91
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,560
reduce seizures and that's what

92
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,879
hopefully helps gain some popularity

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,120
here in the medical community

94
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,719
now in addition to just those we have

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,000
thcv

96
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,840
tetrahydrocannabin which produces a

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,919
trippy high that comes on quick and is

98
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,000
often associated with a caffeine rush

99
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,399
because of its high energy compound

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,239
however keep in mind that thcv must

101
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,239
reach

102
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,319
428 degrees fahrenheit in order to be

103
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,400
activated it may help with blood sugar

104
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,000
regulation as well however if you suffer

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,920
from anxiety it would be advised to stay

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,199
away from varieties that have elevated

107
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,318
levels of thcv just a word of caution

108
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,878
there

109
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:01,280
they may have cbn which is

110
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,560
cannabinol not well documented at the

111
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,759
current time but shares some

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,598
characteristics of cbd with less potency

113
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,679
it does show promise as a sleep aid and

114
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,919
is typically found in low percentages

115
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,599
and needs to be professionally isolated

116
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,918
from the plant material then we have cbg

117
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,079
so as i mentioned before one that gains

118
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,279
some popularity simply because it's kind

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,720
of that stem cell molecule of thc and

120
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,478
cbd and it's pronounced cannabinoid

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,600
this compound is gaining popularity

122
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,918
since it's the precursor to thc cbd as

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,919
well as cbc as well some other minor

124
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,439
cannabinoids it's not present in high

125
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,519
amounts because it's quickly converted

126
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,680
by the plant to other compounds but it

127
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,279
does show promise to reduce inflammation

128
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
as an ant also can be used as an

129
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,559
antibacterial agent and along with some

130
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,319
other medical benefits vossen often been

131
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,519
referred to as the stem cell of cannabis

132
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,839
and could serve as the building block

133
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,680
for many compounds and this is why some

134
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,359
growers get really interested in

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,040
breeding this simply because it's that

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
starting point it's that early point

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
that then if they had a lot of that they

138
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,759
could then figure out these different

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,918
synthases and produce

140
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,840
the ratios of compounds they wanted in

141
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,918
the

142
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,758
end then we get to terpenes so

143
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,758
terpenes are aromatic

144
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,319
organic compounds which are typically

145
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,240
oils that are increased in the trichomes

146
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,159
of the plant they naturally occur in

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,319
plants to reduce herbivore feeding and

148
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,080
increase odds of pollination these

149
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,839
compounds produce the unique flavors

150
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,758
colors and smells of the plant but of

151
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,439
course are not limited to cannabis you

152
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
can see here pine sap

153
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,759
we are familiar with that

154
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,520
aroma associated with pine trees that is

155
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,000
an example of another plant producing

156
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,758
these terpenes and then lastly we have a

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,279
flavonoids here

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,199
and these are a group of natural

159
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,559
substances with variable phenolic

160
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,639
structures and are found in fruits

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,439
vegetables grains bark roots stems

162
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,800
flowers tea and also wine these are

163
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,879
compounds that are responsible for the

164
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,439
color and aroma of flowers and can also

165
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,879
help attract pollinators in addition

166
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,439
they can protect plants from different

167
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,360
biotic and abiotic stresses can act as

168
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,038
uv light filters for example

169
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,879
anthocyanins we can kind of see that

170
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,318
here poison ivy might be feeling with is

171
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,240
usually a green leaf

172
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,160
here when it first emerges has a lot of

173
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,240
red tones to it that's its way of

174
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,960
protecting or shielding itself from the

175
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,759

00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,680

177
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,520
may offer some synergistic effects but

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,720
of course more research is needed and

179
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,560
hopefully that research will be

180
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,039
occurring uh with the gaining of

181
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,280
popularity within the medical community

182
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:35,199
of just unlocking some of the powers

183

that the cannabis plant may have
