1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,960
now while a firearm at a crime scene is

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,040
a viable piece of information

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,199
there is evidence that goes beyond the

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,160
firearm that investigators need to be

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,839
mindful of

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,679
a lot of times this gets a lot of

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,119
attention but let's look at some of the

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,560
evidence you can get

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,000
even beyond just a firearm so first off

10
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,000
looking at the firearm yes there's make

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,359
there's models but if we want to handle

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,198
that very carefully

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,560
because fingerprints may also be found

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,640
on the gun itself

15
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,559
they can also be found on the casings

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,640
but usable prints are rarely found

17
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,600
on the actual firearm into also because

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,679
you may have

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,160
a lot of heat developed that could ruin

20
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,399
some of those oils that are deposited

21
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,238
obliterated or altered firearm sealer

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,840
numbers can sometimes be restored

23
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,919
so this is something else that kind of

24
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,960
identifies the gun as being unique that

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,480
serial number

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,079
firearms can be test-fired to obtain

27
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,878
known specimens for comparison to

28
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,320
evidence

29
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,198
ammunition components such as bullets

30
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,679
cartridge cases and also

31
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,119
shot shell casings as well so again you

32
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,679
have a lot of things to gain more than

33
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,718
just the

34
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,799
physical firearm itself

35
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,280
now we also have a trigger pull

36
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,560
examination so what does that refer to

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
well regardless of the gun there'll be a

38
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,439
certain amount of pressure need to apply

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
for that trigger so firearms examinators

40
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:15,919
can determine the general conditions of

41
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,599
the firearm

42
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,519
and whether the firearm is mechanically

43
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,039
functional the trigger pull examination

44
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,319
can determine the amount of pressure

45
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
necessary to release the hammer and

46
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,438
firing from the firearm

47
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,798
it will measure how much how many pounds

48
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,158
it takes to pull the trigger

49
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,920
to allow the firing to go through and to

50
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,200
send the bullet down the barrel

51
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
examiners can determine whether the

52
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,799
firearm was altered

53
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,719
to fire the full automatic mode as well

54
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,320
so not only may some people choose to

55
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,640
modify the actual trigger pull

56
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,000
they could also modify it so that one

57
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,879
pull the trigger will fight

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,359
fire multiple rounds as in like a full

59
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,399
automatic weapon

60
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,640
we have the gauge and also manufacturer

61
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,159
so the shot pellets the buckshot slugs

62
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,840
examiners have shot pellets buckshot and

63
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,118
slugs can determine the size of the shot

64
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
the gauge of the slug and the

65
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,959
manufacturer

66
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,040
by simply finding that also at the crime

67
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,560
scene through the investigative process

68
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,080
the wadding may also be found and

69
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
examinators of watting components can

70
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
determine the gauge and manufacture

71
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,439
remember that wadding is just simply

72
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,040
that kind of plastic components

73
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,959
that's kind of holding kind of a bunch

74
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,359
of small bbs or pellets

75
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,120
together so even though it might just be

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
a small little plastic piece when you

77
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,680
find that

78
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,919
that can be used to kind of go back and

79
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,120
try to determine the potential

80
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:34,479
gauge in manufacture that was

81
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,959
used as far as propellant

82
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,159
lastly a firearm accessories so there's

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,759
different ways to modify

84
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,280
certain firearms or people may choose to

85
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,280
modify certain firearms

86
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,039
the shop pattern examiners can determine

87
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,878
the approximate distance at which a

88
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,840
shotgun was fired by testing specific

89
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,959
firearm ammunition combinations at known

90
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,959
points

91
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
between two points how far was that

92
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,680
shooter away

93
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,119
how close were they what was the

94
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,760
distance what was kind of what were they

95
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,719
using

96
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,719
um can be very important silencers as we

97
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,479
see here attach to these and again it's

98
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,560
not just your can be used

99
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,479
to hand guns and not just your large or

100
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,318
long rifles here this is a cutaway

101
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,919
what a silencer may look like there are

102
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,439
attachments that can be reduced the

103
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,878
noise of the firearm by suppressing the

104
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,639
sound during firing

105
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,000
tests can be determined whether a muzzle

106
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,518
attachment can be classified as the

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,598
silencer upon measuring this

108
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,560
the sound reduction there's also other

109
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,318
gun parts in

110
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
that it can be examined to determine the

111
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,158
caliber or model of the gun

112
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,400
and what parts were originated what

113
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,318
modifications were made

114
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
again all these little factors come into

115
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,158
play they go just beyond the

116
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,039
standard shotgun manufacturer or handgun

117
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,798
manufacturer

118
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,560
rifle manufacturer there's a lot of

119
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,360
other things to take in consideration

120
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,120
so while finding the firearm is great a

121
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,400
good investigator will be able to take

122
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,799
these other factors

123
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,239
into consideration to try to pinpoint

124
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,599
and make matches

125
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,680
as far as what may have actually

126
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,679
occurred during the crime scene
