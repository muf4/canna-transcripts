00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,678
something that's typically thought of

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,960
more in outdoor growing operations is

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,719
crop consulting

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,120
however within the cannabis industry

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,759
this can also apply to indoor growing as

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:11,839
well

7
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,519
so stay tuned in this tobacco university

video to learn just more about this

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
potential job opportunity

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,278
[Music]

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,118
all right let's get into crop consulting

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,800
in the cannabis industry remember this

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,118
is applicable both to indoor

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,558
as well as outdoor growing environments

15
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,640
so first off the job description

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,399
consultants assist growers

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,079
the selection of plant material and can

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,160
offer what may work best

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,600
for the growers given conditions this

20
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,359
typically involves field-based

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
evaluations of growing practices in

22
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,679
season

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,600
but can also be applied to indoor

24
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,640
growing operations as well

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,120
as far as maybe ceiling height or area

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,280
as can be taken into consideration and

27
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,038
suggestions can be made as far as

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,960
what plants or what varieties what

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,039
cultivars might be the best selection

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
to choose to fit that particular

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,320
environment

32
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,319
the day-to-day activities of a crop

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,079
consultant address patient

34
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,079
concerns and questions regarding the

35
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,640
challenges that may be seeing currently

36
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,118
in the growing environment so if we're

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,519
seeing like a really windy area

38
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,040
or an area that floods easily you know

39
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,759
timing your plantings maybe going with

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,680
autoflowers

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,280
suggestions that way provide product

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,479
expertise and knowledge to growers by

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,239
offering suggestions

44
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,840
to help alleviate current issues that

45
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,679
may be observed

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
maintain privacy and confidentiality of

47
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,118
sensitive information because some of

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,280
this information might be

49
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,719
kind of kind of that developed

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
particularly an indoor growing

51
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,920
that might have certain patents

52
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,000
protecting it or things like that so

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,519
maintaining that confidentiality

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,359
accurately entering all providing data

55
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,719
such as soil tests yields

56
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,478
irrigation to help develop a

57
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,840
personalized plan of action

58
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,200
for that particular grower now qualities

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
a person must have looking at crop

60
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,799
consulting crop consulting in general

61
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,759
positive attitude and strong work ethic

62
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,520
because you do have to go out and

63
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
usually visit a lot of different farms

64
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,718
can hail the weather extremes while out

65
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
in the field during the entire year the

66
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,319
cold the hot the rain

67
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,478
the humidity the lack of humidity all

68
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,399
those need to be into consideration

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,080
familiarity with their state's medical

70
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,680
marijuana program and laws to know

71
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,360
what's legal what can be advised

72
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
to the people growing extensive

73
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,319
knowledge on the different strains

74
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:19,598
available and the conditions they may

75
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,759
prefer

76
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,919
some strains is good knowledge to have

77
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,598
to be able to pass on potential growers

78
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,679
ability to recognize signs of potential

79
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,878
problems in the future to mitigate those

80
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,599
or minimize their

81
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,518
total negative effect now the connection

82
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,959
in general to the cannabis industry

83
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,719
is that cannabis consultants are a

84
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,878
direct link between the growers

85
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,878
and their crop being able to recognize

86
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,598
current and potential problems and offer

87
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,560
corrective measures is very important in

88
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,560
addition being

89
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,920
available to growers to ensure potential

90
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,640
sudden problems that may not have been

91
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,039
foreseen

92
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,759
can be addressed when timing may be key

93
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,280
to control

94
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,199
is an issue and this could be based on

95
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
quick email photograph

96
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,560
something to offer that grower that

97
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,519
might be seeing a problem developing

98
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
very quickly

99
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,519
to hopefully get them ahead of that

100
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,719
potential issue and reduce the total

101
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,319
negative impact

102
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,919
so again crop consulting typically

103
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,359
thought of as an outdoor growing

104
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,518
environment with cannabis

105
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,640
can also be applicable to an indoor

106
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,640
environment as well
