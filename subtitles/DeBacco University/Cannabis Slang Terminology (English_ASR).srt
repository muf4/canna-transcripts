1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
okay I'm gonna go over some cannabis

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:07,588
slang terminology while there are many

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:09,629
slang terms out there I've chosen just a

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,109
couple select few to highlight in this

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,429
video lecture series so first off try

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:17,489
the most obvious that most people

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,339
couldn't connector really is the number

8
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:23,669
420 well as the story goes through this

9
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:25,410
story behind 420 is that in 1971 five

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,929
high school students in San Rafael

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,629
California calling themselves the Waldos

12
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:32,820
used the term in connection with a plan

13
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,649
to search for an abandoned cannabis crop

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,509
so they're planning on going and

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,570
searching for this rumored crop to be in

16
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:41,789
the area they designated the Louis

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,460
Pasteur's statue at the high school

18
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:47,339
grounds as their meeting place and 4:20

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,230
p.m. as their meeting time after several

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,260
failed attempts they never did find that

21
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:55,589
rumored or abandoned cannabis crop the

22
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,718
group evolved 4:20 into a code word that

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,789
the teams used to mean the consumption

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,820
of cannabis that's kind of the

25
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,489
background of 4/20 this is kind of where

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,000
originated out in California it was

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,130
actually a group of high school students

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,590
we heard the term veg used a lot those

29
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,868
edges well veg is simply abbreviation

30
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,490
for a vegetative growth it's referring

31
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,950
to the stages of the plant development

32
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:23,158
that produces leaves not flowers this is

33
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,820
associated with a light cycle of 16 to

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,469
24 hours of continuous light so 16 to 24

35
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,609
hours when people plant in the veg I'll

36
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:35,609
keep the vegetative flower is the actual

37
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:38,009
trimmed bud so it's the actual product

38
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:40,709
post ribbon as you can see here so we

39
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,750
referred to as the flower it's preferred

40
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,789
to see the actual portion of the plant

41
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,618
and we're saying the flower don't think

42
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,618
of a beautiful nice pretty flower it's

43
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:52,438
the actual final trimmed product which

44
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:56,069
in this case typically does not have any

45
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,779
seeds we hear the term phenyl hunting

46
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,639
you know some growers are going phenyl

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,609
hunting well this is searching for a

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,829
specific characteristic mystery free no

49
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,868
is short for phenotype so it's phenotype

50
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:09,199
hunting what these growers are doing is

51
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:11,848
a phenotype is an observable physical

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,679
characteristic of an individual which is

53
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:15,840
the result of the interactions of two

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,420
the environment when growing many

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,729
individuals from across there will be

56
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,738
some variability so breeders may want to

57
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:24,929
select the best individual to continue

58
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,849
breeding that line as a result it will

59
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,340
Fino hunt or they'll be looking for

60
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:31,768
particular characteristics that they

61
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,280
will may then clone and use in future

62
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,840
breeding work at cloning process as I

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,180
mentioned cloning is producing

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,408
genetically identical individuals so

65
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,079
it's true whether it's cannabis or

66
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:45,388
anything else producing more of the same

67
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,639
plants can easily be cloned which allows

68
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,409
for many copies of a unique individual

69
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,030
so if you have a whole population of

70
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:53,068
plants and you have one there that

71
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,389
really stands out and for whatever

72
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:56,280
reason you want to clone that and

73
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:59,819
reproduce those traits well that's very

74
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,400
easy to do with cannabis we hear mothers

75
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,378
or mother plants typically sometimes are

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,919
called stock plants and they're used for

77
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:09,298
cloning or breeding purposes the mother

78
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,639
plants are stock plants that are kept in

79
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,730
the vegetative stage development to

80
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,030
allow clones to be taken for propagation

81
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:19,918
it's allowing those individuals to be

82
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,079
mass multiplied and especially if you

83
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,669
find a unique trait may want to continue

84
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:26,849
an entire crop of that particular trait

85
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:29,370
turps

86
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,858
house is short for terpenes are fake

87
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,688
fragrant aromatic compounds produced by

88
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,260
the cannabis plant they provide that

89
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:38,908
unique taste and interact

90
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:41,158
synergistically with compounds in the

91
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:42,750
plant such as cannabinoids drippings are

92
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,209
naturally produced to repel predators

93
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,280
and attract pollinators these compounds

94
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,680
can be infected by the climate the age

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,699
and nutrient profile that the plant is

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,859
receiving newts is it reassured for

97
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,650
nutrients or fertilizers and this is the

98
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:01,560
basic food for the plants to grow

99
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,019
newts could be organic fertilizers or

100
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,280
nutrients that can be synthetics just

101
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,879
referring to the general classification

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,128
of nutrients or fertilisers nuns are as

103
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,198
a trimmed blood or a nugget that is the

104
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:15,478
smokeable part of the flower it is of

105
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,769
high quality it can refer to the entire

106
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,079
flower but more commonly applied to

107
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,180
large or small pieces of that particular

108
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,009
flower well there are a lot of slang

109
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,629
terms to indicate high quality cannabis

110
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:32,730
nugs also spelled with 1g would be

111
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:34,350
indication of high-quality hoji kind of

112
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,569
some debate on what this may stand for

113
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,580
ocean grown Aboriginal gangster or

114
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:41,219
organically grown it's kind of a debated

115
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,349
topic ocean grown support is that one

116
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,360
the cush is trade which came from the

117
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,070
Hindu Kush mountains over in Asia was

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,500
brought to the west coast of the United

119
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:52,290
States the terpenes and effects changed

120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,360
leading to the term OG Kush to indicate

121
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,939
where it was grown in what effects to

122
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,660
expect this is kind of support of OG

123
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:02,459
referring to ocean grown however was

124
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,830
also support that OG stands for original

125
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:06,719
gangster support is that originated in

126
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:08,969
Los Angeles where og stands for original

127
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,560
gangster which is where the Kush was

128
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,940
first became popularized or originated

129
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,030
masa oh gee could sanfur organically

130
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,980
grown which matches the general produce

131
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:22,259
abbreviation but there's no official

132
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,450
organic standards set for cannabis at

133
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,939
this time since just recently became

134
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,610
friendly legal so it's unlikely this is

135
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,079
the true meaning this whole goal was to

136
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,569
provide to it as a couple the slang

137
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,399
terminology used for cannabis and again

138
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,930
there's much more this hopefully be a

139
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,739
little bit of a background of some terms

140
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,740
that you may have heard
