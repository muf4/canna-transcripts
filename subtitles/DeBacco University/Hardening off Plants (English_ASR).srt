1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
here and talk about hardening off plants

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:06,810
which is basically toughening up the

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,960
plant structure to be able to hand

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:11,579
handle a harsher condition typically

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,070
this is when I go from the protective

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,570
environment of a clone room to maybe an

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,820
outside environment or a greenhouse

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,560
environment so hardening off this

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,600
process provide plants with increased

10
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,368
exposure to environmental stresses it

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,800
could be light to allow for easier

12
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,990
transition could be intense light like I

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,179
said outside light could be drier

14
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:32,429
conditions outside environments or

15
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:34,019
greenhouse there's a lot of stresses

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,420
that plants can go through and typically

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,609
when they're very small we may baby them

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,320
and we need to kind of go through a

19
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:43,769
hurting off process so we don't damage

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,200
them necessary for indoor ceilings that

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,059
are grown for an outdoor operation where

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,370
they'll be getting intense sunlight and

23
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,169
typically low humidity levels so

24
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:55,078
micophone I screen house would be

25
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,340
protected to the outside environment can

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,259
also go for maybe a cloning room which

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,449
is really high humidity to a greenhouse

28
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:04,140
that might have lower humidity increase

29
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:05,879
amounts of light intensity the light

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,530
change so even in indoor facilities

31
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,478
going from florescent lights to high

32
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,189
pressure high discharge lights which is

33
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,019
this high-pressure sodium light may

34
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,228
require a transition process to avoid

35
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:17,670
burning in the leaves this produces

36
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:20,670
great lights in both cases but this is a

37
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,759
much more plant friendly light than the

38
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,210
high pressure sodium is here so this

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,319
could also require a transition period

40
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:29,759
lastly the main goal is to toughen

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,408
plants leaves to reduce the chance of

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,540
leaf burner try to prevent this from

43
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,978
occurring that is from occurring when

44
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,259
plants are going from different light

45
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,868
levels intensity Zoar humidities from

46
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,728
moisture levels this is kind of a grower

47
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:43,349
error I would call it in the sense that

48
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,239
if you know your plants going to be

49
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,429
transitioning or any changing lights or

50
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,949
doing something you got to provide the

51
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,439
plants time to kind of work their way to

52
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,780
toughen the outer skin there so you

53
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,718
don't get this burned issue that can

54
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,579
easily occur through the process of not

55
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:01,819
allowing the plan to transfer to a new

56
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,819
environment
