1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,769
this video is on the animal phylum

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,390
echinodermata now as you can tell by the

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:08,638
duration this video it's not very long

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,259
but that was worth mentioning and at

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,379
least devoting a little couple slides to

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:15,509
in a little time Dale so first off what

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,960
does this exactly mean its refers to

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:21,868
spiny skin of the endoskeleton of the

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,868
calcium-rich obstacles just beneath the

10
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:26,849
in the kind of terms of skin these are

11
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:29,189
entirely marine animals they live

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,528
entirely in the ocean they include sea

13
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,049
stars sea urchins sand dollars in sea

14
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,759
cucumbers what's an interesting fact

15
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:38,339
about these is that they're bilaterally

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,859
symmetrical as larvae but become a

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,960
radial symmetry as adults radial

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,969
symmetry refer to that anywhere through

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,109
the midpoint a to draw a plane they're

20
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,719
symmetrical

21
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,840
but they're bilayers symmetrical as

22
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,789
larvae just a general overview here of

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,219
the anatomy again nothing that I'm going

24
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,109
to focus on particularly in class but

25
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,239
again if we do a dissection are really

26
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,609
just to appreciate some of the anatomy

27
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,899
of these animals I've included the

28
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,899
picture here at the end
