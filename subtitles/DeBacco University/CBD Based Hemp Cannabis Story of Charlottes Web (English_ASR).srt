1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,760
in this tobacco university video we're

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,480
going to be exploring

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,918
the cbd based hemp cannabis giving you a

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,080
little bit of background of

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,839
the summary of the story of charlotte's

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,919
web as

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,079
charlotte here is thought to be one of

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,559
the great contributors

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,599
to science to be able to really help

10
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,640
support and really

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,439
start a whole wave looking really at cbd

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,080
for potential

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
medical treatments so first off well who

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,598
is charlotte

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,880
figgy here and we see her pictured here

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,920
she was a child with

17
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,280
uh catastrophic type of epsilopsy she

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,160
became a symbol of positive

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
impacts that cbd can have on individuals

20
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,439
particularly young

21
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,199
children in this example charlotte had

22
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,320
juvederm which is a rare form

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,359
of epilepsy sadly she did pass away

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,359
in april 7th in the year 2020 at only

25
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,799
the age of 13.

26
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,359
her cause of death is thought to be

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,359
pneumonia but in that short

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,640
life that she did have she did have a

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,000
great contribution

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,920
here to the cannabis industry so she had

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,680
that rare form of

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
epilepsy which is basically that duvet

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,479
syndrome which is a

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,560
kind of seizures that start very early

35
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,920
on during the first year of life

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
this is kind of showing brain wave

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,560
patterns of a seizure child at the age

38
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:22,158
of six was having a seizure about every

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,320
30 minutes so not only were they

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,159
potentially very severe but they were

41
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,599
reoccurring at a very short

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,359
intervals so over two years her parents

43
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,359
paige and matt had tried many different

44
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,799
things they sought out a lot of

45
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,239
advice and medical kind of advice from

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,600
different doctors

47
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,118
and they tried a whole bunch of

48
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,280
different things you know diet

49
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,118
alterations acupuncture drugs

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,599
with really no changes from any of the

51
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,599
above really sadly at the peak trout was

52
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,599
having about 300 seizures a week or

53
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,919
about two every hour

54
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,640
and at certain times was not talking not

55
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,159
moving

56
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
and then doctors really were looking at

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,799
some very experimental

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,799
type options however half a world away

59
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,000
matt the father was deployed to

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,399
afghanistan

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,159
and he was researching online and he

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,639
found evidence that candice may help

63
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,959
reduce seizures so it's kind of just he

64
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,719
was in afghanistan and a lot of areas

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,479
where potentially cannabis or certain

66
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,560
forms of cannabis may have originated

67
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,719
there's a kind of connection there we

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,959
thank him for his service as well

69
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,159
uh and this this leads us to the stanley

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,239
brothers so how are they

71
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,919
involved with charlotte's story well

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,200
this daily brothers were marijuana

73
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,639
growers in colorado and they were

74
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,039
cross-breeding a stream of marijuana

75
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,639
that's

76
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,878
high in cbd and low in thc and remember

77
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,839
thc is that psychoactive ingredient

78
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,639
their focus was to breed down the thc

79
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,840
and breed

80
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,839
up in concentration the cbd

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,120
they were able to achieve a cb level of

82
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,319
about 21

83
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,480
while still mean maintaining a thc level

84
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,759
under one percent and that's a very

85
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,399
stark difference

86
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,199
between those two cannabinoid levels the

87
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,959
reason was

88
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,560
not for recreational smoking which is

89
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,400
typically associated with thc

90
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,479
but for the potential for medical

91
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,360
benefits so the stanley brothers were

92
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,359
really seeking

93
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,200
the highest grade of kind of medical

94
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,040
cannabinoids and here looking at the cbd

95
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,399
breeding that up in concentration

96
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,759
while reducing the thc levels

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,319
so we're looking at this kind of flower

98
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:25,919
extract extraction so the

99
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,798
mother went to a local denver colorado

100
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,199
dispensary

101
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,920
and purchased some high cbd variety

102
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,439
cannabis

103
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,119
the owner were actually surprised of the

104
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,039
request since nobody really wanted it

105
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,799
because it didn't have really any effect

106
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,318
that high cbd level doesn't really have

107
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,719
that psychoactive high

108
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,560
that low thc and high cbd really lacks

109
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,799
that recreational kind of

110
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
psychoactive high thought to be

111
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,400
potentially with what was called

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,719
r4 at the time had a cbd level of 17.61

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,959
and a thc level under one percent of

114
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,719
only 0.76 percent

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,519
however it is important to note that

116
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:02,158
even 0.76 percent by the current

117
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,200
uh 2018 farm bill would still be

118
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,359
considered

119
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,318
federally illegal or marijuana at that

120
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
point

121
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,158
and the mother after taking the flower

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,560
home extracted the cbd

123
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,798
from that flower kind of extracted that

124
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,280
particular compound

125
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,079
now the impact of the actual treatment

126
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,439
the day

127
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,199
that she was given that charlotte was

128
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,839
given the cbd oil treatment under the

129
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,919
tongue

130
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,599
she did not have a seizure that day

131
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,639
which continued into the night and

132
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,240
beyond

133
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,560
overall it was a sharp decline in

134
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,000
seizures it was very notable and again

135
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,319
very positive here

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,759
she went from having 300 seizures a week

137
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,439
to only having one

138
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,120
a week just from this cbd treatment

139
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,519
she went from being on a feeding tube

140
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,519
this is charlotte to eating on her own

141
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,478
and she started talking and also walking

142
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,639
on her own

143
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,159
so this really was an eye-opening

144
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,360
experience at large in the medical

145
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,120
industry as well

146
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,720
that cbd treatment may really provide a

147
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,478
lot of potential

148
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,479
when we're looking at seizures at this

149
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,240
in this example

150
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,879
so looking at does charlotte's web

151
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,360
equals cw2a as this was according to the

152
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,399
u.s

153
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,520
patent and trademark office joe stanley

154
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,959
filed a

155
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,758
joel stanley's filed a patent

156
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,959
application in may 2018 on behalf of his

157
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,680
company

158
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,680
also named charlotte's web so in the

159
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,560
public documents stanley describes a

160
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
plant

161
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,759
type capable of producing 6.24 cbd

162
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,279
content and 0.27 percent thc content

163
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,960
so you're looking at these numbers and

164
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,279
from what i just pre described say it's

165
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,000
much

166
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,959
lower but keep in mind here this is

167
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
staying with

168
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,399
or under that federal limit of 0.3

169
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,360
percent

170
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,239
thc so of course the cbd conservation

171
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,800
was reduced

172
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,759
but still having 6.24 it's a very high

173
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
producing

174
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,720
cbd strain here

175
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,560
and still staying with under that

176
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,400
federal limit

177
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,639
so the patent was actually approved in

178
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,799
july of 2019 and if you

179
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,560
search it on the internet you likely can

180
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,000
probably find this patent

181
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,519
the new cultivar c w 2 a was asexually

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,160
reproduced via stem cuttings of

183
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,719
vegetative

184
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,240
and or flowering plants and cloning by

185
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,919
the inventor and the inventors

186
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,639
greenhouses nurseries fields and our

187
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,799
facilities in colorado springs colorado

188
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,918
according to the patent asexual clones

189
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,400
from the original source have been

190
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,079
tested in greenhouses nurseries fields

191
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,758
the properties of each clone from its

192
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,038
cultivar were found to be

193
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,120
transmissible by such

194
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,038
asexual reproduction the cultivar is

195
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,199
stable and reproduces true to type

196
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,079
in successful generations of asexual

197
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,439
reproduction

198
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,959
so this kind of disproves or shows here

199
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,639
that it wasn't just a one-off plant it

200
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,879
wasn't just one unique individual

201
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,759
it is reproducible through asexual

202
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,079
reproduction

203
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,160
typically using vegetative propagation

204
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,839
known as clones

205
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,000
so plant patent specifics well the

206
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,119
patent was issued by cw holdings as a

207
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,639
plant patent

208
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,720
not a broad broader utility patent

209
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,240
so we want to be careful in the

210
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
definition between those two

211
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,400
this means it is good only for legal

212
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,479
protection against a competitor growing

213
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,959
the same cultivar from clone

214
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,839
even though this may be overall limited

215
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,758
protection

216
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,758
it is groundbreaking and that is the

217
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,319
first and only plant patent

218
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,598
for hemp cultivar issued within the

219
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,120
united states

220
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,439
so this again shows you what the utility

221
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,160
patent covers i'll give you kind of some

222
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,120
descriptions here as far as looking at

223
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,800
you know

224
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
the utility patent this case dependent

225
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
and kind of include all of this

226
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
phenotypes cultivar just to give you

227
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,000
that general overview here but the plant

228
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,918
patent specifics here

229
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,279
and just keep in mind that this is not a

230
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:38,560
broader utility patent they were just

231
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,279
looking for that kind of

232
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
way of protecting for a competitor

233
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,198
growing

234
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,800
the same clone the value of having

235
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,400
this patent here you know what's the

236
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,680
advantage what's why would go through

237
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,959
this process

238
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,800
the patent doesn't prevent others from

239
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,239
developing their own strain of symbol

240
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,879
characteristics so that's an important

241
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,639
note

242
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,400
the goal from the breeder standpoint

243
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,160
though is to protect the strain

244
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,839
you have put time into and resources and

245
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,840
developing protect your specific

246
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,038
strain here the patent does not prevent

247
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,959
a competitor

248
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,240
competition in general but can provide

249
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,399
an advantage in

250
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
the market so that's why it's

251
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,560
advantageous for them to go through

252
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,279
and have that patent for their plant the

253
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,319
specifics

254
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,959
of charlotte's web so is a sativa-based

255
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,080
strain

256
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:25,279
with the state 13 cbd however

257
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,918
the patent does state officially 6.24

258
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,878
cbd and that thc below that zero point

259
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,598
three percent

260
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,519
these unique uh and proprietary genetics

261
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,120
are used by charlotte's web the company

262
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,360
to create extracts for a variety of

263
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,799
health and wellness products

264
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,959
contrary to popular belief charlotte's

265
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,158
web products are hemp derived

266
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:47,039
and are non-intoxicating they lack any

267
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,480
strong levels of thc new consumers

268
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,360
should consult their doctor with any

269
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,159
medical

270
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,000
concerns but this i felt important to

271
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,559
kind of address this story

272
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,839
it did get a national publication and

273
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,599
really gave cannabis

274
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,000
really kind of ideas in the market

275
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,560
to allow doctors to look at it further

276
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,679
and really to investigate the cbd

277
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,439
for its potential medical benefits and

278
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,439
charlotte again sadly in her short life

279
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,360
there was able really to

280
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,040
kind of change radically change the

281
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,800
cannabis industry in people's

282
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,278
perceptions of cannabis

283
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,319
which has led to hopefully continuation

284
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,480
for it to be used

285
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,480
to help other individuals going forward
