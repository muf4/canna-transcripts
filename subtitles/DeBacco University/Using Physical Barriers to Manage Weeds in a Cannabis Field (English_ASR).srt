1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
so this tobacco university video is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,359
going to be looking at some

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,169
physical barriers when it comes to weed

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,859
suppression

5
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:09,859
[Music]

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,640
let's get into using physical barriers

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,519
to manage weeds in a cannabis field

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,640
so often this is cost prohibitive on the

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,399
large scale

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,960
why while it does create a great look to

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,678
the field does create a very clean field

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,039
it does require a lot of material it's

13
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,519
best suited for smaller

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,880
and closer in-row spacing fields not

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,399
only do you need the material but you

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,840
also need kind of ways to kind of hold

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,320
it down so the wind doesn't blow and

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,640
carry

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,159
it away so these needs to be tucked in

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
by bearing the edges

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,439
here we're seeing a bunch of stone

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,078
weights or

23
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,119
cinder blocks or pellets all those need

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,719
to be established

25
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,238
well so that you're not damaging the

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,559
plants if the wind was to kind of shift

27
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,718
or

28
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,640
move that but it does once established

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,000
create a very clean field and really

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,039
eliminates any chance of

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
weeds popping up in this clean field

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,239
that i've talked about

33
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,158
if a physical beer is used for the

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,920
plantings of rose it's also the walking

35
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,920
path can be essentially

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,400
created to a clean field that will

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
reduce the soil splash and possibly

38
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,320
reduce disease as well again it needs to

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,759
be established it needs to be held in

40
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,279
place very well

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,200
so you're not having giant holes so

42
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,519
you're limiting areas where potential

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,600
for weeds can grow but this also reduces

44
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,158
any soil splash in your walking rows as

45
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,359
well

46
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,280
really helps keep your plants very clean

47
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,280
for high traffic areas if your field has

48
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,200
a high traffic using a physical barrier

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,478
creates a carpet-like effect to reduce

50
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
the chance of workers

51
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,000
carrying soil particles from one area to

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
another

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
and this can help reduce the transfer

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,439
soil based diseases

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,200
which can be of concern particularly on

56
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,959
larger growing applications

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
here we see typically garden months are

58
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,438
grown in this way and they're grown in

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,959
containers

60
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,798
so this doesn't necessarily mean when

61
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,718
using a physical barrier the plants have

62
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,719
to be physically planted in the soil

63
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,718
they can be used with container growing

64
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,158
as well also makes it really easy to

65
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,000
move the plants

66
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,600
throughout and take them and load them

67
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,319
up or move them from one field to

68
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,799
another

69
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,679
so again does offer some benefits but

70
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
keep in mind that

71
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,120
initial establishment and upfront cost

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
can be

73
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,039
drawbacks lastly the timing of the

74
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,598
physical barrier is

75
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,280
also very important at the time of

76
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,639
planting the physical barrier should be

77
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
applied at that time

78
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,399
this can be a challenge as it's when

79
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,520
typically growers are the most busy

80
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
this will help increase the

81
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,719
effectiveness and reduce the

82
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,920
frustrations preventing it from shifting

83
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,359
during the season

84
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,199
a lot of times growers want to just

85
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,599
plant all their plants then go back

86
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,199
later and add their physical barrier

87
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,639
sometimes even the best intentions don't

88
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,318
really get fulfilled

89
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,919
also if you're planting a large scale

90
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,560
planting and your initial plants are

91
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,318
growing

92
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
it can make it very difficult to go

93
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,719
through and kind of re-add that

94
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,000
barrier almost as we see here here when

95
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,280
the plants are small if everything's

96
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,759
tucked in and established

97
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,680
as those plants now grow and get larger

98
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,318
they're taking full advantage of that

99
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,560
use

100
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,479
of the physical barrier keep in mind by

101
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,158
looking at your physical barrier

102
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,518
they can last for different periods of

103
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,759
time some

104
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,519
are more porous than others so take this

105
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,719
into consideration as well

106
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,120
when you're if you're selecting a

107
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,519
physical barrier which one is the best

108
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,640
fit

109
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
for your application
