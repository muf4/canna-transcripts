1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,349
all right here we're gonna look at oil

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,878
in sweat glands and hopefully by the end

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:08,308
of this we'll be able to provide a

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,768
comparison between oil-producing glands

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,359
and sweat producing glands now let's say

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,679
oil this is actually vegetable oil but

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,469
just trying to give you that visual

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,329
comparison between the tail mostly is

9
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,479
gonna be located you see here in the

10
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,829
dermal region of the skin so starting

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,109
with our sebaceous glands or oil glands

12
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,339
they occur over the entire body except

13
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,789
the palms and soles

14
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:32,700
they're simple Abiola glands and the

15
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,558
hollow crown secretions they basically

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,090
the entire cell will break up to form

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,039
the secretion we're going to see a

18
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,160
comparison between oil and sweat glands

19
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,049
later in this video these oil glands

20
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,209
secrete this oily substance called sebum

21
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:47,429
and are mostly associated with the hair

22
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,289
follicles we see here so here's our

23
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,600
sebum and associated with that hair

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,920
follicle again that image of the skin

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
comes back and hopefully it's starting

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,600
to make more sense with each video that

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,280
you watch so the sebaceous clear that

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,980
oil producing glands what does the sebum

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,099
actually do you could see it kind of it

30
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,618
here it's providing a lubrication to the

31
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,679
hair and also the surrounding skin it's

32
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:13,319
also softening both of these regions now

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,950
it is an oil so it's hydrophobic and it

34
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,899
also provides some waterproofing some

35
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,629
resistance to water of both the hair and

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,490
skin it's being secreted and covering

37
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:25,618
all this region it can also collect dirt

38
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:28,469
to help maintain cleanliness of the skin

39
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,540
and overall health of the individual for

40
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,129
example you see again located here is

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,590
our sebaceous gland here's our hair

42
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:37,920
follicle there just seem super releasing

43
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,140
to the surface of the skin now sweat

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,070
glands just to take a step here of sweat

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,500
glands so we're gonna do a little

46
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,419
comparison there's two main types they

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,399
occur over the entire skin surface

48
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,939
except nipples and parts of external

49
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:54,540
genitalia and they prevent overheating

50
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:56,339
they can produce a total up to 500 CCS

51
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,090
cubic centimeters can also think about

52
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,609
as milliliters to 12 liters of sweat per

53
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,700
day and that is gonna be mostly water

54
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:07,530
and they are could be activated or

55
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,860
produce these secretions

56
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,330
due to heat or also stress is another

57
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,430
way that these sweat glands can be

58
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,469
activated they're just an example of

59
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,560
when located here within the dermal

60
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:21,299
layer of the skin

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,180
now sweat glands are pseudo risk Lambs

62
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:26,010
the American or a cocoon glands most

63
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,140
abundant sweat gland they produce what

64
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:30,899
we call true sweat about 99 percent

65
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:34,048
water with some salts they contain some

66
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,060
traces of metabolic waste up to 2% urea

67
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:38,670
not really any more than that staying at

68
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,009
the 99 verse and they open through pores

69
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:42,929
and their role is thermal regulation so

70
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:45,840
that can cool the body they're widely

71
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,510
present in the skin the 500 can be

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,269
located in just a single square

73
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:53,219
centimeter on the body I see an image

74
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,709
here that secretion again this is

75
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,180
occurring through pores and you're going

76
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,579
to notice a comparison between the other

77
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,349
two how it's very different so American

78
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,209
here also epic rating the kind of

79
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:07,018
interchangeable terms these sweat glands

80
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:09,539
are being secreted in this case now

81
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,389
another type of sweat glands they apple

82
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,578
crying are the apex or top of the cell

83
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,219
breaks off so if you think of that had

84
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:19,319
an apex a peer into apex at top of the

85
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:21,810
cell contain organic molecules that

86
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,689
decompose over time resulting in this

87
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,090
odorous secretion so because the cells

88
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:28,949
breaking off we're putting this we have

89
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,590
a lot more than this water being kind of

90
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:34,139
released here ducts open into the hair

91
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,969
follicles absent before puberty this

92
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,519
occurs only after puberty do these

93
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:41,280
particular glands develop the president

94
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,250
in the armpit genitalia areas and they

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,378
release proteins lipids and form of

96
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,150
steroids and so because we're getting

97
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:49,798
proteins and lipids being released in

98
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,019
parts of the cell this is what's

99
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,759
reducing that odor it's a lot more than

100
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,870
just water with so little salt in it

101
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:59,698
this is actual portions of the cell the

102
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,289
last one here going back to oil glands

103
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,849
there's produced in these are so you may

104
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:05,848
add a little bit of a comparison between

105
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:08,098
all three of them hello crying the

106
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:09,929
entire cells break me down he's

107
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:11,698
releasing the sebum was in an oil

108
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,189
lipid-based remember that's hydrophobic

109
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,038
it's lubricating the skin and retards

110
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:19,889
bacterial growth both benefits to the

111
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:23,250
body and skin found on the face chest

112
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:26,310
and back regions so mature cell dies and

113
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,110
becomes a secretory product so how do

114
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,300
all these kind of three compare

115
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,759
well here's a nice summary slide showing

116
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,740
the secretion versus is helping pinched

117
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,598
off kind of that producing that odor and

118
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,478
here we have an entire cell basically

119
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:44,728
being broken down producing that sebum

120
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:47,459
which is that oily substance lastly for

121
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:51,478
comparison our sebaceous or oil glands

122
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:53,519
versus our a book written in our attic

123
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,188
Rhine glands well we have to look here

124
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,438
at our images so some are separated out

125
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:00,599
from the hair follicle and here's our

126
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,599
sweat gland located with the hair

127
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:05,418
follicle and again our oil gland also

128
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:08,668
associated with that hair follicle are

129
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:12,180
eco cryin glans or apocrine glands

130
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:14,250
located here one is independent the

131
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,250
zuzia Ukraine we see here in the blue

132
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,528
and our apocrine glands here are

133
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,329
associated with the hair follicle keep

134
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:24,028
in mind don't forget these sebaceous or

135
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:26,938
oil glands are also associated with the

136
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:28,740
hair follicle as we see here so again

137
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,099
what's inserted with the hair pockets it

138
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,900
out great for identification purposes

139
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:36,060
and can also help you remember where

140
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,239
they may or may not be found within the

141
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,240
body
