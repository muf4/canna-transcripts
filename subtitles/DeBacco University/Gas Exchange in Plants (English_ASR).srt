1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,259
here we're gonna focus on the gas

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,429
exchange that occurs in plants so well

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,080
there's a bunch of other things going on

4
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:09,480
here or specifically looking at the

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,879
carbon dioxide in the oxygen in this

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,589
case realize that those are used as part

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,780
of different reactions that are going on

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,890
within the plant there's water and

9
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,899
there's all these other kind of

10
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,399
molecules that are being either produced

11
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,229
or consumed but here we're focusing

12
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,768
simply on the exchange of carbon dioxide

13
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,778
and oxygen in plants so plants need to

14
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:29,909
breathe just like we do however unlike

15
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,640
us plants need to consume carbon dioxide

16
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,079
and they exhale oxygen they're taking in

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,179
carbon dioxide from the air and they're

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,410
releasing oxygen Wiis through our

19
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,869
breathing we do the opposite we're

20
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,959
consuming oxygen in producing carbon

21
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:45,449
dioxide now the importance of the carbon

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,850
cycle so we look up here seeing a little

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,670
bit of our kind of carbon dioxide within

24
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,558
a forest system but the same is true for

25
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,899
all plants the carbon dioxide

26
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,968
abbreviated co2 is taken in from the air

27
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,920
that's the clear here that is the carbon

28
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,570
dioxide taken from the air and is

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,250
assembled into sugar through the process

30
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,659
of photosynthesis which you see

31
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,959
occurring here we're taking in these

32
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:09,569
sun's light energy burning of plants you

33
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,118
see down here with these couple reds pop

34
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:15,029
up here and here well release carbon

35
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,920
oxide back into the atmosphere so the

36
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,590
yellow here is the sunlight the red

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,960
appears here here and here is fire or

38
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,670
respiration that's occurring this is the

39
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,329
carbon dioxide molecules the clear ones

40
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,030
green is just carbon which is stored in

41
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,590
the chunk of trees or plants and blue is

42
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,700
water again those are all coming

43
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,640
together right here for this

44
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,409
photosynthetic process now plants

45
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,079
regulate Carmex in water via the stomata

46
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,609
stomata are pores they're not holes in

47
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,739
leaves that allow the plant to take in

48
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,239
carbon dioxide which might say the

49
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,399
reports in that holes is there able to

50
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,109
be regulated it's just an opening and

51
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,549
closing right here so what they look

52
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,989
like on the leaf surface if you look

53
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,000
straight you kind of scan that leaf

54
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:55,769
surface with a microscope this is what

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,019
you may say it's a greater concentration

56
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:00,328
on the undersides of leaves in most

57
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:02,908
plants except not in lily pads because

58
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,259
of the water there so typically on the

59
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,359
underside of leaves its reopen the

60
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,890
stomata this is important because when

61
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,110
we're foliar spraying our plants and

62
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,300
looking to get nutrients and other

63
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,860
products inside the leaf these stomata

64
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,140
is one way where we can kind of

65
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,880
easily get something into the interior

66
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,709
portions of the leaf so plants also

67
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,689
regulate connects it in water via these

68
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,210
stomata however when the stomata are

69
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,740
open they let co2 in which is great but

70
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,140
at the same time they're also losing

71
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,939
water so they're in a continual balance

72
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:31,769
here taking in carbon dioxide and losing

73
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,289
that precious water they absorb through

74
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,390
the roots our plants are in this battle

75
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:37,739
of trying to regulate stomata to take in

76
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,779
carbon dioxide so they can boost the

77
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,450
sugars that they need but not lose too

78
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,849
much water and that's why I have the

79
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:46,439
seesaw here to kind of show that balance

80
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,469
of taking in one thing but losing

81
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,699
another lastly here of roots the roots

82
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,590
of the plant we can't figure out those

83
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,599
in gas exchange they respire just like

84
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,090
us so as a result they're consuming

85
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,829
oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide it's

86
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,390
important that roots have oxygen present

87
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,940
along with sufficient water and

88
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,829
nutrients this is why it is possible to

89
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,709
drown plants and by adding too much

90
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,380
water so as we just talked about these

91
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:13,020
roots taking in oxygen and also sugars

92
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:16,620
they will be releasing carbon oxide and

93
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,870
water in the stomata and the plant is

94
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,360
trying to take in corrected from the air

95
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,159
through the process of photosynthesis so

96
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,750
keep in mind we have to look at the what

97
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,489
the leaves are doing in the chloroplasts

98
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,590
and also what the roots are doing

99
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,930
because they're kind of both complete

100
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,370
this continual cycle here of gas

101
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,370
exchange in plants
