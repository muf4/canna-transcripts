1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,560
video

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,318
in this video lecture we're going to be

4
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,599
learning about identifying cannabis

5
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:08,960
point anatomy

6
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,800
some you might be familiar with like the

7
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
picture here of this nice

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
female bud but we're going to get into

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,960
some of the other details that you might

10
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:16,719
have seen before

11
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,160
but maybe not familiar with their actual

12
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,278
terminology

13
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,118
so first off if you want to learn a

14
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,960
little bit more i have this link to this

15
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,879
reference article here and cited here i

16
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,839
will use some aspects of it in this

17
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,599
presentation

18
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,759
but there's even more detail provided

19
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
there so first off i want to talk about

20
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,920
rooted cutting now rooted cuttings are

21
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,600
simple form of vegetative propagation

22
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,440
and we see the example here exhibit a

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,399
with the rooted cutting about two weeks

24
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,479
after rooting

25
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,480
and this bar represents 10 centimeters

26
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,679
for a size orientation

27
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,599
now other cuttings they don't all have

28
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,159
to look like this is an example here of

29
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,160
some other

30
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,439
rooted cuttings now these are vegetative

31
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,359
propagation meaning these are

32
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,599
what a lot of growers refer to as clones

33
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,920
these are genetic copies of the mother

34
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
or

35
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,198
stock plant going to carry on those same

36
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,198
terpene profiles

37
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,519
the same cannabinoids as the mother

38
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:04,478
plant it's a great way to ensure

39
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,359
genetic consistency then we also have

40
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,280
the internode

41
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,680
of the cannabis plant so there's a lot

42
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,359
of terms here we have

43
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,040
the the chute that kind of comes out to

44
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,879
the side it's called the axillary chute

45
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,880
we see that located right here

46
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,399
two bracks and there's kind of the areas

47
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,478
that kind of like little

48
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
that branch out and we have two solitary

49
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,159
flowers in this image we have a solitary

50
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,799
flower here on the right hand side

51
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,040
and another one here on the left this is

52
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,479
all located at the node here

53
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,759
where the axle leaf kind of comes in

54
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,759
here the kind of the

55
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,599
uh petiole of the leaf enters at the

56
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,000
node here and this would ultimately

57
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,959
kind of lead to one of the true or fan

58
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,478
leaves here

59
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,798
now in this image the bar represents

60
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,319
about two tenths of a centimeter

61
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,680
just to give you another orientation of

62
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,478
their picture showing the same general

63
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,880
area we can see

64
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,519
a lot of the same anatomy features

65
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,438
located

66
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,280
right here keep in mind the distance

67
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,359
between two nodes is called the inter

68
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,879
node space when the plant stretches

69
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,478
the spacing of the internodes increases

70
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,239
then we get to the cotyledons and these

71
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,078
are the embryonic or seed leaves which

72
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,399
are the first two leaves to appear

73
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,919
from a germinating seed they tend to be

74
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,598
more rounder in appearance you can see

75
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,159
them clearly evident here

76
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,919
uh and it's kind of a nice little way to

77
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,280
kind of see that little seedling come up

78
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,799
and that ceiling can kind of go through

79
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,919
and be those first leaves to start

80
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,200
capturing the sun

81
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,719
so you can start to go through the

82
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,799
photosynthetic process so it can start

83
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,800
growing exponentially

84
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
now after those cuddlings or seed leaves

85
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
go by we get into what called true

86
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,719
leaves

87
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,479
now true leaves as you see here's our

88
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,080
two seed these are cutaweens

89
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,318
these would be our first our next two

90
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,200
leaves is we are true leaves and tree

91
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,598
these are basically

92
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,799
any leaves of the seed plant other than

93
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,079
the catalines

94
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,680
so these second and

95
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,680
sorry these third and fourth leaves

96
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,200
right here and everything after that

97
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,319
would be considered true leaves

98
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,079
now when they get older they kind of

99
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,598
look like this and higher up in the

100
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,640
plant a lot of growers will refer them

101
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,479
as fan leaves

102
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,919
it's just a further classification of

103
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,840
true leaves

104
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,119
then we get into sugar leaves these

105
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,959
leaves kind of grow

106
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
out of the bud and have many trichomes

107
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,158
on them and it's the trichomes that give

108
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,280
the appearance of the sugar on the

109
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:08,959
leaves if you've kind of cooked

110
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,439
something you kept put powdered sugar on

111
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,280
it

112
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,800
kind of looks like that same appearance

113
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,318
this is why they get the term

114
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
sugar leaves is it looks like you kind

115
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,839
of took that powdered sugar and

116
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
lightly coated it what you're actually

117
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,120
looking at there is a series a

118
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,719
density of trichomes then we get male

119
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
and female pre-flowers

120
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,759
so the male flowers they produce the

121
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,799
pollen we can see those right here they

122
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,359
want to look for these kind of

123
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,159
pronounced

124
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
sac like flower structures in comparison

125
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,798
the female pre-flowers located right

126
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,080
below me here

127
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,920
these will ultimately produce the

128
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,719
cannabinoids and or seeds if they get

129
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,158
pollinated

130
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,560
you want to look for these fine little

131
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,079
wispy white hairs called the stigmas

132
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,439
now you want to hear the term stigma i

133
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,159
think of sticky stigma which might

134
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,560
always look like

135
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,000
even finer hairs on them is this

136
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,280
structure would be responsible for

137
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,360
capturing pollen

138
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,759
for the plant there'll be something

139
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,120
called popcorn buds now popcorn buds

140
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,438
get their names simply because they're

141
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,360
similar size to a popcorn kernel

142
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,799
these are b grade buds do the overall

143
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,560
size of those buds

144
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
and the potency will be similar though

145
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,438
slightly lower than a grade buds

146
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,239
produced on the same

147
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,438
plant they're often offered at a reduced

148
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,120
price if you're looking at purchasing

149
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,318
them due to their lack of visual impact

150
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,040
compared to those

151
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,079
large a-grade buds they're getting the

152
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,239
max amount of light

153
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,079
and have the maximum amount of terpenes

154
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,359
and cannabinoids in them

155
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,959
then we get to those trichomes that i

156
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,560
mentioned a little bit earlier it's kind

157
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,680
of a focus on them and they are hair

158
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,600
like out gross

159
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,280
that are the site of cannabinoid terpene

160
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,199
and flavonoid production

161
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,959
that kind of zoomed out look kind of see

162
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
how they get the term those sugar leaves

163
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,319
coated with those trichomes as you zoom

164
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
a little bit closer closer and closer

165
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,959
you can see they're kind of like clear

166
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,879
to whitish

167
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,839
mushroom-like structures and again this

168
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,000
is where you're going to find your

169
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,359
cannabinoids and terpenes and flavonoids

170
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,519
it's going to be kind of condensed in

171
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,520
the plant so they're going to store them

172
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,120
this is a calyx structure this is found

173
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,478
in all flowering plants

174
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,319
and it's the first part of the flower

175
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,478
that forms it's composed of a collection

176
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,360
of small leaves called sepals that form

177
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,038
near

178
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,639
where the flower meets the stem and we

179
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,560
can see that evident

180
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,079
right here provides stability of the

181
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,120
flower and creates protective structure

182
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,038
for the reproductive organs of the plant

183
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,399
then we go back to the stigma here kind

184
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,120
of looking a little bit more of a zoomed

185
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,279
in kind of

186
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,160
a stereoscope image of developing female

187
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,239
flowers

188
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,080
and we can see those stigmas here on a

189
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,439
premature stigma here just starting to

190
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,719
kind of develop and come out

191
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,719
here's a fully mature you can see it

192
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
much larger and even like small little

193
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
fine hairs

194
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,639
because remember it is again responsible

195
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,038
for capturing

196
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,759
the pollen a little more macroscopic

197
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,918
scale

198
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
we can see here kind of those stigmas

199
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,599
there that are produced again at high

200
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,879
concentrations and those female flowers

201
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,160
because they're going to be responsible

202
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,120
as the plants trying to do that to

203
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,199
increase the odds

204
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,399
that will intercept pollen floating in

205
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,160
the air

206
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,918
they have the early female pre-flowers

207
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
so we have this stipule here

208
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,079
that calyx that i mentioned earlier

209
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,038
again this image located right here then

210
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,199
we have the

211
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,038
pistol here and which includes the

212
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
stigma and then the stippy wolf right

213
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,399
here and this is a small leaf-like

214
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,319
appendage of a leaf typically born in

215
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,239
pairs at the base of a leaf

216
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,160
stock so again might be something you

217
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,639
see in pairs again looking at that node

218
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,800
region of a particular plant

219
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,639
then the apical portion of the main

220
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,400
shoot the apical part of the shoot here

221
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,439
is five days after transition to a short

222
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,198
photo period

223
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,800
and we see that here in the can this bar

224
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,400
represents half a centimeter

225
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,319
this apical area this shortly after

226
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,599
photoperiod is going to induce flowering

227
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,840
and we can see here

228
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,680
that this plant is female because we

229
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,318
notice the induction of

230
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,240
female flowers being produced and then

231
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,080
lastly we have the shoe apex and this is

232
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,160
kind of image d and e here they're about

233
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,839
11 to 12 days of growth under short

234
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,720
photo period inducing that flowering in

235
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,119
the plant

236
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
and that apex phase determined by the

237
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,399
first day of visible inflorescence at

238
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
first they have a visible flower

239
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,560
these bars represent half a centimeter

240
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,079
and looking here again that apex that

241
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,639
region here particularly that top of the

242
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,079
plant

243
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
is going to where a lot of cell division

244
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,598
occurs it's a meristematic

245
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,120
region and it's going to be our site of

246
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,800
that flower production

247
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,240
so hopefully this provides with some

248
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,120
details about

249
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,120
general cannabis anatomy of the plant
