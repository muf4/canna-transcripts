1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,200
in this tobacco university video do a

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,169
fluorescent light comparison

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,859
directed towards cannabis production

00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:10,859

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,079
so if you're in the market for a

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,919
fluorescent light you might want to

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,038
consider some of the options presented

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,400
here

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,400
now a disclaimer is that i've not

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,159
received any financial compensation for

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,759
writing the following product review

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,920
i have no material connection to the

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,480
brands products or services that i have

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,920
mentioned

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,880
here so as a standard for comparison to

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,640
set kind of

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,000
an equal comparison all the falling

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,160
lights are t5s

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,039
or four feet long and are eight bulb

20
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,799
design

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,600
for each light i'll provide you the good

22
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,599
the bad and my general recommendations

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,920
so starting with the first one here the

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,640
sun blaze it has a five year warranty

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,960
uh it only runs on 120 volt power which

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,759
might be limiting for larger areas

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,039
and average light at an average price so

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,079
kind of that good kind of like

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,120
middle ground light the sun blaze then

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,040
we get into the quantum

31
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,798
bad boy light and the good is that the

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,960
ballast drives more wattage it has

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
large reflectors however it is the most

34
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,239
expensive option

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,920
and the price performance may be

36
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,879
justifiable when you're looking at that

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,400
comparison

38
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,719
it is directed a little bit more to the

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,920
commercial market so it is kind of comes

40
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,879
in the voltage of potentially 120 or 240

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,879
and kind of a nice general light here

42
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,319
then we have the agrobrite which is a

43
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,560
also has a five year warranty it

44
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,879
includes these 6400

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,400
kelvin bulbs so now this high power some

46
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,640
of the top and lights and it

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
seems to be an above average light at an

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,400
attractive price

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,600
so again another one worth comparing

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,399
there

51
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,239
now if i was to only select one i would

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,159
select the quantum bad boys

53
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,000
so while fluorescence may have limited

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,359
applications for cannabis production

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,879
but if you're looking for an early

56
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,118
propagation light this may fit the

57
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,280
particular stage of the grow cycle

58
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,879
i've talked with some growers that do

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,079
have these they do seem to really like

60
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,239
them they seem to last

61
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,839
they seem to be improvement of over

62
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,078
other lights that they were using

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
so this is why if i was to select one

64
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,280
out of the ones mentioned

65
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,360
this is the one i would select so just

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,239
simply use this as a comparison as you

67
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,239
shop for the light

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,239
as a best fit for your situation
