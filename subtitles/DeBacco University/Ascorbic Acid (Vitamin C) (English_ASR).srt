1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
you may associate ascorbic acid with

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:06,778
vitamin C being and oranges and other

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,609
citrus crafts and you are correct but

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:11,370
here were a look at its impact as a

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:13,558
plant hormone and what effects that can

6
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:16,230
happen plants more than just the citrus

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,299
such as the oranges and lemons so this

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,789
vitamin C is abundant component of

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,399
plants its proposed functions in post

10
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,410
synthesis as an enzyme cofactor this

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,108
also includes a synthesis of ethylene

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,589
gibberellins and anthocyanins and also

13
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,210
in the control of cell growth so it can

14
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,399
have more than just the post synthetic

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,539
process it can also control and regulate

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,030
potentially cell growth in plants L

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,939
absorb acids is just referring as lv 4

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,640
into the type of shape that it has we're

19
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:50,070
looking at L and D forms L is more

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,530
biologically active this is the form of

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,020
vitamin C so it's essential for plants

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,289
as it is to animals is this something

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,850
that crosses both plants and animals

24
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:01,920
vitamin C here regulates cell division

25
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,320
do you can see here growth and it's

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,129
involved in signal transduction it's the

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,079
passing of signals within a plant or

28
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:11,579
within a cell in general in contrast to

29
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,099
the single pathway responsible for

30
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,978
absorbing acid both synthesis in animals

31
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:19,289
in contrast to that plants use multiple

32
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,810
pathways to synthesize this particular

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,520
plant hormone this perhaps reflects the

34
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,189
importance of this molecule on plant

35
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,929
health because as multiple pathways okay

36
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:30,599
something was to happen to one plant

37
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,939
almost need a way to kind of produce

38
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,609
this particular plant hormone at

39
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,019
absorbing acid as a result they have

40
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:40,170
multiple pathways to be to accomplish

41
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,298
that so our C acids not only important

42
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,659
antioxidant also appears to link to

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,490
flowering time developmental senescence

44
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,009
which is the degradation of plants

45
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:52,379
leaves here for example they senesce

46
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,989
they die off like the leaves in a New

47
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,149
England fall program cell death which is

48
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,978
apoptosis in response to pathogens

49
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,960
through complex signal transduction

50
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,179
Network so what I try to show a little

51
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,218
bit here is this complex network is just

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,129
an example of how you can have one input

53
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:10,258
finding a whole cascade of events to

54
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,539
occur ultimate leading to gene

55
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,318
regulation there's just some of the

56
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:18,209
examples

57
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:20,039
sorbic acid can do lastly therefore it's

58
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,069
assumed that absolute acid affects

59
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,199
phytochrome mediated signaling just

60
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:28,889
process during the transition from the

61
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,419
vegetative to the reproductive phase in

62
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:32,548
the final stage of development and

63
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,530
ultimately senescence so when you're

64
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:36,659
flipping your plants going from our

65
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,579
flowering going from a vegetative to

66
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:41,188
that flowering stage during that flower

67
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:43,170
development absorbing acid could be

68
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:45,719
occurring in higher amounts and

69
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:49,018
influencing that so again I'm just an

70
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,359
example how a plant hormone well may be

71
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,200
needed in small amounts in the plant can

72
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:56,340
have large effects on that whole plant

73
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:59,388
physiology and ultimately potentially

74
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,389
even the anatomy
