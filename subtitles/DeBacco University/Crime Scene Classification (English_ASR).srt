1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,278
so in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,679
we're going to be looking at crime scene

3
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:07,919
classification

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,959
and a couple examples as well as how we

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,599
would classify

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,040
certain crimes given some information so

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,320
first off we want to think about what

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,160
types of crimes are there whether it's

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,000
homicides burglary sexual assault and

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,839
there's drug offenses

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,359
and there's many more these are just a

12
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,518
couple examples

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,199
we can see here a list of types of crime

14
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,959
the frequency and percentage that they

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,359
occur so some definitely

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,640
more common such as burglary definitely

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,719
much more common

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,000
than some of the other ones listed here

19
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,359
but still we have to take all these

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,799
into consideration and know how to

21
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,320
handle these we're not sure what crime

22
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,439
scene we're going to be coming up

23
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,359
to when we're doing an investigation

24
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,119
so also looking at crime scenes we're

25
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,000
also looking at how age could play a

26
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,519
factor

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,439
some crimes simply are more likely to be

28
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,920
committed by certain age groups

29
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,799
so this is where it doesn't give us an

30
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,960
idea of

31
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,159
you know what individual committed what

32
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
crime but it can

33
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,558
increase the odds of when we identify an

34
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,878
individual or identify a crime

35
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,878
what age group might we be looking at as

36
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,478
far as increased odds based on the

37
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
information here in the data

38
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,640
to look at who we might be looking for a

39
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,640
potential suspect

40
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,840
then we have our physical locations so

41
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,280
keep in mind that we have

42
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
indoor locations we have outdoor

43
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
locations we can have car or vehicle

44
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,280
locations so all these

45
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,118
have their own challenges so we must

46
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,478
take these all into consideration be

47
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,079
able to handle any of these because

48
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,359
sometimes we even have

49
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,840
multiple physical locations involved

50
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,280
now a victim's location specifically

51
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,159
well we're looking at a primary crime

52
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,400
scene because this is

53
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,280
the original location of the crime but

54
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,040
they mentioned they could also be

55
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,079
secondary crime scenes and this is kind

56
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,240
of an alternate location

57
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,078
where additional evidence may be found a

58
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,158
body could have been murdered at one

59
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,158
place and transported to another

60
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,159
so keep in mind that just because we're

61
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,320
observing one particular crime scene

62
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
we might be thinking about the potential

63
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,438
for there to be another crime

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
scene that may also need to be

65
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,438
investigated

66
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,359
we can look at the size of the scene in

67
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,559
general so keep in mind that there can

68
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,519
be everything from

69
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,399
the macroscopic down to the microscopic

70
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,799
so

71
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,318
a macroscopic scene contains many

72
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
microscopic scenes within it

73
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,839
the macroscopic is basically where the

74
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,200
body is found in the field a gunshot to

75
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,239
a victim something we can see very

76
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,919
easily

77
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,400
microscopic has traced evidence such as

78
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,799
a gunshot residue trier treadmarks

79
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,319
or the whole host of trace evidence that

80
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
we could be looking at

81
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,238
investigating so keep in mind that we

82
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,159
want to be mindful and

83
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,000
of the large scale items but also don't

84
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,039
forget about the small scale items as

85
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,120
well

86
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,079
now when we're classifying a scene so

87
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,159
here's just a

88
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
one example where thieves break into a

89
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,840
jewelry store jewelry is taken the

90
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
suspect gets in a getaway car

91
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,400
and the stolen goods are taken to their

92
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,159
apartment again how would you classify

93
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
this scene this is kind of like example

94
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,759
a so if you want to think about this

95
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,840
pause the video here and

96
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,799
think about this the answer will be

97
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,158
revealed on the next slide

98
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,599
so looking at the scene how do we

99
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,719
classify it well with the information

100
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,399
presented here

101
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,318
we'd be looking at be a robbery it'd be

102
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,120
the type of crime it'd be located

103
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:06,878
indoors

104
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,560
primary scene would be the julius door

105
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,199
but we also have the secondary

106
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,400
scene of the themes getaway car and also

107
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,598
their apartment

108
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,000
so again this is just how we would

109
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,799
classify the example of that scene

110
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
provided there

111
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,120
as exhibit a for exhibit

112
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,840
b here looking at this scenario a man

113
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,680
was strangled

114
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,439
in his home the perpetrators used the

115
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,239
man's fan to transport the body and dump

116
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,919
it in a nearby

117
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,400
lake how do we go about the

118
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,439
classification of this scene as exhibit

119
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,599
b

120
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,680
pause the video here before i reveal the

121
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,759
answers

122
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,040
so looking here at our exhibit b how do

123
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,318
we classify this scene well with the

124
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,400
information presented

125
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,000
here's what we'd be looking at the type

126
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
of crime would be a homicide

127
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,199
the physical location or locations would

128
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
be both indoors and

129
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,359
outdoors the primaries seem to be the

130
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,840
indoor the home of the victim who is

131
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,640
stabbed or shot by the offender and is

132
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,878
in this case

133
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,318
strangled our secondary scene the

134
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,079
outdoors since this would involve the

135
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,679
van and the point at the lake where the

136
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,599
victim was dumped it would be considered

137
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
a secondary crime scene

138
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,280
so this just gives a brief example of

139
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,080
how we'd be comparing

140
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,479
and classifying two different examples

141
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,599
of

142
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,598
crime scenes
