1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,599
if you're growing cannabis plants

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,480
indoors and want to know how to properly

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:16,160
flush them

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:17,679
this debaco university video is for you

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,519
all right let's look at flushing indoor

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,358
grown cannabis plants

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,920
so first off i want you to realize that

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
this there is not a standardized method

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,279
no studies have been published to date

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,240
to examine the exact process of flushing

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,839
cannabis plants

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,439
this is why you're probably hearing

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,920
searching for this video because there's

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,238
a lot of

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,760
variability however this does not mean

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,878
that it's not common practice

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:42,079
as the idea to produce high quality bud

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,399
is also to minimize the inputs

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,840
one of the greatest quality bud with the

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,960
minimal amount of inputs

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,120
to again maximize the efficiency so the

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,198
goal of any flushing protocol

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,198
is to reduce nutrient concentrations in

24
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,878
the root zone so the plant metabolizes

25
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,599
what is already present in the plant

26
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:59,599
tissue

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,359
so why we typically over water plants as

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,679
part of flushing to kind of flush out

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,799
those excess salts as excess nutrients

30
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,879
with adding just

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,479
pure water to the root zone of the

32
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,560
cannabis plants

33
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,000
so what water properties are we looking

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,840
for well ideally

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,599
water should be around room temperature

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,560
70 75 degrees fahrenheit

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,839
and have slightly acidic ph value of 6.0

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,478
to 6.3

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,000
to aid in the ability to ensure

40
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,719
nutrients are soluble and

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,920
easily removed from the water meaning if

42
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,719
you have cold water

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,920
and the ph is off that could affect the

44
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,920
effectiveness

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
of the ability to flush out those

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,478
nutrients they can impact that

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
ability for that kind of flushing or the

48
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,118
goal here of the flushing of those

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
nutrients out

50
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,040
which is an important consideration so

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,159
for the first nutrient to go if you're

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,359
flushing what's going to be the first

53
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,280
nutrient you're going to lose well

54
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,519
nitrogen is the most water soluble of

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,439
the nutrients so watch for a potential

56
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,239
deficiency of this nutrient first in the

57
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,000
plant

58
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,399
this is characterized by the yellowing

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
of lower leaves while the upper portions

60
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
of the plant remain green

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
at least for a period of time if you

62
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,118
start to see this

63
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,520
yellow coloration you might be flushing

64
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,758
too early into aggressively because

65
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,799
the plant is visually showing you it's

66
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,559
running out of

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
nutrients particularly nitrogen in this

68
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,759
case this might be a sign make note look

69
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,119
back at your records you might be

70
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,039
flushing a little too early or with a

71
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,680
little bit too much water

72
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,439
now the timing is very important when

73
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,040
you're looking at this flushing process

74
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,479
the goal is to time the reduction in

75
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,359
nutrients with the harvesting of the

76
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,039
buds

77
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
when the plant runs out of nutrients

78
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,159
this should be very close to harvesting

79
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
so there's no plant stunting

80
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,519
or any chance of a potential yield

81
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,039
reduction

82
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,959
this is best done if you're going to be

83
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,639
harvesting the entire plant and not

84
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,400
doing a selective bud harvest

85
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,719
as this may result in the second harvest

86
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,480
being negatively impacted

87
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,400
by the reduction in plant available

88
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,000
nutrients so just as the picture shows

89
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,800
here timing is very important

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,479
you want to be have a comfortable idea

91
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
of when you'll be harvesting your plants

92
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,919
so you can plan your no nutrient adding

93
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
your flushing

94
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,518
accordingly now indoor substrate

95
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
categories

96
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,920
so keep in mind just because you're

97
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,840
growing indoors doesn't mean everyone

98
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,439
follows the exact same protocol

99
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,878
hydroponics require the least amount of

100
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,680
time between stopping nutrients and

101
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,079
harvest

102
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
where substrate based indoor grows the

103
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,080
exact type used

104
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,360
can impact the timing now if you're in a

105
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,560
pure hydroponic

106
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,640
situation here if a type of essentially

107
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,439
substrate-free system being used

108
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,199
such as aeroponics or deep water culture

109
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,239
the roots will immediately lose access

110
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,479
to nutrients

111
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,599
once you add in only plain water to

112
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,119
their reservoir

113
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,639
so as a result you should only be

114
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,319
running plants with no nutrients for

115
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,518
about a three to four day flush period

116
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,079
if you're doing one of these

117
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,439
growing situations otherwise the risk of

118
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,799
nutrient deficiencies

119
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,400
will definitely increase now

120
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,519
looking at hydroponics substrate-based

121
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,879
flushing this gets a little bit more

122
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,200
complicated because there's

123
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,560
many different substrate options when

124
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,759
plants are grown in the substrate though

125
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
there will be some retention of

126
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,719
nutrients

127
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,759
but this will be impart substrate

128
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,199
dependent

129
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,639
for example if you're growing in clay

130
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,878
pebbles or other material that require

131
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,559
near continual irrigation

132
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,079
the three to four day recommendation for

133
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,318
the hydroponic environment

134
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,599
can be followed meaning once you

135
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:10,238
determine i'm going to harvest my buds

136
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,399
in about

137
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,519
three to four days then you can stop

138
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,280
adding any nutrients

139
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,519
and just only add water to the plants at

140
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,358
that point however if you're growing in

141
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,199
a peat moss or cocoa based substrate the

142
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,198
duration of time of flushing

143
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,400
can be increased to four to seven days

144
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
almost a week from

145
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,359
your plant harvest if you're using

146
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
soilless mix this can get more

147
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,759
complicated

148
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,519
because of the variability of components

149
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,360
that exist in this category

150
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,959
however in general this can be the

151
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,240
longest interval should be about

152
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:40,159
5 to 10 days of period note that also

153
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
based on how aggressively you are fed

154
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,280
during the

155
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,039
flowering cycle the end of that

156
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,959
flowering phase will also impact the

157
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,360
concentrations in substrate

158
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,478
will likely be if you're a very heavy

159
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,439
nutrient feeder you're going to have

160
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,599
more nutrients

161
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,120
in that substrate potentially than if

162
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,240
you were fertilizing a little bit more

163
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,120
on the lighter scale

164
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,038
so take that also into consideration

165
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,519
what are the basics flushing protocol

166
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,879
well in a pure hydroponic setup simple

167
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,799
change the water with new water that

168
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,600
does not contain any nutrients but is ph

169
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,840
appropriate

170
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,759
fairly easy in that regards however

171
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,758
you're looking at a hydroponic substrate

172
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,000
then you irrigate as you normally would

173
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,680
only with water no nutrients added

174
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,199
which should be until the water comes

175
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,360
out of the container

176
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,800
now this water leaving the root zone

177
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
should be tested for ec

178
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,400
electrical connectivity parts per

179
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,800
million the goal is to

180
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,839
increase the duration of irrigation

181
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,478
until the readings

182
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,079
are reduced to near plane water levels

183
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,839
so you know the water going in you water

184
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,199
the plant you get the water coming out

185
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,959
you test that if you're getting a very

186
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,800
high reading initially

187
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,959
keep watering keep watering until that

188
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,360
reading starts to become decreased

189
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,439
this will ensure the root zone has been

190
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
properly and significantly flushed

191
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,319
so that's the basic flushing protocol

192
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,758
everyone wants to know how much water

193
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,680
should i add per container

194
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,520
but really having these meters being

195
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
able to dial it in for your particular

196
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,439
setup is how you're going to ensure

197
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,799
you're getting that proper flushing of

198
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,800
that root zone
