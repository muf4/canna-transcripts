1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,839
so on this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,480
going to go over the flying or bloom

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,480
phase

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,080
of the cannabis growth cycle and show

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,638
you a little bit of some images

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,839
so you get an idea of the duration of

7
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:17,919
flowering phase

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,920
related to cannabis

9
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:22,719
[Music]

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,759
all right let's go over the flowering or

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,000
bloom phase of cannabis growth cycle

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,599
so first off the flowering stage length

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
well the flowering stage is the final

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,599
growth

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,079
stage of the cannabis plant and is when

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,920
the buds are produced and maturing

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,520
this is typically in weeks eight to

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,359
eleven of the growth cycle

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,359
most drains flower in eight to nine

20
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,200
weeks of the growth phase to give an

21
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,878
idea some can take even longer

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
particularly those that are sativa

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,159
dominant strains everyone wonders like

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,840
when is their

25
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,679
in flower what week and flower are they

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,480
in this kind of offers

27
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,600
a good visual guide as far as the

28
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,919
flowering phase which is

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
initially week one two weeks in the

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,800
flower three

31
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,238
four five six seven and eight and we can

32
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,759
see how that progression does

33
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,280
change as far as weeks into flower

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,040
now this may depend a little bit on the

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,840
variety you might be growing but at

36
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,000
least this provides a general kind of

37
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,118
overview of the stage of flower your

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,879
plants might be in

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,879
particular determine when those early

40
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,719
weeks are occurring

41
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,000
now flowering stage for outdoor and

42
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,599
indoor production well

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,118
outdoor plants will initiate flowering

44
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,118
naturally when the plant receives 12

45
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,920
hours of light or less each day

46
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,879
which occurs in summer transition into

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,400
fall

48
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,478
indoor growers can trigger the flowering

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,439
cycle by reducing the photo period to 12

50
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,959
hours a day

51
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,438
so they have a little bit more control

52
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,798
and better timing of when that exactly

53
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,959
occurs

54
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,960
now the flowering kind of subphases kind

55
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,519
of like the stages of fetal development

56
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,679
here

57
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,118
flowering initiation is at one to three

58
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,560
weeks and that's the plants continue to

59
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,159
grow in physical size

60
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,840
pre-female flowers produce the pistols

61
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,040
which are the thin little white cat like

62
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,560
whisker hairs

63
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,920
then we get into the mid-flowering phase

64
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,640
which is approximately weeks four to

65
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,239
five

66
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,079
and the plant vegetatively will kind of

67
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,078
stop or at least slow and growing as the

68
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,959
plant focuses more on the bud

69
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,398
development

70
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,000
then we get into late flowering or

71
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,239
ripening which is basically week

72
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,038
six and beyond and this is trichome

73
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,878
density will

74
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,958
be noticeably increased color of the

75
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,399
pistils will also change

76
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,560
so this gives you again another

77
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,920
indication of are you in initiation of

78
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
flowering mid flowering or late

79
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,479
flowering phase of your plants

80
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,480
now grower tips during the flowering

81
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,039
phase so do not prune the plants during

82
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,719
this phase

83
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,079
plants should be trellised to support

84
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,759
heavy bud production

85
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,519
and you can see here excessive outdoor

86
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,959
production trellis thing doesn't have to

87
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,560
be super fancy you're just looking at a

88
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,360
way of plant support

89
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,878
growers will typically feed bloom

90
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,480
fertilizer to plants that have high

91
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,159
concentrations of phosphorus

92
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,000
but consider the substrate and be

93
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,400
careful how much you add

94
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
to avoid negative environmental effects

95
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,560
and limited

96
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,280
positive effects to the plant there yes

97
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
phosphorus

98
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,400
is needed but i find a lot of growers

99
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,079
are over applying it to the plants

100
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
at the end of the flowering phase we

101
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,680
have the flower buds will be

102
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,280
visually developed quickly towards the

103
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,959
end of the flowering phase

104
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,318
and we'll go about how to kind of go

105
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,360
through and look at all the wonderful

106
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,639
little trichomes

107
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,319
densities getting a magnifying loop

108
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,919
would be great to inspect these

109
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,518
so you could go through and determine

110
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,000
the peak ripeness

111
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,599
of your particular flowers but a lot of

112
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,598
it has to do with the setting up those

113
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,439
plants during the vegetative phase

114
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,598
recognizing the stages of development in

115
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,318
the flowering phase so you can ideally

116
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,199
have

117
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,839
a good harvest dry and cure phase as

118
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,839
well
