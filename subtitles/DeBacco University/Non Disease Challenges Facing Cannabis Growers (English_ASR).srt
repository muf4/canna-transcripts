1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
often when growing cannabis you can feel

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,740
like pushing the stone up a hill it can

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,900
be quite the battle us in particular

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,839
non-disease challenges facing cannabis

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,210
growers can be an area that trips a lot

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,679
of people up so I'm going to cover some

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,810
of those here so hopefully you can

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:22,230
identify it won't be a major problem for

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:24,538
you so looking at some of the challenges

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,350
here girls often think a plant does not

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,118
look normal

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,609
it is disease they immediately go to the

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,230
disease aspect but really it could be

14
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,420
something that's not disease oriented

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,420
being able to identify that early is

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,969
beneficial well the disease can often be

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,859
the case non disease issues that's

18
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,170
causing the problem even though it may

19
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,820
appear to be a disease so it's kind of

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,109
like figuring out a chess game here

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,878
where there's always a different

22
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:49,710
challenge something being presented it

23
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,329
can be either kind of looks by that look

24
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,429
through that and identify it properly

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,489
whether it is disease or something that

26
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:59,159
is not disease related they don't

27
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,750
realize your power as a grower in what

28
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,179
conditions you have control over and

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,530
what you do not have control over with

30
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,180
Inter operations there's very few

31
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,368
conditions of our does not have control

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,000
over however you need to recognize what

33
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:13,200
conditions you deem ideal and how you're

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,150
going to meet those and how you going to

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,460
monitor those targets if you're growing

36
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,210
outdoors you have a lot less control so

37
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,250
it can be a little bit more of a

38
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,599
challenge indoors you can see the

39
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,540
picture of the cat and the lion in the

40
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,819
shadow a lot more control but you got to

41
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,250
know what you want your growing area to

42
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,069
be and hanging a monitor and meet those

43
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,019
goals so knowing those targets is kind

44
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,339
of the first thing now what areas can

45
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,589
you control what areas should you be

46
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,450
targeting well in no particular order

47
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,000
what temperature you're gonna run the

48
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,810
room at what humidity level do you want

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,099
to be the air circulation the irrigation

50
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,409
nutrients use and throughout the growth

51
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,658
cycle and carbon dioxide concentration

52
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,640
all these things come together to make a

53
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,259
successful grow room any one of these

54
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,618
gets way out of control it can

55
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,259
significantly reduce yields and cause

56
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,989
the others to be of less importance so

57
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,090
you're only as strong as your weakest

58
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:09,030
target condition here in the environment

59
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,920
temperature again and these humidity can

60
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,750
vary depending on the growth stage so be

61
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,619
mindful of that so just know what your

62
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,500
targets are

63
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,030
the clear stage of claim that you have

64
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,848
you wanna have a check system so alarms

65
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,049
are alerts great and you also yourself

66
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:23,579
want to check the place at a consistent

67
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,500
time so you know if something is off

68
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,849
either checking it right after a pump

69
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,039
comes on right after a pump comes off

70
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:30,959
after a light comes on our light should

71
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,179
go off is just a good way to kind of

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,469
have that kind of is everything okay or

73
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,349
should there be something I should be

74
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:38,639
concerned about having alarms or alerts

75
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:40,768
of temperatures get too high or too low

76
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,098
is another way you can kind of add that

77
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,209
24-hour monitoring another things should

78
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,939
be able to know when something is

79
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:51,000
abnormal as a result you know what the

80
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:53,310
normal should be it'll be easy they'll

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,378
be easy for you to identify the abnormal

82
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,420
now in this case here we see the cameras

83
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:59,969
plants of you know not quite green color

84
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,309
it could be that the cultivar so that's

85
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:03,719
not to say a bad thing or if we're

86
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,789
supposed to have that green plant we see

87
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,469
these clovers here well this one kind of

88
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:09,628
looks a little off-color so this would

89
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,729
kind of be an abnormal one so by knowing

90
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:12,959
the normal knowing what should expect we

91
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:16,348
can tell whether we have something

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,689
pushing on various extremes from that

93
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:20,459
normal either really to dark green or to

94
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,680
light green or what color should we

95
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,939
expect so just having that idea as a

96
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,409
grower so you can identify something as

97
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,818
abnormal and the sooner you can identify

98
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:33,318
it the quicker you can go about

99
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,318
correcting that potential issue
