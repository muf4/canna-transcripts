00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,240
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,839
where we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,089
fluorescent lighting options for

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:15,360
cannabis production

5
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:17,278
[Music]

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,640
if you've been considering fluorescent

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,239
lights let's get into some of the

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,439
details so you can make an informed

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,239
decision

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,759
so the best use for fluorescent lights

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,118
fluorescent grow lights are best known

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,640
for their propagation abilities

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,559
especially when it comes to cannabis

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,839
simply due to their overall low light

15
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,439
intensities

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,600
they can be used for the full growth

17
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,159
cycle on low light demanding crops like

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,559
lettuce

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,159
but is not advised for cannabis they're

20
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,919
commonly used for the clones

21
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,000
seedling and young plant stages of

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,879
cannabis production so you can see here

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,119
of them over the easy clone now they're

24
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,640
best utilized when plants are small

25
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,399
so fluorescent tubes can cover the

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,160
specific area of the young plants

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,600
this will cut down on the square footage

28
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,599
space and can help growers

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
maximize their propagation space and

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
potentially save money

31
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,839
on electrical costs these lights can

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,600
also emit a full spectrum or favor blue

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,840
or potentially red wavelengths to help

34
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,679
control the height of the plants as well

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,520
blue color favoring will help keep the

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,840
plants small and compact

37
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,438
by making sure the internodes are as

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,880
tight as possible

39
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,039
red light will have a tendency to have

40
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,959
them stretch we see that here just a

41
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,640
quick little example

42
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,000
now using fluorescent lights so when

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,239
we're going through and using them the

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,400
grow lights have low heat output and low

45
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,560
light intensities when compared to cmh

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
ceramic metal halides hps high pressure

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,000
sodiums and led

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
light emitting diode options the

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,200
distance between lights and plants will

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
vary based on the exact type of

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
fluorescent that is selected

52
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,840
but for a good starting point is to

53
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,000
leave them about 6

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,759
inches or 15 centimeters away from the

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,359
plants the light should be

56
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,799
on adjustable hangers so that the

57
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,879
distance can be maintained

58
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
or adjusted as the plants grow as the

59
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,519
plants grow you want to maintain that

60
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,199
same distance

61
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,118
having a large face will cause plants to

62
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,399
stretch and become light deprived

63
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,640
so that's why you want those lights to

64
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,239
be as close as possible without causing

65
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,000
any negative effects such as plant

66
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,000
burning

67
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,118
now how many hours should you be running

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
the fluorescent lights

69
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,239
well since these should only be used

70
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,640
during the vegetative growth

71
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,159
the photo period should be kept 16 most

72
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,878
growers for 18 hours

73
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,479
plus however due to poor light

74
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,719
intensities growers should be running

75
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,679
these lights 20 to 24 hours to keep the

76
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,439
dli

77
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,360
as high as possible especially for

78
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,000
canvas which is a high light tolerant

79
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,319
plant

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
so simply because they produce such low

81
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,439
intensity light

82
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,560
running them for longer will allow the

83
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,280
accumulation

84
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
of energy over the total day to be a

85
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
little bit greater so this is where

86
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,239
growers may want to choose to run their

87
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,479
lights 20 or 20 even 24 hours

88
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,439
on the day there's two types of

89
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,119
fluorescent light

90
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,400
options the they are the t5 grow lights

91
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,360
and the compact fluorescent light or

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,159
cfls

93
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,440
for plant production t5s are the option

94
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,840
that should be considered

95
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,519
t5 lights offer many advantages over the

96
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
cfls in the sense that they're easier to

97
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,640
set up

98
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,519
more efficient operation the bulbs last

99
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,679
longer

100
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,800
but also be sure as a grower that you're

101
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,879
using also a t5 ballast is being used

102
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,719
and there are certain manufacturers i'll

103
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,158
cover that in a separate video

104
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,919
but certain manufacturers you might want

105
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,560
to look at or consider but if you're

106
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,598
going the

107
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,878
fluorescent light option you want to be

108
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,399
for plant production you want to make

109
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,280
sure you're looking specifically at

110
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,800
comparison

111
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,800
of t5 lights
