1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,480
if you're considering using rain tubing

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,640
for carbon dioxide delivery

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,320
here at tobacco university we're going

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,240
to go over some of the details

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:17,920
of this method if you're looking at

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,920
enriching an area with carbon dioxide

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,560
all right let's get into using rain

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,439
tubing for carbon dioxide delivery

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,160
for cannabis production well first off

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,278
what is

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,200
rain tubing and ray tubing is simple

12
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,000
tubing that has small pinholes at a

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,239
consistent consistent distance apart

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
it's commonly hung on light fixtures to

15
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,839
allow the carbon dioxide

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
to rain down on the plants and that's

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,520
where it gets its name

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,120
you'll notice here there's an example of

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,960
just small little pinholes

20
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,599
again they are small but they're evenly

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,280
distributed to allow that kind of even

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,359
delivery of carbon dioxide throughout

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,079
the entire growing area

24
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,479
so what's the setup of this rain tubing

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,558
well

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,839
brain tubing should be placed in a loop

27
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,798
and put in

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,439
attached to the regulator with a t

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,200
fitting

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,599
so you want to make sure as our image

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,000
shows here we're using in this example

32
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,759
a bottled carbon dioxide system we have

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,319
carbon x8 coming out going to a t

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,640
fitting

35
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,359
going to the loop here containing all of

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,400
the rain

37
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,200
tubing the goal is to feed the loop from

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
the bottle

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
both on both ends here that's why i use

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,439
a t fitting because this will help

41
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,759
ensure an

42
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,039
even and consistent distribution of the

43
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,280
carbon dioxide

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,000
now this can be for a small 25 foot

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,719
section or this can also be utilized for

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,438
a hundred

47
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,200
feet of rain tubing the same concept

48
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,359
does apply

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,399
now what height should i be mounting my

50
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,078
rain tubing at

51
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,519
well keep in mind that carbon dioxide is

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,279
heavier than air so it will naturally

53
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,039
want to sink in the grow space

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,799
as a result most growers will mount the

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
tubing above the plants

56
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,000
however growers need to take into

57
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,639
consideration their specific

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,599
growing space meaning where is your

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,280
exhaust system

60
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,359
where is your sensor going to be placed

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,960
and how tall will your plants get

62
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,799
these can play into different factors

63
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,000
when you're looking at how best to mount

64
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,800
your ring tubing

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,919
again should be relatively high in the

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
plant canopy

67
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,439
sensor should be placed usually just a

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,159
little bit above that and how tall your

69
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,359
plants will get

70
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,639
they're going to get really tall you

71
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,239
might want to have a system where you

72
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,598
can adjust this during the growing

73
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,159
season

74
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,919
so general recommendations is that when

75
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,159
using a grow tent as an example as we

76
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,559
see

77
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,318
here put the rain tubing along the

78
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,080
interior perimeter about one half to two

79
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,238
thirds of the way up the plant

80
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
on three walls dipping down in front to

81
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,519
allow easy

82
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
access is preferred so in this example

83
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,159
here you can see i put the rain tubing

84
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
right along here

85
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,120
and then all of a sudden you don't see

86
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,878
it in front of the plant that's because

87
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,319
the rain tubing kind of dips down here

88
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,759
we have a flood and drain table it's tie

89
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,399
wrapped below here and it comes up this

90
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,239
way

91
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,560
the reason why it drops low in this area

92
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,959
this allows easy access to plants in and

93
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,479
out

94
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,719
as well as growers to work their way in

95
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,079
and out with this setup the sensor

96
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,039
should be about one foot above the

97
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,440
tubing as we can see

98
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,079
right here to avoid potential incorrect

99
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,158
readings

100
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,800
and to provide an accurate assessment of

101
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,000
the enrichment level of carbon dioxide

102
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,519
in this grow space

103
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,360
this also keeps the rain tubing away

104
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,680
from the exhaust filter here

105
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
and you notice a small fan here to make

106
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,719
the distribution

107
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,840
even so there's no hot spots or

108
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,719
stratification

109
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,719
that occurs even in this small grow tent
