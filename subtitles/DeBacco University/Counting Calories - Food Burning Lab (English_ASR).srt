1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,640
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,759
the procedures for the counting calories

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,759
lab will be covered

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,079
[Music]

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,000
okay so here we go over the basics of

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,519
the calculating calories lab for food

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,719
what we're looking at here is our setup

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,879
we have a ring

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,358
a ring stand with a ring on it we have

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,439
an aluminum can with some nails in it to

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,560
help support it in addition we have a

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,479
thermometer

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,399
we have a wooden skewer we have some

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,359
weight boats we have a food item to be

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,000
testing

16
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,519
we have a balance we have some matches

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and we have a graduated cylinder so we

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
can precisely measure 50 milliliters of

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,759
water

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,119
we may also want to add a timer to this

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,320
setup so i'm going to go through the

22
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,320
basic instructions here

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,000
okay so now our next step is going to

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,039
involve putting the water here in our

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,878
can

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,439
so i'm going to go through

27
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,640
add our water right to the can that way

28
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,000
and then we're going to take the

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,079
temperature of that water taking our 50

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,799
milliliters of water and adding it to

31
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,798
our can right there

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,280
now how do we get the initial mass of

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,680
our food item well we take a weigh boat

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,840
we put it on our balance we make sure we

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,960
let it kind of settle out we tear the

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,640
balance

37
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,798
and we put our food item in in this case

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,478
it's going to be a marshmallow

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,479
here we're going to take our reading at

40
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,478
0.86

41
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,559
grams so that's it

42
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,959
0.85 grams so now we've got that we're

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
going to take our food item

44
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,919
take our wooden skewer and very

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,680
carefully

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,560
we want to be able to go through and

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,759
attach that right there

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,920
okay that's what we're going to use for

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,439
our next step now we just added the

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,439
water in our can we're going to take our

51
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,639
thermometer making sure not to keep it

52
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,559
at the bottom of the can to make sure

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,000
we're getting the temperature of only

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,439
the water there

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,200
so i'll put at the bottom and just raise

56
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,039
it up just a little bit and then we're

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,120
going to take a reading in this case our

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,680
reading is right around

59
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,719
22.4 degrees celsius so 22.4 degrees

60
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,040
celsius

61
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,959
that'll be our reading there

62
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,439
now comes the fun part so we're going to

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,840
grab our matches here make sure you're

64
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,280
weighing your safety goggles we have our

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,439
food item we're going to be looking at

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,800
placing that approximately

67
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,079
oh about that far under the can one

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
which we're not contacting the key in

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,560
our turn out too far we want it close

70
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,318
but we still want an ability for oxygen

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,000
to get in there to create an efficient

72
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,839
burn so i'm going to leave that down

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,318
there for a second we should also be if

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,239
we have another person be easier to time

75
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,318
how long this burns for so we take our

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,719
match

77
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,759
we light our match and remember the

78
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,000
hottest part of the flame is kind of

79
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,399
towards the top so we want to be using

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,639
that to help kind of get our marshmallow

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,439
here to catch on fire

82
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,679
and kind of want to rotate it through

83
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,199
blow that out keeping our food item lit

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,159
and you can see right here that nice

85
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,158
burn that we're getting

86
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,518
if it does fall you try to grab it again

87
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,239
and

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,920
and try to rotate it as best as possible

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,719
different food items i have a little

90
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,719
little issue there

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,519
and you could hear that the flame just

92
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,360
went out so i'm going to take this

93
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,799
marshmallow now that's burnt

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,480
grab a wave up put it in there be

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,719
careful that metal part of the skewer is

96
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,318
going to be quite hot

97
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,439
kick that off and it gets a little

98
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,439
sticky on the inside

99
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,519
i'll get that up there then before we

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,799
weigh that we want to make sure we're

101
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,480
getting the temperature of our water

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,920
relatively quickly

103
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,449
so we go through and now we're going to

104
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,318
assess the temperature of the water

105
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:51,919
[Laughter]

106
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,759
temperature water has gone up as would

107
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:58,399
be expected to

108
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,840
27.3 degrees celsius 27.3 degrees

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,039
celsius and keep in mind you don't want

110
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,479
the very bottom of the can at the bottom

111
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,239
just lift up that little bit so you're

112
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,518
getting the temperature of the water

113
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,360
itself

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,239
then we're going to come back over so we

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,640
got to get the mass of that food item so

116
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
i put an empty weight boat here we're

117
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,639
going to zero that out

118
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,639
take our burnt food item

119
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,720
put that in there and now we're going to

120
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,720
have a mass of only

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,800
0.60

122
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
grams our next food item on the wooden

123
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,478
skewer

124
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,319
i've got my matches ready to go we're

125
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,560
going to look at trying to time this as

126
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,719
well

127
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,399
so i go through i light my match

128
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,680
and remember we want to keep it at that

129
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,000
higher point in the match that's where

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,800
the flame is the hottest

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,800
work it back and forth

132
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,359
we'll slowly rotate it

133
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,079
and keep it just under that can there

134
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,959
again rotate so as much of a burn as

135
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,959
possible out of it

136
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,320
you can see all that carbon buildup on

137
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,439
the aluminum can

138
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,120
you don't want it right you want to

139
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,719
allow a little bit of a gap there to be

140
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,399
able to allow some oxygen for those

141
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,400
flames to go

142
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,638
you can see this is burning much longer

143
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,159
than our other item

144
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,960
that goes it's about completely burnt

145
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,720
out

146
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,719
it's gonna be a little bit of smoke left

147
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,639
you want to let that cool just for a

148
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,879
little bit

149
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,720
get our weibo

150
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,600
and kind of make sure it's not too too

151
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
hot

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,639
usually they cool down pretty quick

153
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
we're going to watch the metal

154
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,478
kick that there

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,400
we can get that weight in a moment

156
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,519
that's not going to change too much as

157
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,198
we're going to go through and get our

158
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,198
temperature of our water

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,080
and in comparison to when it started

160
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:00,560
while this one did have a longer burn

161
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:02,478
time we're now looking at 42.9

162
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
degrees celsius

163
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,079
so that's kind of that nice evaluation

164
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,439
there in the change so hopefully this

165
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,079
gives you a little bit of a basic idea

166
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,160
of how to run the cal the geometry lab

167
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,839
and looking at burning food and being

168
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,919
able to now take this data that we've

169
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,519
collected with the temperature change of

170
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,839
the water and to be able to go through

171
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,079
some math calculations to determine how

172
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,439
much energy was in various food items

173
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,959
now you can repeat this with many

174
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,719
different food items you're not just

175
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,560
limited to what i've shown you here the

176
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,160
wood skewers a good idea to be able to

177
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,079
support it safely

178
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,600
so keep in mind that this is a great

179
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,680
setup and you should also be doing

180
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,759
repeated trials because what would be

181
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
different masses for your food it should

182
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
all come out in the math because of the

183
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,240
calculations you're doing but always

184
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,000
good to have repeated trials it's fun to

185
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,840
think about too if you have a collection

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,439
of snacks which food and do you think

187
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,359
has the most energy to be able to go

188
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,279
through and compare to see if your

189
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,280
hypothesis or your prediction was

190
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,279
correct
