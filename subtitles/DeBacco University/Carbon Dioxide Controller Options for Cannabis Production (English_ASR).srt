00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,639
here on debaco university i'm going to

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,359
show you the three main controller

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,199
options

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,559
when enriching your area with carbon

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,440
dioxide and provide you with the

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:16,238
advantages

7
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:19,198
and disadvantages of each

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,278
[Music]

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,400
let's go over carmada carbon dioxide

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,118
controller options

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,118
for cannabis production so first off we

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,198
have the time to release carbon dioxide

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,198
and we see an example of one right here

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,079
the advantage is that this is very easy

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,320
to set up

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,079
you'll know exactly when you will need

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,759
to refill replace the bottle

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,840
because it's going to come on for a set

19
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,039
duration of time and off for a set

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,559
duration of time

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,640
we noticed about this one this also has

22
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,479
a photocell so this will ensure that

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,320
this cycle will only repeat

24
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,759
when the light's on or when the sunlight

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,558
is out which is when plants

26
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,320
will utilize carbon dioxide however the

27
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,238
disadvantages with this setup is it's

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,840
not reactive to the actual environment

29
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,198
it's going to inject co2 for the x

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,920
amount of time regardless whether it

31
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,238
needs it

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,799
or whether it doesn't this could cause

33
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,118
elevated levels and waste carbon dioxide

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,799
and while the timer itself might be

35
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,200
relatively inexpensive

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,360
you typically will be spending more in

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,719
wasted carbon dioxide over a growth

38
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,040
cycle

39
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,560
now controller without fuzzy logic so

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,920
the advantages is that it's less

41
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,359
expensive than one that would have

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,359
physiologic

43
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,599
it can work with bottled based or

44
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,959
heat-based carbon dioxide sources

45
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,879
so that's the advantage of using a

46
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,118
controller of this type the disadvantage

47
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,798
is

48
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,400
it can waste carbon dioxide particularly

49
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,159
for using the bottle system

50
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,040
and grow space may have a greater

51
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,719
variability in carbon dioxide levels

52
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,640
keep in mind that if you are using a

53
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,118
heat-based source you cannot use

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,159
fuzzy logic fuzzy logic there's other

55
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,759
videos on that

56
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
where you're able to kind of the

57
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,399
controller helps regulate and determine

58
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,560
what dosing duration and frequency it

59
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,159
needs to do using heat based sources you

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,920
can get away with a controller

61
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,399
that does not have the fuzzy logic

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,159
option see here also a light sensor

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,920
but if you are using a compressed bottle

64
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,920
system you probably want to look at

65
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
our third type here which is a

66
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,239
controller with fuzzy logic

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,318
simply because the advantages is that

68
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,719
this is a computer-based adjustment to

69
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,359
match

70
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,039
your particular growing space it's a

71
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,160
great way for the controller to kind of

72
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,159
learn your growth space

73
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,239
and help dial in the carbon dioxide

74
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,159
dosing the disadvantages it does have

75
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,599
the most upfront costs

76
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,759
it cannot be used with a burner or

77
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,119
heater style carbon dioxide generations

78
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,120
it can only be used with bottle based

79
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,039
systems however this

80
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,800
computer-based adjustments that go on

81
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,560
allow you to minimize

82
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,319
the amount of wasted carbon dioxide

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
you'd be using with a bottle system

84
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,679
and make your overall carbon dioxide

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,840
enrichment environment

86
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,439
as efficient as it can be especially

87
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,439
when using compressed bottles
