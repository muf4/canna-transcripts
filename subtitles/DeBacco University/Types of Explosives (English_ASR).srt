1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
this tobacco university lecture is going

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,000
to focus on different types

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,719
of explosives so first off we have the

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,440
low explosives and these have escaping

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,439
gases of about 3000 feet per second

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,960
and they're kind of a crucial element is

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,759
a physical mixture of

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
oxygen and fuel examples are black and

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,039
smokeless powders

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,199
these are a mixer mixture typically of

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,560
potassium nitrate charcoal and

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,400
sulfur smokeless powder is a nitrocellus

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,039
and perhaps a

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:35,280
nitroglycerin a kind of compound there

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,960
getting into high explosives well these

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,000
have a much quicker

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,640
velocity the escaping gases approach

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,840
10 000 feet per second and it's usually

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,039
oxygen

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,320
contained in a fuel molecule two types

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,359
we have the initiating which is

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,439
sensitive and will

23
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,280
detonate rapidly when subject to heat or

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,920
shock and it's used to

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,800
um you know other explosives from an

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
explosive

27
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,198
train we also have non-initiating which

28
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,959
is relatively insensitive requires heat

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,319
or shock to kind of cause that chain

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,478
reaction to occur

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,199
and this includes for example the ever

32
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,799
famous tnt

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,079
we have also chemical explosives as well

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,720
and these are ammonium nitrate fuel oil

35
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,200
anfo typically referred to as a black

36
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,438
powder

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
and dynamite would be classified under

38
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,599
that commercial explosive

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,560
category then we have military

40
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,759
explosives

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,439
so um c4 which is

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,040
also known as r dx

43
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,118
when we have a whole bunch of others

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,439
that can be mixed with tnt

45
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,478
to make grenades and other forms of

46
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,839
explosives

47
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,560
used in military settings lastly keeping

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,079
with the

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,159
military sadly something that the

50
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,399
military has to deal with a lot of

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,479
are called ieds and these stand for

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
improvised explosive devices

53
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,679
and these are typically low explosives

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
but they're placed in confined

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,880
containers which is what makes them so

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,478
dangerous an ied is a bomb constructed

57
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,239
and deployed in ways other than the

58
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,039
conventional military action

59
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,920
sadly typically put along roadsides so

60
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,920
that when uh

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,920
opposing military vehicles come by then

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,519
they are detonated at that point

63
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,280
they may be constructed of conventional

64
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,280
military explosives such as artillery

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,520
rounds attached to a detonating

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,719
mechanism nineties are commonly used as

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,200
roadside bombs

68
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,318
typically what you see here so this is

69
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,280
just a general

70
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:30,079
overview of the different

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,080
classifications of explosives
