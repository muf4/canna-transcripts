1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,430
well this importance of selected proper

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,589
light to use also how you place that

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:10,019
light in relation to your plants is of

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,750
equal person and even greater importance

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:16,230
to ensure maximum yield without doing

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,730
excessive plant damage so when we're

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,800
mounting our lights use of quality

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,019
ratchet a nurses advise for ease of

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,670
installation an added advantage of being

10
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:27,118
able to adjust the height of the light

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,580
be sure to the attachment Rings are

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,159
fully encapsulated and not open s-curves

13
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,238
these are fully uncap slates sometimes

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,859
you'll see some of these how they can

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,019
add some they just kind of hook on to

16
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,090
different areas that advise because

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,530
those could easily slip or if you bump

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,530
the light could cause the light to fall

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,600
of damage you and/or the plants and then

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,420
within 1/8 inch but quarter inch is

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,550
preferred when you're going to buy these

22
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,890
with each being able to support about a

23
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,929
hundred and fifty pounds or sell for the

24
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,390
pair in this example so you can always

25
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,549
up it a little bit more always worth

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,829
going a little bit higher rating than a

27
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,299
little bit less of a rating and here's

28
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,099
the example here's if you pull on the

29
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,560
ratchet strap that will help increase on

30
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,658
the height of this light and that can be

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,868
utilized well as the plants grow to

32
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,909
maintaining equal distance that distance

33
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:17,040
off of those lights to the plants the

34
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,990
light should be kept a constant distance

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,880
from the plants but remember that plants

36
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:22,408
grow so if you fix the light in a

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,269
certain area it could be a challenge

38
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,070
using this ratchet straps will allow you

39
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:27,929
to raise the light as the plants are

40
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,539
growing which makes for a great

41
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,280
consistent conditions this is important

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,259
because the distance can vastly reduced

43
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,118
the light intensity which could cause

44
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,530
plants to stretch so you just found a

45
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,569
light really high and say oh they can

46
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,060
use diffuse light if they're not getting

47
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,949
enough light they hit stretch and that

48
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,250
could cause all sorts of issues as you

49
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,840
get later in the grow cycle this is

50
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,000
because there's an exponential decay of

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,609
light follow the inverse square law for

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,290
light as you increase the distance this

53
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:57,209
is the relationship between light source

54
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,079
and the distance the light needs to

55
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:03,298
travel and as we get further away in

56
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:05,750
distance we have an exponentially

57
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,280
decreasing amount of light intensity

58
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,560
intensity equals the output divided by

59
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,680
the distance squared because this is

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,390
square that's the key term here you can

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,150
let's compare two plants of the same

62
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:20,309
light so plant is one foot away from

63
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,099
that light source plant B is two feet

64
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,049
away it's double the distance however

65
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:27,750
because it's the inverse square law and

66
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:29,790
distance is squared plant B is not

67
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,419
receiving half the light we see the only

68
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:36,209
25% of the light that plant a is that's

69
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,638
that in the first square law also it's

70
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,799
very important that that distance be

71
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,629
maintained consistently because if it's

72
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,609
allowed to get a little bit too far you

73
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:47,668
could see here how the amount of light

74
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:50,120
is exponentially smaller because that

75
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:52,769
distance of term is squared

76
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,489
lastly closer to the light source isn't

77
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:55,109
always better

78
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,878
sometimes a plant is close to the light

79
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,950
source it will burn this needs to be

80
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:03,090
taken into consideration especially for

81
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:05,310
high intense lights plasmas also are

82
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,009
advised or LEP s are advised to be at

83
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,569
least 2 feet away to be to burn so again

84
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:11,568
just because we're closer the light

85
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:13,738
sources and always been the case for

86
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:15,899
fluorescence definitely want those

87
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,739
closer so keep in mind that closer is

88
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,599
not always better

89
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,219
depends on the type of light you're

90
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,219
using in the stage of plant growth
