1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,588
you may hear some people say oh I've got

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,150
hard water and we're trying to give a

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,160
little shed some light on what it

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,990
actually means then what it doesn't mean

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,210
it doesn't mean ice or ice fishing

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,099
fishing the hard water hard water has to

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,260
refer to water here that contains a lot

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,539
of minerals in it it can present some

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,760
challenges to people in piping systems

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,740
here so hard water is water that

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,260
contains elevated levels of calcium and

12
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:28,698
magnesium typically above 150 milligrams

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:33,120
of calcium carbonate per liter that have

14
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:35,760
limestone it deposits can be located in

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,320
soil and what hard water forms when

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,210
water passes through these limestone

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,878
deposits as you did would be in the soil

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,009
kind of the unscientific way to test for

19
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,378
hard water we identified water that will

20
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,509
not allow soap to form bubbles when

21
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,339
mixed are added and that's because of

22
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,890
the calcium a high levels of calcium

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,660
magnesium that it contains so we can

24
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,058
damage metal fittings this is important

25
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,828
you're running an irrigation system you

26
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,358
can cause some issues with fittings that

27
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,939
you may have over time you can also

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,859
result build-up or calcification so here

29
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,899
we can see the outline of a pipe here

30
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,909
and you can see the layers that it build

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,650
up and how small the diameter is of this

32
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,510
pipe so now that you have all this build

33
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,549
up in here this is also reducing your

34
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,009
flow and this could be important if

35
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,170
you're looking at maximizing movement of

36
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,329
water and planning out an irrigation

37
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,420
system this can severely restrict it you

38
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,239
can cause issues in the total volume

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,740
that you're getting to your plants can

40
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,209
have cholera can also have high sodium

41
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,368
levels which can lead to nutrient

42
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,679
deficiencies chlorine is needed by the

43
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,629
plants but only in small quantities they

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,210
may like a small pinch of salt they want

45
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:40,349
to be adding spoonfuls of salt here

46
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:41,789
because it can really mess with the

47
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,429
cation exchange capacity

48
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,380
so while chlorine is needed it's not

49
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,040
needed it in very high amounts in plants

50
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,509
high amounts can damage plants alas I

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,299
will watch for high levels of chlorine

52
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,069
in a Corvette imide sorry since this can

53
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,759
kill beneficial microbes that you may be

54
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:01,468
trying to add or trying to propagate so

55
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,390
when we're looking at hard water or

56
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:05,658
sometimes treatment of that if you have

57
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,920
high levels of chlorine you can be

58
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,270
damaging microbes that you're directly

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,250
adding to your water before you even

60
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,680
apply it to your plants especially if

61
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,949
you're considering using organic compost

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,930
tea

63
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,429
other micro conditions you know might

64
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,890
keep a plate nice and sterile but if

65
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,840
you're adding with the intention of

66
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,429
adding these microbes you add to water

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,469
that contains high-level Corrine or

68
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,599
these other sterilants you can be

69
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:30,348
basically killing the good microbes that

70
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,348
you're trying to add
