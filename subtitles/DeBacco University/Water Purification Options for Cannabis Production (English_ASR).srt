1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,560
here on debaco university i'm going to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,849
go over water purification options for

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,539
cannabis production

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:09,539
[Music]

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,600
when growing cannabis due to tight

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,039
standards and often regulations

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,118
want to make sure everything is clean

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,679
and consistent as possible

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,118
so water purification is an important

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,480
part of this process

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,278
so what are some of the options when it

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,159
comes to purifying your water

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,920
so purification filtration this

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,078
purification process is removing

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,000
undesirable chemicals biological

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,039
contaminants suspended solids

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,280
and gases from water there is a variety

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,799
of methods that can be used which is per

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,439
dependent on the initial water

20
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,839
conditions and what the target substance

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,039
is

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,879
to be removed so choosing your options

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,239
first determines what do you potentially

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,919
want to look at targeting when you're

25
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,959
looking at removing

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,559
so water volume versus water quality

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,239
when we're looking at the two here

28
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,519
growers need to have a water

29
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,079
purification system

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
that will supply enough volume of water

31
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,879
for the amount of plants they intend on

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
growing

33
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,118
however depending on the type of water

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
is initially incoming into the facility

35
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,640
this can impact the type of water

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,799
purification system used

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,478
sometimes to get the proper quality of

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,320
water takes time and can reduce

39
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,840
volume be produced you see here with

40
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,959
kind of a distillation system they put

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,118
water in they trap

42
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,438
capture with the dome that's great if

43
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,118
you only need to water with this much

44
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,959
however in many other cases you need a

45
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,560
lot more volume

46
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,000
so how can you ensure you have a good

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,118
quality while still maintaining the

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,640
right volume

49
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,560
if it's under what's required by the

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,519
plants is there's going to be issues

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,478
you're going to have

52
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,158
stress issues with simply lack of water

53
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,759
also growers need to factor in the

54
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,478
volume of their plants will consume on a

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,399
hot day

56
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,640
at full maturity you might be able to

57
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,759
get by it's you know propagation stage

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,439
but at maturity hot day can you supply

59
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,718
enough water with your chosen

60
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,919
purification system some growers have to

61
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,519
deal with hard water or

62
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
soft water so what's the difference

63
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,079
between these two well for hard water

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
this has high content of dissolved

65
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
minerals

66
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,799
which is hard which make it primarily

67
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,039
high in calcium

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
in magnesium content it's measured in

69
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,759
milligrams

70
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,400
of calcium salts per liter of water

71
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,120
typically and as we can see here

72
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,280
200 to 400 is in the range of hard water

73
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,840
while 400 to 450 is considered to be

74
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,318
very hard water typical tap water is in

75
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,039
that 170 to 190 milligrams per liter and

76
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,719
while this is not

77
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,479
dangerous to humans consuming this type

78
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,479
of water can potentially

79
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,000
be harmful to cannabis and especially

80
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,238
for mixing it with other

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,759
nutrients self water contains little

82
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,560
minerals to none at all

83
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,280
under 150 is considered very soft to 150

84
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,759
to 200

85
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
is just simply soft water rain water

86
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,560
purified ionized and distilled water are

87
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,879
examples of

88
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
soft water with rain water once it

89
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,359
collects soil particles and minerals the

90
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,680
hardness scale

91
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,680
can go up so be mindful of where you're

92
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,040
collecting potentially that rain water

93
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,959
you want a general comparison between

94
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,959
hard and soft water little definition

95
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,519
formation ions and effects are presented

96
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,000
here

97
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,200
if you want more details now getting

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,519
into some specifics

99
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,878
so there is reverse osmosis and this is

100
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,360
essentially produces

101
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,000
pure water with an electroconnectivity

102
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,120
of zero

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,680
in zero parts per million it is a very

104
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,039
pure system however the disadvantage of

105
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,640
this system while you think what could

106
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,798
be wrong with it producing

107
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,399
zero vc or zero parts per million it's a

108
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,080
very slow process

109
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
it also generates a wastewater that's

110
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,120
not harmful it's just not used it needs

111
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,360
to be

112
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,640
disposed of or have a drain associated

113
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,319
with that

114
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,000
also in the system the membranes need to

115
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,280
be replaced to prevent micro

116
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,479
contamination of the water over time

117
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,199
tap water tap water as easily

118
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,919
comes directly out of the tap typically

119
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,238
also called

120
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,759
city water the disadvantage of tap water

121
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,039
is it can have potential contaminants

122
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,719
in it can be may restrict what nutrients

123
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,000
growers can add so talk about

124
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,519
contaminants we're not talking about

125
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
necessarily anything that's harmful

126
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,719
just potential for like chlorine or

127
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,560
other

128
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,239
minerals that may make it more limiting

129
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,080
on the amount of nutrients a grower can

130
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,560
add to that water

131
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,280
then we have a carbon filtration system

132
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,680
the advantage is that is remove chlorine

133
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,720
volatile organic compounds called vocs

134
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,560
taste and odor can also remove sediment

135
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,440
but this will reduce the filters

136
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
useful life expectancy so to speak the

137
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,199
disadvantages is it does not remove

138
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,759
minerals salts or dissolved organic

139
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,439
substances so again that comes back to

140
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,879
what are you trying to remove from your

141
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,800
water is this a good fit

142
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,719
for what you have in it has a

143
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
contaminant in your water

144
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,400
and lastly we have a sediment filter so

145
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,879
this removes physical particles from the

146
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,279
water

147
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,959
it's often used as a pre-filter before

148
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,399
other filtration methods to simply

149
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,959
increase the longevity

150
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,839
of the other filters the downfall of the

151
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,519
sediment filters

152
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,119
only removes particles and not chemicals

153
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,758
or contaminants

154
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,720
the finer the screen that the sediment

155
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,960
filter has

156
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,080
typically the slower rate of flow so

157
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,079
that might be important when you're

158
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,758
doing calculations to make sure

159
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,240
you can supply your plants with enough

160
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,879
flow while also delivering the right

161
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,639
quality

162
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,639
of water if you need any more

163
