00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,400
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,160
going to go over digital monitoring

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,190
systems for indoor cannabis

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,269
production

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,269
[Music]

6
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:17,198
[Music]

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,960
all right let's get into the details of

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,640
digital monitoring for environmental

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,760
conditions in a cannabis production

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,679
facility

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
so first off the advantages of digital

12
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:29,198
monitoring systems is that they're often

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,240
uh offer very precise readouts they can

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,719
be preset with

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,238
minimum and maximum levels for alarms

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,600
that can alert the grower when something

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,320
gets out of the

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
intended target range they're also very

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,878
easy to read

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,640
which makes it great for people who have

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,558
to go through and document if there's

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,719
multiple shifts of people coming through

23
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,799
a grow area

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
uh digital precision so what's the

25
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,718
advantage again of these

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,120
digital systems well these digital

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,879
readouts provide precise readouts this

28
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,359
can be important when small details can

29
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:59,839
cause an

30
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,198
impact on the growing operation it can

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,320
also offer

32
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,719
the advance of having multiple sensors

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,759
in the same area to help gain an idea of

34
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,840
the potential

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,600
microclimate that may exist you can have

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,478
multiple sensors all feeding into one

37
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,798
computer

38
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,000
all one data logger able then to see

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,720
what's the temperature

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,319
closer to the container level top of the

41
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,519
plants above the lights below the lights

42
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,319
near the door

43
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,640
this can allow for a great accumulation

44
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,639
of

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,159
information and very precise information

46
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,680
as well

47
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,680
uh digital monitorings can also

48
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,759
self-monitor so that means that they're

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,799
able to go through and

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,400
it can be preset to provide more of a

51
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
hands-off approach to help ensure that

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,079
when conditions get out of range

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,200
an immediate reaction can take place

54
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,118
when temperature gets too

55
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,200
high you can immediately kick on a

56
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,840
potential alarm or potential sensor

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,200
or a fan as well this can also apply to

58
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,359
making preset adjustments

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,439
at certain times or given certain

60
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,599
conditions and this can help again

61
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,478
create the more ideal environment for

62
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,959
those plants

63
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,478
more consistently over a longer period

64
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,319
of time

65
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,640
now those digital readouts again in

66
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,560
operations uh that have multiple workers

67
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
due to rats can be preferred

68
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,759
simply because there is no

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,199
interpretation needed what was the

70
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,159
humidity when you walked in what was the

71
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,598
temperature

72
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,520
well it was the last 24 hours min and

73
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,719
max as we can see right here it offers

74
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,400
it very precisely

75
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,598
there's no trying to read where is the

76
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,439
line compared to to the dial so to speak

77
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,878
however despite the advantages of the

78
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,639
digital systems offer

79
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,639
many brewers invest in a full digital

80
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,559
system but may also have some analog

81
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,559
monitors to provide a backup

82
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,920
just in case something was to go wrong

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
what if the battery is tight what if

84
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,119
they lose power

85
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
having an analog system is usually

86
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,400
provided by a lot of growers as a simple

87
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,800
backup to their digital systems however

88
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,719
where digital systems should be used

89
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,360
or higher priorities for digital systems

90
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,878
would be ph because a tenth of a point

91
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
can make a large difference

92
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,318
carbon accident enrichment as you can

93
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,759
see here making sure we're getting to

94
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,238
the right parts per million

95
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,878
and then light levels to par reading

96
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,360
where

97
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,799
digital sensors can be used but are a

98
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,040
little less to a degree

99
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
our temperature in humidity long as

100
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,318
you're generally close

101
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,560
that might be good enough but as you can

102
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,399
see here some of the sensors that are

103
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,039
also doing some of these other things

104
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,319
also can log temperature as well as

105
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,479
relative humidity

106
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,560
so good again more data can be a good

107
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,079
thing here to log that

108
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,920
lastly though just to keep in mind that

109
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,799
no matter what system you're using a

110
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,119
sensor is only as good as its placement

111
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,879
there's additional video here on tobacco

112
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,599
university to go over where to place

113
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,359
sensors

114
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,119
that's very important to ensure the

115
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
reading you're getting

116
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,560
is going to be representative of the

117
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
growing environment
