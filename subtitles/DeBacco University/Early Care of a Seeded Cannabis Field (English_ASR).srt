00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,919
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,040
investigating early care of seated

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,400
cannabis field

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,480
so here we see an example of this now

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,160
this looks like just a field here

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,080
with some drip lines but there are

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,199
actual canvas plants planted here with a

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,600
drip irrigation

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,839
and a living cover down between the rows

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,679
so let's investigate some of the details

11
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:31,278
associated with this canvas field here

12
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:33,759
on debaco university

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,519
all right let's get into the video here

14
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,159
so first off when we're looking at

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,040
a cannabis field or really any field uh

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,359
the preparation

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,359
is an important part of the process so

18
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,079
the seeding of a field is the last step

19
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,679
after much

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,439
needed field preparation have been

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,320
completed if it wants to get in start

22
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,159
with the plants

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,920
you want to make sure that the field is

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,718
ready before you even think about

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,239
planting

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,920
the soil disturbance should be minimal

27
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,359
as this can be important for the

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,239
germination process you want to go

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,679
through and

30
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,439
plant a bunch of seeds and then go

31
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,558
through and mess up the soil because

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,359
you'll be damaging

33
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,239
what you've worked so hard to accomplish

34
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,719
early on

35
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,560
during the process root development is

36
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,400
just starting so be sure to avoid the

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,760
seedlings from drying out

38
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,880
in this case here we're using drip

39
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,400
irrigation you may have to run it

40
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,399
potentially a little bit longer

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
to ensure this very small area where the

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,640
root is is actually getting adequate

43
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,640
water or irrigation to it ensure the

44
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,159
water is reaching the actual plants

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,840
so ensure this small root zone is

46
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,520
getting sufficient moisture

47
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
and this can be accomplished by a simple

48
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,719
field check and

49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,400
making sure you're running and have

50
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,519
something installed ahead of time or

51
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
shortly after

52
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,359
you go through and add the seedlings

53
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,000
here to ensure that they are going to be

54
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,879
getting adequate

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,078
moisture and with any planting you

56
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,879
always want to be sure that you're

57
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,559
watching for

58
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,078
weeds early on campus plants are not

59
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,118
very competitive with weeds

60
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,438
so you want to make sure your weed

61
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,840
control is good throughout the season

62
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,279
but especially early on week control

63
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,840
just prior to planting is important

64
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,599
because this will

65
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,960
increase the odds of successfully newly

66
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,959
emerged cannabis seedlings

67
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,879
develop what's called a good field stand

68
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,478
or a good amount of plants

69
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,519
within your field there lastly here we

70
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,399
want to be mindful

71
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,079
of if you need to over plant because

72
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,360
you're using dice's seeds meaning

73
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,319
50 will be male so feminist seeds is

74
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
encouraged

75
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,519
but still be on the lookout for a

76
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,920
potential rogue male plant where

77
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,280
as when it gets closer to flowering time

78
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,639
even if you're using feminized seed that

79
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,719
stays 99

80
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,559
female this means one out of every 100

81
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,000
plants will be male on average

82
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,759
if you're growing a large number of

83
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,560
plants that can be a large number of

84
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,079
males

85
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,159
and typically you're growing them in a

86
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
very efficient manner so if you have a

87
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,439
couple males in a field that could

88
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,359
potentially lead to a lot of

89
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,280
seeded and a lot of successful

90
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
pollination thus reducing your

91
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,318
cannabinoids so keep in mind again if

92
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,598
you're using feminized

93
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,079
seed great but even if 99 or 99.5

94
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,560
percent

95
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,879
that is not 100 and you should still be

96
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,878
scouting your fields at flowering time
