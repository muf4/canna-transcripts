1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,198
if you're growing chemist plants

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,439
outdoors you may have heard

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,278
of indoor growers flushing their plants

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,599
again only applies to them

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,400
however this can also apply to outdoor

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,719
growing

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,080
of cannabis and this debaco university

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,518
video will provide you with some

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,198
specifics on how to flush

10
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,199
outdoor grown cannabis plants

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,519
[Music]

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,118
all right let's look at flushing outdoor

13
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,118
grown cannabis plants

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,479
well first off realize that there is no

15
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,399
standardized method

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,159
no studies have been published to date

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,799
that examine the exact process of

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,799
flushing

19
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,640
cannabis plants however this does not

20
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,878
mean that is not common practice

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,840
as the idea to produce high quality bud

22
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,558
and also minimize

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
inputs is in the play meaning that we're

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,238
looking at

25
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,878
how can we maximize our production and

26
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,078
minimize

27
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,960
our inputs to have the best efficiency

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,558
as possible with our final end product

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,160
now the goal of any flushing protocol

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,839
indoors or outdoors is to

31
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,839
reduce nutrient concentrations in the

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,000
root zone so the plant metabolizes what

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
is already present in the plant tissue

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,799
so it's really easy to think about in an

35
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,399
indoor growing situation we have a lot

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,640
of water added to a container

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
and the water is being over added sort

38
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320
of speaking allowing it to drain

39
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,239
out of the container away from the root

40
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,158
zone taking nutrients with it

41
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,920
a little harder to do in an outdoor

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,960
setup but i'll go over some specifics

43
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,320
for you

44
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,000
now the water properties that you want

45
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,639
to be flushing with ideally the water

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,799
should be around room temperature 70 75

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,478
and have a slightly acidic ph value of

48
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,400
6.0 to 6.3

49
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,239
because this will aid in the ability to

50
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,680
ensure nutrients are soluble

51
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,158
and easily removed via the water this

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,118
maximizes the efficiency of removing

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,560
those nutrients

54
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,399
dissolving those nutrients and getting

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,879
them away from the root zone

56
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,159
so this can be great to have a little ph

57
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,280
tester this is a little bit more of a

58
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,799
higher end

59
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
testosterone also gives it temperature

60
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,439
and everything but good to have some

61
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,439
idea

62
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,519
of what your water properties that

63
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,599
you'll be irrigating with

64
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,039
so the first nutrient to go when you're

65
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,879
doing this process will be

66
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,320
nitrogen because it's the most water

67
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,159
soluble of the nutrients

68
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,359
so watch for a potential deficiency of

69
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,919
this nutrient first

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,560
in the plant you'll know you're having

71
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,839
nitrogen

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,598
deficiency and it's because it's

73
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,479
characterized by the lowering

74
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,639
lower leaves becoming yellow while the

75
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,318
upper portions of the leaves will remain

76
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,919
green at least for a period of time if

77
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,359
you run this for too long especially the

78
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,719
whole plant will go yellow

79
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
if you start to see this kind of

80
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,479
yellowing of the lower leaves you might

81
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,199
be flushing too early in the plant

82
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,560
growth cycle or too aggressively so keep

83
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,518
that in mind it's a great kind of way to

84
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,318
check

85
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,280
and balance your system there now timing

86
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,439
is important

87
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,878
as we can see here with this image the

88
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,120
goal is to time the reduction in

89
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,959
nutrients with the harvesting of the

90
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
the buds of the end product when the

91
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,000
plant runs out of nutrients this should

92
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,639
be very close to harvesting so there's

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,598
no plant stunting or a chance at yield

94
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,958
reduction

95
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,039
note this is best done if you're going

96
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,959
to be harvesting the entire plant

97
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,598
and not doing a selective bud harvest as

98
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,680
this may result in the second harvest

99
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,439
being negatively impacted by the

100
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,719
reduction in plant available

101
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,639
nutrients now growing uh conditions do

102
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,080
play a role in this so you've got to

103
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,479
take this into consideration

104
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,920
are the plants grown in field soil or

105
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,560
the plants growing outside

106
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,639
in containers for field soil what's the

107
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,560
soil texture composition for example

108
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,158
it's a percent sand silt and clay

109
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,759
that's going to play a role if you're

110
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,719
going in containers what are the size of

111
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
the containers

112
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,560
and what substrate is also found in

113
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,199
those containers it'll also

114
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,199
impact your protocol to file for the

115
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,560
flushing process

116
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,679
now we're looking at field soils they

117
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,199
say they present sand silt and clay

118
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,640
we go to our kind of triangle here

119
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,119
to kind of determine are we in a clay

120
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,518
soil a silt loam a clay loam

121
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,400
sandy loam that all plays into it in

122
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,879
general though

123
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
as a percentage of clays increase so

124
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,239
does the length of time

125
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,039
of the flushing period this can be as

126
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,400
much as 15 to 20 days because clay tends

127
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,878
to hold onto

128
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
nutrients much for a much longer period

129
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,518
of time

130
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
so as you work your way up here and your

131
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,280
percentage clay increases

132
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,640
so will your duration of time that

133
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,360
should be flushing

134
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,119
sandy loams down in this region are

135
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,400
typically recommended to flush for 10 to

136
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,000
15 days

137
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,238
as always this can depend on how

138
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,040
aggressive the plants are being fed

139
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,918
leading up to harvest as well also

140
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,160
realize

141
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,560
that flushing is not truly possible as

142
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,400
the roots will likely be quite extensive

143
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
but the period of time where only waters

144
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,638
being added can help reduce the cost

145
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
and impact the final yield and not

146
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,478
impact the finally that i should say if

147
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,639
done

148
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,000
properly so this is great a great way to

149
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,680
kind of reduce your cost

150
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,600
you will not be able to fully flush your

151
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,759
plants as a container grower can

152
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,120
can do but this is a great way to reduce

153
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,639
your overall cost

154
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,399
reduce your chance of environmental

155
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,639
contamination while not

156
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,839
impacting in any negative way your final

157
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,960
yield

158
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,319
so if you're growing outdoors in

159
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,279
containers which some growers do the

160
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,360
container size

161
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,638
is something to take into consideration

162
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,919
large containers will typically make

163
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,280
flushing more difficult

164
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,439
simply because of total volume of

165
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,159
material and increased likelihood

166
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,600
of holding on to nutrients typically

167
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,880
large containers you can favor in that

168
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,360
10 to 12 days

169
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,360
smaller containers make for easy over

170
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,919
saturation so the duration of flush time

171
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,960
can be reduced at five to seven days

172
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,439
and then we have the substrate

173
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,799
composition if the substrate holds

174
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,038
nutrients the flush time should be

175
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,879
longer than if it's more easily drained

176
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,478
for example sandy soils that drain very

177
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,079
easily compared to clay soils

178
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,599
and that's why you see such a large span

179
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,599
of 5 to 15

180
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,039
days here complete saturation and

181
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
flushing may not be feasible

182
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,399
but not adding nutrients this is

183
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,720
reducing cost and not

184
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,159
ideally impacting the final product if

185
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,400
done properly

186
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,439
so your basic flushing protocol just in

187
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,198
general here

188
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,439
would be while this can be a challenge

189
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,120
when uh the water is leading the

190
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,199
determined when the water is leaving the

191
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,360
root zone it cannot be

192
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,520
measured as a very large container or

193
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,080
field soil saturations so general

194
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,918
estimates

195
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,758
need to be applied generally the

196
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,439
starting point to initial irrigate with

197
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,280
two and a half to three times the volume

198
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,160
of water as a normal irrigation event

199
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,758
would occur

200
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
followed by normal volumes of plain

201
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,120
water for the duration of the time

202
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,318
suggested in each situation

203
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,079
some growers like to do this kind of

204
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,960
heavy flush period to really force that

205
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,399
water

206
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,799
plant water through to really force some

207
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,038
of those nutrients out of the root zone

208
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,639
not necessarily required but you can

209
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:23,519
have one irrigation event maybe when you

210
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,519
initially start to

211
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,879
start the flushing process that is a

212
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,758
little bit longer duration than you

213
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,800
normally would

214
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,319
to initiate this flushing protocol

215
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,319
hopefully this helps you an outdoor

216
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,039
growing situation to reduce some of your

217
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,360
inputs

218
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,159
without reducing your yields to help

219
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,280
maximize

220
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,280
your efficiency
