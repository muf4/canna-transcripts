00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,520
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,000
video

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,040
here looking at identifying basic bones

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,559
of the body

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,400
so here we're going to look at parts of

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,919
the skeletal system and some of the

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,960
major bones that you should be

8
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,519
able to recognize and identify

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,359
well starting in general with bones well

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,559
bones are comprised

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,880
the vertebral skeleton of animals which

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,198
protects the various organs of the body

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,198
this is an endoskeleton it looks kind of

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,079
very porous as we can see here

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,800
and in those pores when the organism is

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,799
living

17
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,640
it will produce red and white blood

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,238
cells it also store minerals provide

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,719
structure and support for the body

20
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,320
and enable mobility bones come in a

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,239
variety of shapes and sizes and have

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,679
complex internal and external structures

23
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,199
that's lightweight but yet

24
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,280
strong i'm going to go over some of

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,640
those focusing mainly on the human body

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,359
here

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
so when we're classifying our bones we

28
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,479
have

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,600
four general classifications as

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,238
presented here

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,439
we have the long bones which include the

32
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,558
femur tibula

33
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,158
tibia fibula humerus radius and ulna we

34
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,798
also have short bones and those are the

35
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,920
carpals

36
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,600
of the wrist and tarsals of the ankle we

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,079
have our flat bones like for example our

38
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,239
skull

39
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,959
or sternum and an irregular bone such as

40
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,719
our vertebrae or our pelvis

41
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,239
and here we have the skull and mandible

42
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,118
and the skull is the bony structure that

43
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,039
forms the head

44
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,400
and vertebrates it supports the

45
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,000
structure of the face provides a

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,000
protective cavity for the brain

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
and over here we see a collection of

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
skulls

49
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,439
the mandible is the lower jaw or what's

50
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,880
typically referred to as a jaw bone

51
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,879
and is the largest strongest bone in the

52
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,000
human face and it holds the lower teeth

53
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,478
in place

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,680
in the image directly over here we

55
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,679
notice it's highlighted

56
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,118
in green to highlight exactly where the

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,720
mandible is located

58
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,319
uh in distinct relation to the skull

59
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,399
now we have something called vertebrae

60
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,158
and these are individual bones that

61
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,960
comprise the verbal column that has

62
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,118
curves

63
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,640
the natural curves have more add more

64
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,920
strength and a straight line so it can

65
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,079
support the weight of the body and

66
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,519
provide balance needed to walk

67
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,759
the sections of the verbal column

68
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,639
include the cervical thoracic

69
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,360
and the lumbar regions we can see the

70
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,639
cervical

71
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
here's the thoracic here's the lumbar

72
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,839
and then the fused areas way down here

73
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,680
would be

74
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,920
the pelvic region in addition

75
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,599
then we have the rib cage and ribcage

76
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,439
functions to protect the heart and lungs

77
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,919
in the thoracic cavity

78
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,878
also aids in respiration provide support

79
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,598
for the upper

80
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,679
limbs three main classifications of ribs

81
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,839
based on different points of attachment

82
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
we have our true or fixed ribs that have

83
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
a direct point of attachment to the

84
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
sternum

85
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,039
we have our false ribs and these kind of

86
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,878
have this kind of cartilage connection

87
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,598
that then attaches to the sternum

88
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,840
and then we have the floating ribs here

89
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,799
which are simply not attached in any way

90
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
to the sternum

91
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,080
however this image is a slightly

92
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,840
inaccurate this rib here should have a

93
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,719
piece of cartilage attaching it there

94
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,319
there should only be two floating ribs

95
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,439
those attachment points

96
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,919
those again those true libs true ribs

97
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,439
one through seven are attached to that

98
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,238
coastal cartilage directly to that

99
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,519
sternum

100
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,280
the false ribs here are

101
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,920
8 through 10 and are not attached to the

102
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,318
sternum but to the coastal cartilage

103
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,158
of the 7th rib above then the floating

104
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,799
ribs will last two 11 and 12

105
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,799
are only attached to the vertebrae and

106
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,719
no direct attachment even with cartilage

107
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,280
to the sternum

108
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,120
then we have the pelvis this is the area

109
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,039
of attachment of the upper leg bones and

110
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,759
contains portions of the vertebral

111
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,400
column

112
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,079
those fused portions down here and we

113
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,039
can see this is definitely an irregular

114
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,959
bone

115
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,719
one of the strongest bones because it is

116
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,560
the main point of attachment

117
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,680
and a lot of the weight and pressure is

118
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,080
exerted in this area of the body

119
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,000
then we get to our leg bones and these

120
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,000
uh we have the femur here the large

121
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,158
one here it's a thigh bone it's the

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
longest bone and is considered to be the

123
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,519
strongest bone in the body

124
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,199
they have the patella which is known as

125
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,319
the kneecap it's a flat circular

126
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,798
triangular bone

127
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,598
that protects the knee joint we have the

128
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
fibula

129
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,759
which is the long thin and lateral bone

130
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,400
of the lower leg and is parallel to the

131
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,679
tibia

132
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
and helps stabilize the ankle and

133
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,799
support the muscles of the lower leg

134
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,798
and we have the tibia here known as the

135
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,600
shin bone and is the second largest bone

136
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,758
in the body

137
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,919
a lot of people confuse the tibia in the

138
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,319
fibula tibia you can think as

139
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,680
thicker i'm here because it is a thicker

140
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,040
of the two bones

141
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,400
in the lower leg looking at the arm now

142
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,000
we have the humerus

143
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,000
and we have the radius in the ulna here

144
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,240
so we can see initially kind of a

145
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,639
similar structure that we saw in the leg

146
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,000
but of course on smaller bones overall

147
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,160
and the radius and ulna

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,918
allows a rotation uh to occur there

149
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,320
we get into the hands and the hand is

150
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,439
located at the distal end of each arm

151
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,279
it's the end

152
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,600
and we can see we have our carpals which

153
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,319
are kind of the wrist bones there

154
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,919
the metacarpals and then the phalanges

155
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,000
um that we have here

156
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,000
and there would be an interior and a

157
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
posterior view when we're looking at

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,160
the rotation of how those would be

159
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,639
presented

160
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,080
and lastly we have the feet and this is

161
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,840
the terminal portion of the limb which

162
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,639
bears the weight and allows locomotion

163
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,839
or movement

164
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,079
can also be important for footprints

165
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,879
looking at the foot here in the bone

166
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,079
structure we see

167
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,240
very similar to the hands so be

168
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,839
mindful of that that there are a lot of

169
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,918
similarities between the

170
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,918
upper limbs and lower limbs and being

171
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,359
able to provide a distinction of those
