1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
okay someone who's new to cannabis

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,580
growing or just gets a recent medical

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:07,410
license and ones that start growing

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,480
typically economy refer to those it's

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,580
kind of a hobby cannabis growers and

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,679
they will look for locations that are

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,109
kind of easily accessible so I'm gonna

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,420
give you kind of some basic ideas of the

9
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,480
room locations they may choose also with

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,010
some pros and cons associated those so

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,868
first off the basement for Hobby

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,349
burrowers it's relatively consistent

13
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:31,079
conditions easy to access kind of down

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,659
below is a nice typically as to deal

15
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,149
with water potentially easy to access to

16
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,339
bring large plant materials it can be

17
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,100
hard to kind of clear out or get

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,500
prepared to grow also hanging lights

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,059
convenient issue want to be careful of

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,859
the moisture of the basement does flood

21
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:50,869
so there can be some issues associated

22
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:53,429
with that an attic or hobby growers

23
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:55,919
typically mill minimal effort to set up

24
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:58,799
typically large and airy access to fresh

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,329
outside air our temperature fluctuations

26
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,399
can be extreme so it's important that

27
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,280
climate control is considered in this

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,140
type of setup looking at the garage or

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,750
shed for hobby growers typically there's

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,329
a quick easy large space easily defined

31
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,180
access to power can be very easy as long

32
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:18,060
as bringing in outside air

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,118
however the downfall is here what we're

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,769
looking at you know garages or sheds

35
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:24,868
there can be issues with having enough

36
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,819
power moving cars moving certain

37
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:28,828
furnitures keeping things clean and

38
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,319
sterile can also be an issue as garage

39
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:33,298
or shed operations this is why if you're

40
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,919
going to become a dedicated grower

41
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,750
especially for medical purposes you want

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,228
to have a room that's specifically

43
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,688
allocated with good cleanliness good

44
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:45,118
access to power to allow not only an

45
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:47,639
efficient grow and a safe route but also

46
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,099
one that is clean and won't breathe a

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,899
lot of diseases and cause issues so

48
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,609
that's one of the issues with the hobby

49
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,530
growers in general is that they can kind

50
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:57,780
of be quickly put together and that can

51
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,430
lead to a lot of negative effects both

52
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,430
in the plant and in product
