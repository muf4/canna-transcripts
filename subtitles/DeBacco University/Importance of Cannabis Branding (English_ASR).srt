32
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,199

53
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,839

person

58
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,519

64
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,159
degree and experience within the field

65

00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,399
cannabis industry

69
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,000

70
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,200
coming up with new ways

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,719
trying new things realizing when

72
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,439
something may not be working and making

73
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,439
adjustments

74
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,199

75
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,359
connection to the cannabis industry

76
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,399
well brandon goes a long way we can see

77
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,800
that here with

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,680
nutrients with uh t-shirts there's a

79
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
whole lot of that within the industry

80
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,319
engineering spreading is a highly

81
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,319
important position within the industry

82
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,839
as they control the company's image

83
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,280
and ensure that the company and its

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,878
products have proper labeling and

85
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,598
designs that are appealing

86
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,199
to the customers or the target customers

87
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,000
proper branding builds reputation within

88
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,280
the industry

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,878
and a consumer basis all good things

90
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,640
now this could be for the final product

91
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,199
if you're growing as i said cannabis

92
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,439
plants

93
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,479
this could also be with fertilizers but

94
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,800
also with lighting

95
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,479
plant supporting equipment as well so

96
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,439
it's important to keep that in mind keep

97
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,518
that

98
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,719
relevant because the campus industry is

99
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,640
constantly changing

100
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,840
and a good branding person will

101
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,759
recognize those changes

102
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,920
be ahead of those changes make changes

103
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,439
when necessary to keep their company

104
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,439
on the competitive edge
