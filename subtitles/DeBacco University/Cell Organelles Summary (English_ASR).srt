1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
this is going to be a very quick summary

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,318
of the cell organelles

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,519
to kind of give you a quick rundown of

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,080
some of the components

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,879
found in cells you're welcome to look in

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,439
the description

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,200
for the slides you can print those out

8
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,839
or look at them independently or simply

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,600
pause the video if it goes too fast

10
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,960
so looking at kind of what's going on in

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,679
the cell this is just kind of a

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,359
rendition

13
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,039
of some of the components i do want to

14
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,160
point out is kind of this phospholipid

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,080
bilayer being important

16
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,320
kind of that separation factor between

17
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,799
the interior component of the cell

18
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,399
in the exterior component keep in mind

19
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,959
while this does wrap around the entire

20
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,840
cell

21
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,399
these large kind of globs here are cell

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,960
membrane

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,120
proteins some pass all the way through

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,840
some located only on the surface

25
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,679
some located only on the interior so

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,239
just a couple little things that you may

27
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,079
not

28
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,359
recognize on a quick look some of the

29
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,480
other organelles like the

30
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,280
mitochondria the rough and smooth er the

31
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,238
golgi

32
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,558
might be more recognizable now that

33
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:00,640
quick

34
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,878
general summaries i promised i would

35
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,239
provide we have some microvilli which

36
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,679
really aren't shown too much in any of

37
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,159
these slideshows but they're kind of

38
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,840
that

39
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,280
extensive folding of the cell membrane

40
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
allow for cells to have a great

41
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,400
absorption

42
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
capacity they really help increase the

43
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,840
surface area for absorption

44
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,679
that membrane that phospholipid bilayer

45
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,280
that i mentioned acts as a barrier

46
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
allowing cells to regulate what comes in

47
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,920
and out

48
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,118
centrioles are bundles of microtubules

49
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,879
and they're very important for cell

50
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:28,159
division the mitosis process

51
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,399
lysosomes peroxisomes for example are

52
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,079
vesicles that have a bilayer and they're

53
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,759
very important to contain enzymes for

54
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,919
the breakdown process

55
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,680
helping things secreted by the cell

56
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,960
potentially to digest things

57
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
the mitochondria double-walled organelle

58
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,839
organelle produces

59
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,280
most of the cells atp it's adenosine

60
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,640
triphosphate and that's the energy

61
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
currency of the cell

62
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,239
despite many people saying it's just

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,359
simply the powerhouse of the cell

64
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,438
we have ribosomes and they're

65
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,599
specialized protein that translates

66
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,959
messenger rna into polypeptides they're

67
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,359
responsible for the

68
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,599
synthesis or creation of proteins rough

69
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,599
and smooth er endoplasmic reticulums

70
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,118
are responsible again those rough

71
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,919
contain those ribosomes to produce

72
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,479
proteins

73
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,199
in those smooth er more responsible for

74
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,280
synthesizing fatty acids and lipids

75
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,280
golgi apparatus modifies and packages

76
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,759
proteins especially those that are going

77
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,520
to be excreted out of the cell

78
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,359
microtubules and microfilaments they're

79
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
part of the cell cytoskeleton and

80
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,520
they're important

81
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,480
for transportation within the cell also

82
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,959
important for the mitosis process the

83
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,759
nucleus and inside that the nucleolus

84
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,159
those are vital components of containing

85
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,479
the

86
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,280
main dna of the cell and remember that

87
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,238
nucleolus contains a lot of the

88
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,439
rna which is the ribosomal rna this is

89
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,878
kind of a quick run through so you can

90
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,199
kind of make sure that you understand

91
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:51,120
the basic characteristics and functions

92
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,119
of various cell organelles
