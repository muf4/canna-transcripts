1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,679
many growers know to look at the

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,120
trichomes of their cannabis plant to

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,679
determine harvest

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,039
but many wonder what should they be

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,359
actually looking for

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,439
well in this debaco university video i'm

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,359
going to go over some great images

8
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,879
and give you that kind of step-by-step

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,198
guide on what to look for

10
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,599
in your trichomes to determine your peak

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,600
harvest

12
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:29,678
[Music]

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,439
all right let's get into understanding

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,320
visual cues of cannabis trichome

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,480
development to maximize harvest

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,399
so we want to monitor the color change

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,679
so by monitoring the change in color of

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,079
the gland heads

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,640
particularly the grower can evaluate the

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,439
ripeness of the flower pistol at plants

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,320
using a 30x loop or higher is advised

22
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,839
for some

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,480
other form of magnification of the

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,760
trichomes for close visual inspection

25
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,919
now it's important to say that we're

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,198
monitoring the color change so this does

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,000
not mean you just look at them once and

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:59,280
go from there

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,960
it's great if you look at them in the

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,239
early stages when hopefully they'll be a

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
clear coloration

32
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,039
we're going to see they're going to

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,359
progress to this cloudy coloration and

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,359
then

35
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,560
ultimately this amber coloration if they

36
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,920
go a little bit far

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,159
so we're going to see this kind of stage

38
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,118
in progression but that's the general

39
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,320
trend that those trichomes will be going

40
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,000
through

41
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,839
so first off those stages and this kind

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,920
of highlights it here as well

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,439
early to middle flowering resin heads

44
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,359
will be mostly clear

45
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,798
you can see this is a great example of a

46
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,959
mostly clear head right here

47
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,720
this would be another one as well during

48
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,879
the final phases of bloom cycle

49
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,359
the trichomes will transition from a

50
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,920
clear to kind of a cloudy milky white

51
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,400
color

52
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,159
and eventually turn to an amber color so

53
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,000
what's that cloudy milky white look like

54
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,280
we've got a couple here that are in

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,319
focus that are showing that kind of

56
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,040
cloudiness

57
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,679
here's kind of one as well and as you

58
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
can see there's

59
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,280
more but they're kind of out of focus in

60
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,960
the background most seasons growers say

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,960
the time to harvest is when the bulbus

62
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,519
heads which is the top portion here

63
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,199
are cloudy with a few amber ones here

64
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,239
and there about a seventy to thirty

65
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,519
percent mix

66
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,718
one of those amber ones look like where

67
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,078
they're kind of the most obvious

68
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,438
coloration change

69
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,118
uh and we can see this on this

70
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,079
particular image it's not like

71
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,399
everything changes

72
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
at once we see some that are clear some

73
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,800
that are also in the cloudy stage

74
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,079
some are also in the amber stage all in

75
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
the same structure here

76
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,440
this is why it's important to visually

77
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,360
check your plants to see those

78
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,959
transitions that are occurring and see

79
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,560
that change or that shift

80
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,719
in percentages so what do those kind of

81
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,080
clear trichomes kind of look like here

82
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,120
well in the early stage of development

83
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
the clear color can

84
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,599
indicate they're not full of

85
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
cannabinoids and terpenes you can think

86
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,039
of the clear

87
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
color meaning that they are quote empty

88
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,120
now it doesn't mean that they're

89
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,959
completely

90
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,719
empty when they're clear but just kind

91
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,598
of as a visual way to kind of correlate

92
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,359
and remember

93
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,598
clear you can think kind of empty

94
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,599
there's nothing in there so to speak

95
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,439
again not true from a bio uh botanical

96
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,359
standpoint but that kind of gives a

97
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,719
great visual clue of like oh it's clear

98
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,879
it's empty i can see right through it

99
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,560
not looking there's nothing there to see

100
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,239
uh bud should not be harvested at this

101
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
time because at this point they're

102
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,599
basically immature uh

103
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,759
before their kind of peak maturity and

104
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,639
they lack the desired compounds

105
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,000
now this doesn't mean you'll be

106
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,958
harvesting when there might be a couple

107
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,039
that are still clear

108
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,120
but if the vast majority are clear hold

109
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,959
off on the harvest process

110
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,158
now we get to those cloudy trichomes we

111
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,000
kind of see here different

112
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,000
degrees of cloudy when trichomes start

113
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,400
to go from a transparent to kind of

114
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,719
to a translucent transparency this is

115
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,640
the sign that harvest is getting closer

116
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,000
remember transplant is clearly is be

117
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,439
able to clearly see through

118
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,959
translucent we're getting that cloudy

119
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,158
milkiness and then opaque would almost

120
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,360
be that amber color where you're kind of

121
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,519
blocking light

122
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
this cloudy look uh growers can think of

123
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,319
the trichome becoming

124
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,518
full of cannabinoids again that's

125
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:42,719
botanically true

126
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,080
but here we can see that cloudy

127
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,799
appearance that what's giving it the

128
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
cloudiness

129
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,680
we can think of as being the

130
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,519
cannabinoids that are accumulating the

131
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
next step is that opaque kind of amber

132
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,680
color

133
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
and it's thought to give in some cases

134
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
give that energetic high

135
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
you know it may not be fully correlated

136
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,518
with the coloration

137
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,438
to the after effects so what does that

138
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,840
amber coloration kind of look like

139
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,479
well when we get to those amber um like

140
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,479
heads

141
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,840
we're progressing from that cloudiness

142
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,759
uh white collar of cry

143
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,360
of trichomes we'll change the yellow

144
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,039
brown amber color

145
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,120
waiting for some of the trichomes to go

146
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,639
to this coloration is a good sign that

147
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,280
harvest of the cannabinoids can be

148
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,639
maximized so it's okay if a few go to

149
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,679
this amber color let people think oh

150
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,120
it's too late

151
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,879
okay if a few go to that it's time to

152
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
get the vast majority in that milky

153
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,079
white coloration

154
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,680
however if nearly all the trichomes are

155
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,039
this color at harvest this may mean peak

156
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,439
harvest was kind of missed

157
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,879
leading to some degradation of the

158
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,120
internal components

159
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,918
uh sought to give a body high with some

160
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
people

161
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,680
but here we're seeing a couple amber and

162
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,400
that's perfectly fine it's a sign

163
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,879
probably getting right close to that

164
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,599
peak

165
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,560
harvest now that mixed trichomes as i

166
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,240
mentioned they all don't turn

167
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
necessarily in the same day at the same

168
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,280
flip of a switch

169
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,199
since all the trichomes will not change

170
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,638
from cloudy to amber at the same time

171
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,240
can be best to aim for a mixed

172
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,560
coloration to determine

173
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,319
your exact harvest time now the exact

174
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,478
percentage of cloudy and amber

175
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,560
may be impacted by variety state of

176
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,000
development and your kind of ability of

177
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,519
timing as well

178
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,038
so when we have that kind of mix here we

179
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,959
do see some that are kind of clear some

180
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,719
that are cloudy some that are amber

181
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,159
uh we want to kind of make a judgment

182
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
call as far as when

183
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,439
we're going to determine that peak

184
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,560
harvest it's usually when the trichomes

185
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,600
are a mix

186
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
of the colorations uh that i described

187
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,160
here

188
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,520
now kind of that general summary if you

189
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,320
want kind of kind of sectioned out this

190
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,839
picture here

191
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,680
i want that general summary of clear

192
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,359
cloudy or amber heads you can look at

193
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
that kind of general summary image here

194
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,639
as well as going back through some of

195
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
the other images on the slides

196
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
to help you determine when you're

197
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,319
looking at your cannabis plants the

198
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,680
exact

199
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,599
peak of harvest so you're maximizing

200
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,959
the cannabinoids and terpenes produced

201
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
without getting into any

202
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,239
loss due to over ripeness or degradation

203
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,759
there

204
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,918
hopefully this tobacco university video

205
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,479
was helpful in determining your peak

206
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,719
harvest

207
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,719
and maximizing your harvest as well
