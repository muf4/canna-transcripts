00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
all right welcome to this tobacco

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,040
university video

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,639
we're going to be investigating cannabis

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,679
propagation options

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,439
specifically comparing seeds to clones

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,759
giving you some of the advantages

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,119
and disadvantages of both as well as

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,039
looking at a scientific

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,278
research literature paper where they

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,920
compared seeds to clones to see which

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,198
one

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:30,770
they found was the most advantageous so

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:33,920
join us on this video

14
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:35,439
[Music]

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,840
all right well when we're looking at

16
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,280
comparing seeds to clones

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
there are two options for starting

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,439
canvas plant material clones are

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,359
vegetatively propagated to produce

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,000
genetic copies of the original plant

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,640
tissue

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,520
typically taken from a stock or mother

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,399
female plant

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,079
which ensures genetic uniformity seeds

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,239
result in greater potential for

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,600
plant to plant variability so again

27
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,679
which one is better

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
would you want to go with seeds as we

29
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,479
can see

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,799
down here or do you want to go with

31
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,599
clones much more likely what you see

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,840
looking over

33
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,438
in this area well let's take it to the

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,799
scientific literature

35
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,879
and here in this example they compared

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,960
seeds to clones from a 30 plant

37
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,478
comparison and here's the details or

38
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,000
information here you're welcome to find

39
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,359
it is open access

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,519
the average cbg and cbc content and

41
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,239
floral and foliage had no significant

42
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,438
difference

43
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,399
with the p-value greater of 0.05

44
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,279
from plants grown from seeds and from

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,240
cuttings

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,079
the cbc potency from seeds derived from

47
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,359
plants was significantly more variable

48
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,798
and that was at a p value of 0.01

49
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,959
so what does this really mean what's

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,799
this kind of come down to in the end

51
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,719
while seeds may offer some more

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,079
variability if growing in a large number

53
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,759
of plants the average

54
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,279
should make for a little difference in

55
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,920
the end given

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,439
uh for the product given the similar

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,600
growing environments for both

58
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,798
seeds and clones so what's the real

59
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,399
quick summary

60
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,680
ideally given the same environment it

61
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,599
really doesn't make a difference whether

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,520
you start with seeds or clones

63
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,719
so there are pros and cons to each so

64
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,840
you may want to make other

65
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,840
considerations

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,878
for your growing environment and your

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,878
growing style

68
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,079
to determine which one might be a best

69
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,560
fit for you

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
so when we're doing this comparison uh

71
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,280
if you were thinking

72
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,360
seeds what are some of the advantages to

73
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
seeds well seeds can be stored in

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,160
germinated when the time is needed so

75
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
that's a great

76
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,919
advantageous characteristic there for

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,759
growers who

78
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,518
want to kind of store their seeds and

79
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,079
when time's right go through and

80
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,879
germinate those seeds also starting from

81
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,680
seeds offers

82
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,159
many different options and because those

83
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,200
seeds

84
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,439
ship and store easily so your typically

85
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,280
your availability of different types of

86
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,878
strains is much greater if you're

87
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,239
looking at starting with seeds

88
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,280
so what are some of the disadvantages of

89
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,640
starting with seeds well if you're

90
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
considering seeds

91
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,559
you want to consider that there is

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,878
germination equipment required

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,920
also this can result in variable

94
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,439
starting material

95
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,280
if some are slow to germinate some are

96
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,400
quicker to germinate could cause

97
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,400
different stands in your total grow and

98
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
each sea does not equal a plant so

99
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,599
extras are needed to be started so it's

100
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,560
important to keep in mind if you're

101
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,318
looking at

102
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,158
growing four from a certain strain well

103
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,280
you better start with more than four

104
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,120
seeds because

105
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,039
no seed has a 100 guarantee of emergence

106
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,560
now the advantage of clones so those are

107
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,479
closing constant clones what about

108
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
you know what's some advantages to our

109
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,798
clones compared to those seeds we just

110
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,318
talked about

111
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,920
well advantage of clones is you have a

112
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,280
known set of genetics because you're

113
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,839
starting with a

114
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,840
genetic copy of the original plant

115
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,239
you're also starting with a plant not a

116
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,158
seed

117
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,360
not a seed that you're hoping develops a

118
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,280
root that opens emerges

119
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
you're starting with an actual plant

120
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
this can help ensure an even plant

121
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,319
starting time to go through

122
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,519
the cloning process you can kind of

123
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:49,919
guarantee everything's going to be kind

124
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,319
of like

125
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,919
on the same page there so what are some

126
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,119
disadvantages to clones well the

127
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,679
disadvantage to clones

128
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
is that a large population of clones

129
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,400
there needs to be

130
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,318
there's a chance of a single disease

131
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560
could wipe out the entire crop

132
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,839
so because they're alternate copies if a

133
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,920
disease knocks one out it could

134
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,640
potentially knock them all out

135
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,839
clones also lack essential tap roots

136
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,279
that's important consideration while

137
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,878
they can have extensive roots

138
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,319
they typically will lack that tap root

139
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:17,439
because all those roots are coming out

140
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,599
of the stem

141
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,759
and care needs to be taken as of day one

142
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,919
as treating these as actual plants

143
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,840
so that's another you know disadvantage

144
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,159
and compared to seeds where you're going

145
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,519
to have that kind of slow start there

146
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,280
that germination process that little

147
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,439
seedling and then progressing from there

148
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,559
so again these are the pros and cons of

149
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,000
both seeds and clones

150
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,079
it solves the scientific study you

151
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,199
usually get the same result but which

152
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,159
one would you choose

153
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,199
for your grow operation does seeds sound

154
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,439
like a better fit

155
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,680
or do clones sound like a better fit and

156
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,399
investigate more videos on this channel

157
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,918
for details about each method and

158
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,560
whichever one you think works best

159
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:57,680
for your propagation and progression of

160
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,680
growing area
