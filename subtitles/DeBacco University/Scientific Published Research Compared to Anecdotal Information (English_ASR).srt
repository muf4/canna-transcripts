1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,839
okay here we're gonna look at a general

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,939
comparison between scientific published

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,950
research and in external information

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,099
being able to distinguish the difference

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,048
between the two may seem initially very

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,240
obvious but a lot of times people try to

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:16,679
blur the lines between these two so

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,259
let's look at each of these and define

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,759
each to begin first off scientific

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,490
research what defines us it's a

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,980
systematic investigation interpretation

12
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,169
and evaluation of data the results

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,149
obtained from a small group through

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,650
scientific studies are shared and new

15
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,629
information is revealed with respect to

16
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:36,089
diagnosis treatment and reliability of

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,070
applications so scientific research

18
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,879
doesn't mean it's occurred in a sterile

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,770
lab here

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,320
there's other scientific studies that

21
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,329
can occur but they all involve a

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,820
systematic investigation is the key part

23
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,850
here and there evaluating data and that

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,469
can be in small group second be with

25
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,989
different scientists across different

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,239
parts of the world the key part here is

27
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:00,448
that interpretation and evaluation of

28
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,640
data now comparison to that or actually

29
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:04,379
in contrast anecdotal information is

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,450
evidence collected in a casual or

31
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,478
informal manner we like heavily or

32
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,969
entirely on personal testimony so

33
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,829
stories you may hear postings that you

34
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,629
may see things you may read on a blog

35
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,688
things may just read on the Internet

36
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:21,478
this is from someone is posting that's

37
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:23,699
anecdotal information in addition going

38
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,259
back to the scientific research there's

39
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,990
also that collaboration typically a

40
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,719
peer-review process so people are able

41
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:33,390
to compare and relate that are in the

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,618
field to what is found in total

43
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,180
information just one person I'm gonna

44
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:39,709
put something out there and is claiming

45
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,079
it as truth now keep in mind a

46
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:45,209
population size or n of one doesn't

47
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:46,679
support a pattern just because someone's

48
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,209
success with one plant doesn't this

49
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,430
insane mean that's going to work for all

50
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,408
plants silver species can be used to

51
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,790
draw some conclusions and gain ideas for

52
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,500
cannabis chrysanthemums are used

53
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,110
sometimes refer to period development

54
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,239
but there can be unforeseen interactions

55
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:02,700
and complications which is why sides of

56
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,218
the same species is recommended so it's

57
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,990
been good for initial ideas or research

58
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:09,179
but when you're actually coming down to

59
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,699
developing that theory you want to use

60
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,920
the actual test subjects they are the

61
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,530
actual plants and species or

62
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,119
Lavar as close as possible now

63
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,310
scientific study does require use of a

64
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,439
control group this acts as a source of

65
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,360
comparison many conditions are kept

66
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,120
consistent except the one being tested

67
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,170
this is true for scientific studies

68
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,330
procedures conducted as well documented

69
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:33,059
in easily repeatable that's a key part

70
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,010
with scientific studies so you see our

71
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,110
control in our experimental group here

72
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:39,000
the experiment will students test scores

73
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,650
be affected by distracting sounds in the

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,818
testing environment so you have that

75
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,739
control group compared to that

76
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:45,179
experimental group keep in mind we're

77
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,560
not just testing one student and ones

78
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,510
doing there's a collection of students

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,430
and a collection of students and this

80
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:52,859
would kind of be the general sense or

81
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,439
the general idea behind a scientific

82
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,480
study and in a total study and I put

83
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,009
study in quotes here they're often

84
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,750
focused on what changes and does not

85
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:02,579
insure other parameters are kept

86
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,979
consistent they can be a little bit

87
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,630
focused on just one thing we could be

88
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:08,369
looking at different fertilizer rates

89
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:09,959
but not taking into account that some

90
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,659
plants might be more shaded than others

91
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,299
some might be on the edge the soil may

92
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:19,049
not be consistent in this area again all

93
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,340
things worth consideration ant doses are

94
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,859
also common performed on small

95
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,659
population sizes and the keeper ears are

96
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:26,790
typically hard to recreate testing

97
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,949
conditions meaning if someone does test

98
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:31,048
this and prove something or have data to

99
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:33,298
support something typically it's very

100
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:35,609
hard to recreate those conditions so

101
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,859
that can be repeated on that data can be

102
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:40,650
supported and backed up that's typically

103
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,629
not true in total study were definitely

104
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,879
with our scientific studies keeping the

105
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:47,329
procedure well-documented and repeatable

106
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,049
is a mark of a good scientific study

107
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,700
hopefully this gives you that kind of

108
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,620
good comparison between our staying was

109
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,179
a published scientific research is

110
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,739
compared to just standard

111
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,739
run-of-the-mill anecdotal information
