1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,220
okay here I'm gonna go over how to

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:07,830
select the tomato seed or variety that

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:10,080
is best for you now this is not going to

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,460
be a whole list of variety names I'm

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,830
going to teach you how to think and go

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,269
about looking at your operation so you

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,570
can be able to determine the best

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,920
selection for your operation so the

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,010
first thing is what where are you

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,260
growing the first time we consider is

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,480
where you're growing the crop and what

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,130
growth habit you need if you looking at

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,899
an outdoor operation there's a lot of

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,030
options you're looking at being under

15
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:35,460
plastic typically determine source

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,469
emanated treatments will be used this be

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,410
a greenhouse a high teller caterpillar

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,649
tunnel as an example it may be more

19
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:46,558
limited on the size of the plant that

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,230
they can get to second thing to consider

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,089
is what your market is consider your

22
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:51,659
market who are you selling to and what

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,190
do they want

24
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,339
are they looking for the perfect look

25
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:58,589
would be more for hybrids on heirlooms

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,079
people ask for them by name large fruit

27
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,489
for sandwich Tomatoes different colors I

28
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,159
really haven't seen too many deep blues

29
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:07,289
and purples but they offer variety that

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,020
may not be found at some major chain

31
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,340
places so again you got a look at what

32
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,859
your market is because that might

33
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,890
dictate what variety or sway you in a

34
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,438
direction for what we're ready to grow

35
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,150
threaten to consider is well what are

36
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,859
you growing we're looking for a really

37
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,080
season looking for short days to harvest

38
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,849
kind of a quick turnaround time your

39
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,158
main season gonna be your core plantings

40
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:31,019
we're looking for late season growth for

41
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,270
may be considering greater disease

42
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,978
resistance because typically later in

43
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:38,640
the season there's more of that pressure

44
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:40,709
around fourth is to try new varieties

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,349
but always have a standard for

46
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,609
comparison I'll just try everything new

47
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:47,250
if you didn't have that kind of sense of

48
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:49,709
comparison then you might lose it how

49
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,618
effective or how better one variety may

50
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,688
be while experimenting is good you don't

51
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,420
have that control those trials are never

52
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,938
less meanings for me I use the better

53
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,649
boy tomato as my comparison variety to

54
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:05,989
determine whether something is truly

55
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,989
better or worse than something I've used
