1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,359
okay if you've ever taken a forensic

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,298
science class you've probably heard of a

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:09,209
cards exchange principle this is a key

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,219
kind of component of the forensic

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,500
science and what forensic scientists do

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,660
so I figured I should include the quote

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,219
from the professor himself while the

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,769
current exchange principle states that

9
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,829
wherever he steps or ever he touches

10
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,859
wherever he leaves he unconsciously will

11
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:28,320
serve as a salient witness against him

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,720
not only his fingerprints or his foot

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,700
prints but his hair the fibers from his

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,619
clothes the glass that he breaks the

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,179
tool-mark he leaves the paint that he

16
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:39,089
scratches the blood or semen he

17
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,519
deposited or collects all of these and

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,210
more beer mute witness against him this

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,489
is evidence that does not forget this is

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,920
not confused by the excitement of the

21
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:52,849
moment it is not absent because human

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,410
witnesses are it is factual evidence

23
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,629
physical evidence cannot be wrong it

24
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:00,328
cannot be prejudiced itself it cannot be

25
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:03,420
fully absent only human failure to find

26
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:06,090
it study and understand it will dismiss

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,118
its value professor and would look hard

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,890
this is that key principle here for

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,170
forensic scientists are always looking

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,349
for that physical evidence because it

31
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,450
isn't press it is there we just need to

32
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:22,739
find it and it could be in a variety of

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,820
forms so this kind of summarized a the

34
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,319
general summary of that would be

35
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,099
whenever two objects come in contact

36
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,158
with each other

37
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,589
traces of each are exchanged every

38
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,810
contact leaves a trace whether it's a

39
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,090
small whether it was something large

40
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,519
with something very obvious every

41
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,259
contact will leave some sort of trace

42
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,879
this is why it's important when going

43
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,069
and investigating a crime scene is that

44
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,420
to have any of your own material

45
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:47,879
anything that you come in contact with

46
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,189
as the scientist evaluating the scene to

47
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,670
have anything exchanged or kind of

48
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,408
contaminate the crime scene so this fact

49
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,030
is that there is a salient witness that

50
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,609
those investing in the crime scene need

51
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,290
to find and interpret them correctly for

52
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:02,819
the significance so initially might look

53
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,259
at this and you see it's wood some older

54
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,408
wood but we could see there's some

55
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,568
footprints so there might be also some

56
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,790
fibers left behind there could be some

57
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:13,619
fingerprints there could be potential

58
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,378
blood splatter there's a whole different

59
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,550
on a sort of things we want to consider

60
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:21,959
and not dismiss as scientists so every

61
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,670
contact leaves a trace this applies to

62
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,739
both the people involved in the crime

63
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,929
scene originally and also as I said the

64
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,269
investigators as in the investigator you

65
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,030
want to limit your traces left you want

66
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,680
to go into scene undisturbed and be able

67
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,959
to collect the evidence without kind of

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,459
adding any of your own having things

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,810
prepared ahead of time and knowing what

70
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,140
to look for have an idea what to look

71
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,900
for can it be helpful so finding the

72
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:48,179
trace it's not as easy as in your face

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,039
per se type of evidence and may be

74
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,129
limited to investigators abilities and

75
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,679
or access to equipment or technology so

76
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,150
might see this kind of this blink

77
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,459
blackboard here well if you dust it you

78
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,860
could find fingerprints or you know

79
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,920
trace elements with fiber there's a lot

80
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,650
of things in trace elements is very key

81
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,919
and important so it's being mindful of

82
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,079
what to look for in knowing how to look

83
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,628
for it how to find it and how to

84
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,790
eliminate any potential contact that

85
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:20,759
you're adding because remember every

86
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:22,769
contact leaves a trace so it's your your

87
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,689
ability and hopefully you can find that

88
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,840
in a crime scene and that can really be

89
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:32,299
in very important part of the diagnosis

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,299
and evaluation of that crime scene
