1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,080
welcome this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
we are investigating hemp-based cannabis

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,359
for

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,960
fiber and also grain production so

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,199
looking more on a little bit of a large

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,639
or

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,838
industrial scale here hemp production

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,079
so first off when we're looking at

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,399
producing it for grain and

10
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,079
fiber here that can be highly mechanized

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,640
because we are looking at a large scale

12
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,479
here

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,920
with the labor demands per acre similar

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,719
to that of other

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,080
agronomic crops except for wheat control

16
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,799
and harvest operations which require

17
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,679
relatively

18
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,439
more time for hemp so again we can

19
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,079
mechanicalize harvest it can be a large

20
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,439
area

21
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,280
make sure you're having this equipment

22
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,320
so you can be able to process those

23
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,719
large volumes of plant material

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,719
now we're looking at seed sources uh

25
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,840
hemp used for fiber or biofuel or other

26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,600
products grown about

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,879
six to seven feet in height it's gonna

28
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,559
be very tall crop

29
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,079
the goals produce long fibers for

30
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,119
industrial processing

31
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,679
there are some varieties listed here to

32
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,519
have some

33
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,519
validation based on some data for

34
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
nebraska conditions

35
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,118
is the best information that i could

36
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,959
find here so again for looking at

37
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,879
your particular region you might want to

38
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,239
try to see if there's been any research

39
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,879
done on particular

40
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,719
varieties for your particular climate or

41
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,679
growing location

42
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,039
now these hemp varieties just in general

43
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,840
should be certified as having

44
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,439
less than 0.3 percent thc so they're

45
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,439
below that federal limit

46
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,959
grain production tend to favor early

47
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,879
maturing varieties

48
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,719
if you look more for fiber production i

49
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,239
tend to favor later maturing varieties

50
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,039
to allow for an increased cellulose

51
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,239
concentration

52
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,079
in yield as the season progresses male

53
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,759
plants do die off during the season

54
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,078
and manage these female varieties are

55
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,799
generally preferred for industrial hemp

56
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:44,478
production

57
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,200
so again keep that in mind when you're

58
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,840
looking at planting or purchasing

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,680
seed now planting for grain and fire

60
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,118
production the whole planting process in

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,960
general for grain

62
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,840
grain production may be optimized with

63
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:01,759
no more than 150 000 plants per acre

64
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,280
and sowing 20 to 30 pounds of seed

65
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,759
per acre to kind of get to that number

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,840
now for fiber production this is data

67
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,120
based on europe but fiber yields were

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,479
not increased by having

69
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,480
more than 182 000 plants per acre

70
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,598
and this plant density results in better

71
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,679
quality fiber

72
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,359
than with higher planting densities

73
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,439
that's a prime example there where

74
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,959
more plants aren't better per acre you

75
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,919
want to try to maximize

76
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,439
your production within that growing area

77
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,598
now keep in mind that soil temperature

78
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,159
should be around 55 degrees fahrenheit

79
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,799
an emergence is likely to be three to

80
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,120
five days

81
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,239
after spring planting now should be

82
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
about that 55

83
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,319
it's warmer than that probably a little

84
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,039
bit better if it's cooler than that

85
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,719
that may stunt or reduce the rate of

86
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,759
germination that you notice with your

87
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,680
seeds

88
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,799
now harvesting for that grain in fiber

89
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,599
you know how do you go about that

90
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
harvesting

91
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,439
process there for grain as with many uh

92
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,039
any grain crop

93
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,560
really the proper harvesting processing

94
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,598
transport and storage are critical to

95
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
prevent spoilage

96
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,359
and also ensure the highest value for

97
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
the harvested grain

98
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,280
a grain drying facility is needed and

99
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,439
grain drying should be

100
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,598
again within an hour and a half of

101
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,318
harvest so it's always good to have or

102
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,598
make sure

103
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,439
you have the full process for said crop

104
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,199
before you go through and plant it

105
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,598
drying can be done at 140 degrees

106
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,280
fahrenheit with a continuous flow dryer

107
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,959
but grain temperature should not exceed

108
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,598
100 degrees fahrenheit

109
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,719
to avoid the chance of toasting your

110
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,039
crop there

111
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,000
now for fiber harvesting hemp is usually

112
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,079
grown in wider

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
windrow and cut for fiber production at

114
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,760
about eight inches between early bloom

115
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,360
and seed set

116
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,280
when the lower leaves of the female

117
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,239
plant begin to yellow and bailed at

118
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,080
twelve percent

119
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,680
moisture content this is where kind of

120
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,040
have an idea knowing your crop and

121
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,680
checking the fields

122
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,318
to try to hit that kind of peak time to

123
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,280
harvest

124
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,798
if you're looking at fiber now the

125
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,959
market for

126
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,560
grain and fiber just in general again

127
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,280
it's always a little hard to kind of

128
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
gauge

129
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,000
your particular market but it appears at

130
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,319
least using 2019

131
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,919
as an example the supply greatly

132
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,878
exceeded the demand

133
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,280
and hemp fiber and grain stock uh sorry

134
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,039
feed

135
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,799
grain for feedstock prices plunged

136
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,199
during the 2019

137
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,918
season with specific regions getting hit

138
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,400
harder than

139
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,198
others so processors offer growers a

140
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,359
profit share

141
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,960
agreement on the product when sold in

142
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,560
place of outright purchasing of

143
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,799
feedstock at an agreed

144
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,600
price so this again this is always a

145
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,478
little bit of

146
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,720
a kind of a challenge with any sort of

147
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,918
perishable crop or crop in general

148
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,479
looking at demand versus supply

149
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,478
and if supply really kind of becomes

150
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,560
very high demand might go down

151
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,399
so always good to kind of have an idea

152
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,160
what the realistic price will be

153
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,599
what it was in previous years and any

154
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,840
sort of data you can

155
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
you can gain so you can make an educated

156
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,279
decision

157
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
but it is a kind of variable market so

158
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,799
it's not a guaranteed sale there and a

159
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,519
lot of this can come with agreements

160
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,199
growers may establish ahead of time so

161
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,038
again just keep that in mind

162
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,639
that with again any crop you got to keep

163
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,000
an idea of the market

164
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,199
so you can make sure that it's

165
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,199
profitable to use in your growing area
