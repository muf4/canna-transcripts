1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,960
okay here we look at electrons and

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:12,330
neutrons due to the subatomic particles

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:14,609
located in in atom so the energy levels

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,948
of electrons minister with the electrons

5
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:19,769
first energy it's the capacity to cause

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,779
change now energy as we have discussed

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,539
earlier energy and human life we have

8
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,429
our chemical energy here being converted

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,820
into ATP which is the body's energy

10
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,589
currency as part of our metabolism now

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,320
there is heat given off and chemical

12
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,509
waste giving off the energy of those

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,700
electrons so it's a lot of this type of

14
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:42,199
energy which is the capacity to cause

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,200
change the main molecule is ATP

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,370
adenosine triphosphate so there develops

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,690
an electrons well there's two main types

18
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:49,949
there's potential energy which is

19
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,079
probably how you're feeling about right

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,530
now it's stored energy that can be

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,799
released

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,780
Kelly referred to as chemical potential

23
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,669
energy which is the energy stored in the

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,879
bonds of molecules and I think of it's

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,079
like an energy at rest there then they

26
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,780
were a kinetic energy which is the

27
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,478
energy that's being currently used in a

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,250
reaction so those chemical bonds that

29
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,039
just kind of their they've kind of that

30
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,688
potential energy or that stored energy

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,250
then when a reaction is occurring way of

32
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:19,169
that kinetic energies that you see here

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,659
at the cat playing with the toy mouse

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,200
here that's the energy currently being

35
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,670
used in a reaction

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,189
Janene are the energy levels of the

37
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,530
electrons the electron of an atom differ

38
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:33,419
in their amounts of potential energy and

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,849
electron state if potential energy is

40
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,609
called the energy level or its electron

41
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:41,158
shell as we see here the very bottom

42
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:43,709
here is called the ground state as those

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,740
electrons that work their way out their

44
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:48,658
energy level increases these out here we

45
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,489
consider it more of an excited state and

46
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,070
electrons can jump to these different

47
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,199
electron shells through different energy

48
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,539
levels realize the ground state is the

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,670
most basic lowest energy form and

50
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,700
extended States as you work your way up

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,909
the amount of energy increases those

52
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,890
electrons have so arrangement of

53
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,530
electrons in an atom that first energy

54
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,150
level can all a maximum of two electrons

55
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,120
the second third angels can whole

56
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,310
contain

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,250
eight electrons so you see in the middle

58
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,930
here with hydrogen one lonely proton now

59
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,930
just with one proton I have to tell you

60
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,790
this this was hydrogen seeing one proton

61
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,670
indicates that it's hydrogen seeing two

62
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:30,128
protons indicates this is helium seeing

63
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:32,139
here we have 10 protons a little hard to

64
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:34,780
count there would be neon 3 might be a

65
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:36,399
little easier this is lithium we see

66
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,860
those energy levels you have these

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,750
electrons working the way up you'll

68
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,120
notice in all these cases the first

69
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,019
energy level can only hold a maximum of

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,420
2 electrons the second and third angels

71
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:51,310
can hold up to 8 we see that indicated

72
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,409
here when I try to keep this fairly

73
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,128
simple on the smaller atoms but the same

74
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:58,870
holds true as we could work our way up

75
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:01,179
so classification of the elements

76
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,329
families of elements share the same and

77
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,739
named electron configuration we see here

78
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:08,349
so we're looking at Group 1 and group 2

79
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,628
if we were to count all the electrons in

80
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:13,149
the outermost shell here we find that

81
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:15,669
there's only one outermost shell here

82
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,010
there's one outermost shell there's one

83
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:20,798
even all the way down here at francium

84
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:24,519
the outermost shell there's only that

85
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,829
one electron down group to those that

86
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,069
there's two electrons in each one of

87
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:32,430
these outer shells as a result they

88
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:35,500
share similar similar chemical

89
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,879
characteristics so this is why all the

90
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,549
elements in Group one have similar

91
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:43,328
chemical characteristics fill that same

92
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:45,189
one X outside or valence electron that

93
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,959
outside electrons when what's going to

94
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:48,848
do the vast majority of the reactions

95
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,169
that time the outermost area the

96
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:52,509
electrons kind of in the middle here get

97
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,879
stuffed in the ones on the outside doing

98
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:58,840
the reaction group one has one outer one

99
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,608
group two is to the own selections that

100
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,889
I mention move out of the way a little

101
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:04,989
bit a valence electrons here are the

102
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,150
ones on the outside these electrons in

103
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,009
the highest principle energy level and

104
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,370
they determine the chemical reactivity

105
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:13,539
so an important note to make their

106
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,489
elements in a group share the same

107
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:18,098
number of valence electrons as we see

108
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:21,098
here all these have eight valence

109
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:23,269
electrons seven and six five and four

110
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:25,310
and three and two and one

111
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:27,529
however if we look here a little more

112
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,810
closely well be easy to think all one

113
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:32,000
two three four five six seven and eight

114
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,470
there's an error in the air so I'm not

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,019
sure if you can spot that particular

116
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,060
error but if you go through and you look

117
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:40,788
at all of the protons that these

118
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,970
elements have yes all these have one

119
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:47,959
valence electron all these have two if

120
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:50,599
we look up here at element that is

121
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,638
located in this upper corner here does

122
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:54,978
not have eight valence electrons this is

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,629
helium this actually only has two

124
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:58,519
valence electrons so I'd say spot the

125
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,379
error the error is located right here

126
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,839
with helium having only two valence

127
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:07,490
electrons everything else in the noble

128
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:09,109
gas family will have eight now looking

129
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,848
at this kind of complexity of the

130
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,280
periodic table showing the electron

131
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:17,209
shells as we see here most they do get a

132
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:20,809
lot more electrons as we get down to the

133
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:22,818
rows 6 and 7 of the periodic table but

134
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,949
keep in mind all these have the same

135
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:26,689
number of valence electrons except you

136
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,400
can remember helium has two everything

137
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:30,800
else in noble gas family has eight

138
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,359
valence electrons which says remember

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,389
are the electrons located in the

140
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,669
outermost shell

141
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:39,620
now the octet rule atoms tend to gain

142
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:42,829
looser share electrons in order to

143
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,228
acquire a full set of eight valence or

144
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:46,968
outer shell electrons elements with full

145
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:49,310
valence shell are chemically inert

146
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:51,408
they're stable so we want to have eight

147
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,629
here's oxygen typically has one two

148
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:56,000
three four five six well it combines

149
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:57,829
with carbon here it's sharing these two

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,468
so therefore this count as part of

151
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:01,818
oxygen it will have eight those are

152
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:03,199
being shared they can't with carbon

153
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,840
tuned to count all the circles around

154
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,879
carbon will also see eight so think of

155
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:12,109
this octet rule there's an octagon and

156
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:14,180
octopus of our musical octet each atom

157
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,310
is trying to gain or lose or share

158
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,639
electrons in order to maintain that full

159
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:22,120
octet or that eight valence electrons in

160
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,120
its outer shell
