1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
okay here we're looking at population

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,419
distributions if you look at this image

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,330
in the apples in it you can look see how

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,919
they're distributed as you can see it's

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,199
kind of a random and distribution

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,629
however if we look zoom out from this

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,299
one particular image and look at the

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,850
entire field we would see odds are these

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,920
apples be concentrated in one area so

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,929
let's look at population distributions a

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,269
little bit more detail first off we look

12
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:30,118
at a normal population distribution if

13
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:33,238
we look here we see as you increase n or

14
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:36,269
the number of individuals we see a more

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:39,419
defined what we call a bell curve here

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,420
with the odds are or normal average

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,219
being right here in the center again and

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,140
a form you see it increasing we see a

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,920
little bit more they define

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,989
characteristics it 16 to 32 to 64 now

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,929
we're really getting a sense of this

22
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:57,509
normal distribution curve often referred

23
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,128
to as the bell curve what this means is

24
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:04,048
the average will be here in the middle

25
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:05,640
and 34.1% will be one at standard

26
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,618
deviation to the right and thirty-four

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,010
point one on the right to the left I

28
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:13,590
should say and as we get further away we

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,509
see a smaller percentage there's a very

30
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,600
small percentage it'll be way out here

31
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,280
same thing here on the other scale what

32
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,019
I think about this would be height if

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,299
your measure height of a bunch of

34
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,640
individuals of the same age you'd have a

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,590
couple really tall people a couple

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,780
really short people and the vast

37
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,728
majority of people being in that normal

38
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,000
distribution or close to that average

39
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:37,950
height now fish population is

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,150
distributed over a temperature range or

41
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,140
again we're looking at population

42
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,030
distributions

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,299
well how water temperature influences

44
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,460
fishing for small pelagic species

45
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:50,939
bluefin tuna and mahi-mahi or dolphin

46
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,798
are pelagic species in normal conditions

47
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:56,419
you can see most of the fish here are

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,250
about 50 meters down from the surface

49
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,140
but during an El Nino where we have that

50
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,060
increased water temperature these

51
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,368
pelagic species enjoy certain water

52
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,710
temperature as a result they'll be found

53
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:10,199
much deeper in the water column in this

54
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:12,539
case if we're a fisherman here using a

55
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,310
net to catch the fish you can see during

56
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,199
normal conditions nope

57
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,879
well but during El Nino that because

58
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,919
those fish go deeper seeking that

59
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:24,000
similar water temperature then that is

60
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,280
an effective in this example now

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,689
specific population distributions we

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,300
have something here called a random

63
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,849
distribution and occurs when there is no

64
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,570
competition and agonism or tendency to

65
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,459
aggregate which tends to be rare so this

66
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,759
random distribution we could look at the

67
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,770
hillside here the presence of conifer

68
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,560
trees is random the presence of maple

69
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,300
trees is random oak trees is random and

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,670
it kind of looks like this is kind of

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,469
like you took a bunch of marbles and

72
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:55,859
just kind of threw them out over any

73
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:58,229
area it's a random distribution here we

74
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,209
have a uniform distribution which

75
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:02,669
results from intense competition or

76
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,650
antagonism between individuals and tends

77
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:07,099
to be rarely found you can see here with

78
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,920
the Penguins pretty much all evenly just

79
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:13,169
the distribution is very evenly spaced

80
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,518
kind of like students in the class you

81
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,809
can see they're all kind of like facing

82
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,719
here like we're viewing from the teacher

83
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,030
standpoint however we don't see it we

84
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,669
typically seen classes it's talking or

85
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,340
on their phones and we see kind of most

86
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:29,578
of the payments here nicely facing the

87
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,409
camera here are paying attention another

88
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,989
population distribution would what we

89
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:35,639
call clumping this is the most common

90
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,340
distribution because environmental

91
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,289
conditions are seldom uniform

92
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,329
reproductive patterns favorite clumping

93
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:44,340
and anal behavior patterns often lead to

94
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,110
congregation we see that here there's

95
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,569
kind of like little clumps of these

96
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,820
particular organisms the Optima t4a

97
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,340
population growth in survival is often

98
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:56,340
intermediate one under crowding can be

99
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,810
as harmful as overcrowding so we want to

100
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,329
take this into consideration we're

101
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,650
looking at populations too we often

102
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,349
think of the negatives being too many

103
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,930
organisms in one area in certain cases

104
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:10,219
under crowding can also be harmful or

105
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,750
just too few individuals in an area

106
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:14,099
looking at population dispersal looking

107
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,918
at the spread of the Africanized may

108
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:19,649
beans we see them evident here in texas

109
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,750
and spreading out early so the question

110
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,489
is how can you explain their success in

111
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,129
expanding their territory these

112
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,660
Africanized honeybees looking

113
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:29,990
specifically our population to

114
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,030
versal why are they originally brought

115
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,129
to Brazil arre Tricia's brought the

116
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:38,219
Africanized honeybees to Brazil 1950s

117
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:40,439
attempt to improve productivity of the

118
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,390
Brazilian bees so these African

119
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,639
honeybees were brought to Brazil we see

120
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,289
they've expanded well beyond that they

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,329
originally brought with good intentions

122
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,340
however how can you explain the success

123
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,919
of Experion in territory we see them

124
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,810
starting to move into Mexico and Texas

125
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,410
and southern regions of the United

126
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,060
States

127
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,100
well Africanized honeybees produced more

128
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,350
offspring they defend their nests much

129
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,510
more fiercely in greater numbers and are

130
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,430
more likely to abandon their nests when

131
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,680
threatened by predators or adverse

132
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,980
environmental conditions so they're just

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,829
a couple of the ways to explain how

134
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,410
these Africanized honeybees be able to

135
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:19,769
vastly increase their population

136
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,990
dispersal the population growth rates

137
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:23,879
the increase in population during the

138
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,920
period of time expressed as a percentage

139
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,579
of the population at the start of that

140
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,290
period

141
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,169
it reflects the number of births and

142
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,970
deaths during a period of time now you

143
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,860
can see here the average population

144
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,530
growth notice here Germany and Japan

145
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,410
they are below zero they actually have

146
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:43,409
negative population growth rates which

147
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,240
means that they are ever a year that

148
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,540
goes by their population is decreasing

149
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,090
so it's possible population growth to be

150
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,790
negative here something want to consider

151
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:56,009
well look at the average and if things

152
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,379
are well above or below that average how

153
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:00,418
that may influence the world's

154
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:04,850
population that may influence the

155
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:04,849
resources that we use on a global scale
