1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,669
in this short video I'm going to cover

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:07,648
three specialized plant epidermal cells

3
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:10,379
remember epidermal cells referring to on

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,559
the exterior or outside portion of the

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,240
plant it'll help it for protection each

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:17,789
of these cells have very specialized

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,649
functions the first specialized

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,320
epidermal cell are called guard cells

9
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:24,358
these are paired cells that protect the

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,920
open and called the stomata so as we saw

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,019
in a previous video we saw the stomata

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,689
opening and closing well that's because

13
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,879
guard cells help regulate the passage of

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,549
oxygen carbon dioxide and water vapor

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,410
across the epidermis remembered while

16
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:39,899
these are holes technically they're

17
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,238
pores because they're regulated these

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,359
openings called stomata allow the plant

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:49,109
to take up carbon dioxide and release

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:51,750
oxygen and water vapor the column the

21
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,909
colorized scanning electron micrograph

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,340
shows the close to amount of a dicot in

23
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:58,919
each dama is flanked by two guard cells

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,510
when they swell it helps it close and

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,030
they're allowed to open and this is

26
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:05,099
what's allowing these pores to be opened

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,079
the guard cells sit within the layer of

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,048
the epidermis you could see them right

29
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,329
here so are close to mount of here to

30
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,950
seal up the area here's the open stomata

31
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:17,459
you can see the guard cells located

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,129
right here when they swell up indicating

33
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,829
there's a lot of water they begin to

34
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:24,209
open and that is what allows things to

35
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,609
go through the air in the water vapor

36
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:30,839
and when the plant wants to condense or

37
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:33,060
conserve water they will close up so

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,799
those are the guard cells in addition to

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,200
guard cells another specialized

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,240
epidermal cells called trichomes these

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,920
are the outgrowth of the epidermis that

42
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,688
occur on the chute and give it the fuzzy

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,549
appearance tried to show some good

44
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,739
images here they play a role in

45
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,470
insulating and effect heat and water

46
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,118
balance so they can help reduce water

47
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:53,728
loss because we're just kind of creating

48
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,799
this more of a furry like fuzzy surface

49
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:57,899
and this is what they look like in a

50
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,880
kind of zoomed in look and they are

51
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,759
white and they are little protrusions

52
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,560
there these are two plants that have a

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,030
lot of trichomes and they kind of stand

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,090
out and very distinctive here and

55
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,128
they're outgrowth from the epidermis the

56
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,420
last type is called a root hairs so last

57
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:13,889
we talked about it we talked about the

58
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,318
mycorrhizae which is a fungus

59
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,909
associate with roots also root here's

60
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,429
these are small extensions that come

61
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,259
from the central root and they occur

62
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,260
below ground in the hill keep the root

63
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,449
in direct contact with soil particles

64
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,129
who hairs play an important role in

65
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,500
reabsorption by increasing the surface

66
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,969
area of the root now from the root we

67
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,979
can have mycorrhizae that binds to that

68
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,889
which is a beneficial symbiotic fungus

69
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:40,169
and that can further enhance water and

70
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,059
nutrient absorption now a short

71
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:45,829
description of the three specialized

72
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,830
epidermal cells in plants
