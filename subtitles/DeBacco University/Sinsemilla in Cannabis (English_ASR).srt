1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,559
okay in the pictures here we see two

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,509
female flowers for Disney cannabis

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,149
what's unique about these flowers is

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,740
that there's no seeds sinsemilla

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,599
is what's called in cannabis when you

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,170
produce a flower that does not produce

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,868
any seeds that sinsemilla is pronounced

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,600
Erickson sawmill a is a female flower

9
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,879
that has not been pollinated this is the

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,368
most potent part of the plant or the

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:29,009
highest cannabinoid production and CBD

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,439
will be produced the goal is to have the

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,719
plant produce all of its energy and

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,509
reserves inter producing cannabinoids

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,058
and not producing seeds through this

16
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,859
process now why not pollinate a flower

17
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,738
will the lack of pollination signals in

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,780
the plant to produce more resin attempts

19
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,699
to increase the odds of capturing pollen

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,350
that may be in the air so it's the

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,390
plant's response to not being pollinated

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,920
initially it's trying to go through and

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,289
increasing the odds that it couldn't get

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,969
pollinated this same plant stressor also

25
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,359
increases the production of cannabinoids

26
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,629
which are present in the in the

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,189
structures we see here called trichomes

28
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:08,489
the pollen if pollen does reach the

29
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:11,399
female flower the energy will be on by

30
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:13,469
the plant allocated to producing seeds

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,420
and this will reduce the amount of

32
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,099
cannabinoids produced and this is in

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,560
part why it's so important to identify

34
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,719
male flowers early on so that you're not

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,030
getting this potential for pollination

36
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,140
which will vastly reduce your

37
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,140
cannabinoid production
