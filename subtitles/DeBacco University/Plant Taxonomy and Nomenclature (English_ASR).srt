1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
on this debaco University video I'm

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,179
going to go over plant taxonomy in

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:09,300
nomenclature where we'll be able to

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:11,519
compare cultivar and variety which maybe

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,440
uses interchangeable terms and will give

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,539
you an idea of when each should be

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,539
utilized in the correct situation

8
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:25,679
[Music]

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,539
all right so looking at nomenclature

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,278
codes and resources so the international

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,039
codes that set the rules for plant

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,859
nomenclature these are the authoritative

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,200
but also the technical which may not

14
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,179
make them the easiest to read as most

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,739
Growers would like when it comes to

16
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,659
Discerning the difference of some of

17
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,519
these key terms I'm going to try to

18
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,439
break that down for you here

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,120
so just one example here the

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,579
international code for nomenclature for

21
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,038
algae fungi and plants this is one of

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,780
the authorities here the abbreviation

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,698
this is the ICN if you hear that

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,039
referred to it serves the needs of

25
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,718
Science by setting precise rules for the

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,120
application of scientific names to

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,400
taxonomic groups of algae fungi in

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,618
plants and the link is provided here if

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,340
you want to look at the full extent of

30
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,959
this

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,939
then we also have the international code

32
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,658
for nomenclature for cultivated plants

33
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,519
so this is the icncp this serves the

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,040
applied disciplines of horticulture

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,658
Agriculture and Forestry by setting

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,580
rules for the naming of cultivated

37
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,799
plants so you can see here there's

38
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,798
already some you know different areas to

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,540
go through to get the proper and correct

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,479
scientific naming

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,880
an additional resource provided here

42
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,859
where we're looking at plant names is a

43
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,359
guide to Botanical nomenclatures a third

44
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:44,219
edition and also the code decoded

45
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,780
example here again a link provided just

46
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,359
other things you can take a look at if

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,219
you really want to know the true or look

48
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,840
at all the details of the rules my goal

49
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,599
is here to provide you hopefully with an

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,520
overview it's easy to understand

51
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,640
so parts of a name so we're looking at

52
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,618
breaking down just a name in general we

53
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,799
have the genus name which should be

54
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,560
written in italics with the first letter

55
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,700
capitalized then we have these specific

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,878
epithet which should be written in

57
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:14,459
italics in lower case and then we get on

58
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,259
to the species name which is comprised

59
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,479
of the genus name followed by the

60
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,340
specific epithet and it should be

61
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,500
written in italics as well with the

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,539
first letter of the genus capitalized a

63
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,180
species name is comprised of the genus

64
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,759
name and the specific epithet is also

65
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,900
known as a binomial so this is where you

66
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,539
get into the term you may have heard

67
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,459
binomial nomenclature getting into the

68
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,039
proper naming try to provide you with

69
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,539
some visuals here to give you an idea of

70
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,598
how this actually looks and how it's

71
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,639
kind of like broken down as well

72
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,818
so popular naming of plants we've got

73
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,500
the cultivar versus the variety uh this

74
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:50,878
debate often goes on and people use them

75
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,900
interchangeably when really they

76
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,340
shouldn't be

77
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,439
they both appear as part of the

78
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,598
scientific name of a plant and they

79
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,180
always follow the genus or species name

80
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,939
however a cultivar typically means a

81
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,400
cultivated variety thus that cultivar is

82
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,739
selected and cultivated by humans most

83
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,200
cultivators are cultivars are developed

84
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,680
by plant breeders and can also be called

85
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,419
hybrids varieties A variation within a

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,680
plant species that develops naturally in

87
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,500
the environment and doesn't require

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,719
human intervention so variety is more

89
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,120
natural occurrence cultivar is more with

90
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,459
human intervention it's kind of your key

91
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,200
distinguishing Factor right there

92
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,420
to break it apart a little easier here

93
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,579
again how to distinguish a cultivar from

94
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,818
a variety how it's developed basically

95
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,200
you look at you know how did that

96
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:39,359
originate how that Plan originate was it

97
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,060
developed naturally if so it'd be a

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,500
variety uh was human intervention

99
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,719
applied was it developed through human

100
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,459
Interventional then be a cultivar so we

101
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,259
could see here the cultivar variety you

102
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,080
kind of kind of get your land race your

103
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,298
heirlooms moving on you know closer to

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,760
your variety where your cultivars can be

105
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,159
derived from hybrids are also derived

106
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,798
from isolated and reproduced selection

107
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,658
and also potential isolated and

108
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,219
reproduced mutation as well getting with

109
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:07,798
that human intervention on this side

110
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,239
more of the naturally occurring here on

111
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,040
the left side

112
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,239
so how to distinguish them you know how

113
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,699
to distinguishing the comparison of the

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,620
two seeds planted from a variety tend to

115
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,139
grow true to type meaning The Offspring

116
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,660
retains the pre the parents uh plant's

117
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,699
unique characteristics seeds planted

118
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,439
from a cultivar will most likely not be

119
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,478
true to type those are the seeds you're

120
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,918
planting um after because it's that

121
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,180
human intervention it's that selection

122
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,439
for through the breeding process

123
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,019
potentially through the creation of

124
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,459
hybrids you may get that not true from

125
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,500
type

126
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,659
so variety is a name written in lower

127
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,879
case and italicized and a cultivar name

128
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,919
is written unitalicized inside single

129
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,439
quotes with the first letter of each

130
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,240
word word capitalized we can see that

131
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,219
right here is the cultivar as mentioned

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,560
with this the genus in the specific

133
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,300
epithet mentioned earlier defines the

134
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,100
species and that's part of a binomial

135
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,319
nomenclature

136
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,000
so writing a variety well when writing a

137
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,399
variety name within a plant's full

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,918
scientific name this species name comes

139
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,679
first followed by the abbreviation VAR

140
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,959
period followed by the variety name all

141
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,540
and lowercase and italicized we can see

142
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,159
here's the variety abbreviation and then

143
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,740
we can see that depicted right here

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,180
another example on this sign provided

145
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,879
here as well

146
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,038
so plant variety and breeding rights so

147
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,079
a plant variety is a legal term coined

148
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,939
by the international Union for the

149
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,579
protection of new varieties of plants

150
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:32,100
the upov that recognizes certain

151
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,079
cultivars as official plant varieties in

152
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,780
order to Grant the creator of the

153
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,758
cultivar legal protection sadly it all

154
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,799
comes back to money in some cases this

155
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,060
has a different meaning than variety on

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,038
its own and that's where part of the

157
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,199
confusion comes in this practice is

158
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,478
commonly referred to as plant breeders

159
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,520
rights and the term plant variety

160
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,139
describes a legally protected cultivar

161
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,779
that should not be confused with the

162
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,360
taxonomic rank term variety even though

163
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,698
as you can see it's pretty easy to make

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,500
that confusion if you're not well versed

165
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,620
in the background

166
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,600
so a cultivar species looking here a

167
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,220
plant cultivar refers to a variation

168
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,680
within a plant species that has been

169
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,660
developed by a human hold a culturalist

170
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,939
through controlled plant breeding as

171
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,740
opposed to occurring naturally as a

172
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:21,120
result the term cultivar is a result of

173
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,639
the blending of cultivated variety when

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,740
the writing the complete scientific name

175
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,660
of the plant cultivar the cultivar name

176
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,780
comes after the name of the genus and

177
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,220
species and the cult of our name is

178
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:34,019
unitalicized set off in single quotation

179
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,900
marks in the first letter of each word

180
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,399
is capitalized as we can see here and we

181
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,899
can also see that here following the

182
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,418
proper rules for that scientific name

183
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:45,000
including that cultivar in those single

184
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:46,859
quotes there ideally this Homer Edition

185
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,579
did not show that these genus and

186
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,560
specific epithet should be in italics

187
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,779
so how do you go about establishing a

188
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,459
new uh cultivar so to create a new

189
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,559
cultivar Growers crossbreed parent

190
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,299
plants that each have desirable

191
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,000
characteristics in the hopes that their

192
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,340
offspring will inherit those traits once

193
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,839
ago ends up with a new cultivar with the

194
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:08,519
desired traits the government must then

195
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,439
ensure future generations of that

196
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,959
cultivar name maintain those

197
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,699
distinguished characteristics the grower

198
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,500
has to use either controlled pollination

199
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,680
or various methods of asexual

200
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,819
propagation for example plant cloning

201
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,379
and that could be an example of grafting

202
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,419
tissue culture as well as taking a

203
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,759
cutting if the grower tries to propagate

204
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,620
the Culver by seed The Offspring plant

205
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,139
will most likely not be identical to the

206
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,060
parent plant losing that idea of that

207
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,680
uniqueness or those desirable

208
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,418
characteristics and distinguishable

209
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,400
characteristics of that particular

210
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:40,500
cultivar

211
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,638
so we get to plant hybrids we'll win two

212
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,978
plant cultivars undergo

213
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,199
cross-pollination the seed of those two

214
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:48,060
plants produced grows essentially a

215
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,919
hybrid plant your takes you have

216
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,538
repeated inbreeding repeated inbreeding

217
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,459
you get an inbreeded line and inbreeded

218
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,139
line to breed those together and you get

219
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,120
a hybrid line

220
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,220
very homozygous and heterozygous there

221
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,340
you could have that you know hybrid is

222
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,780
ideally the best of uh both parents or

223
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,239
at least ideally

224
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,918
so natural plant hybrids they do exist

225
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,720
when two different plant species grow

226
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,939
near each other the wind or pollinating

227
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,099
insect can cross-pollinate those plants

228
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:15,660
this produces a hybrid seed that falls

229
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:18,360
to the ground and grows into a new

230
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,160
hybrid plant this is part of the kind of

231
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,199
the genetic mutation in those kind of

232
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,539
increased in genetic variation of

233
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,240
certain plants to help increase the odds

234
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:29,459
of survival mutations aren't necessarily

235
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,379
always a bad thing but in certain cases

236
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,819
it's really the environment that

237
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,060
determines whether that special

238
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,680
difference is advantageous or not for

239
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,019
that individual

240
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,000
so human generated plant hybrids well

241
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,439
human plant breeders create most hybrid

242
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,179
plants in order to grow a plant with

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,459
positive traits from both parents as

244
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:49,919
said before even though hybrid seeds can

245
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,659
be made randomly in nature hybrid seeds

246
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,579
that you purchase are deliberately

247
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:56,278
produced by humans and kind of get into

248
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,839
that hopefully improved cultivar related

249
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:59,278
performance

250
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,620
I want to hear the term with certain

251
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,179
industries the term strain strains are

252
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,459
often seen as inherent artificial

253
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:08,219
Concepts characterized by a specific

254
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,958
intent for genetic isolation this is

255
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,180
most easily observed in microbiology

256
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,579
particularly bacterial strains are

257
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,199
derived from a single cell colony and

258
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,600
are typically limited by the physical

259
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,240
constraints of the petri dish strains

260
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:25,139
are also commonly used and referred to

261
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,539
within virology botany with um with

262
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:30,299
rodents use in experimental studies to

263
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,860
not advise to apply the term strain if

264
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,939
you're looking at growing any type of

265
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,039
plants despite them being plastered on

266
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,959
certain varieties they're called strains

267
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,360
have a certain strain really that's best

268
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,979
reserved for the microbiology world and

269
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,500
hopefully now you understand how to use

270
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,778
cultivar and variety a little bit better

271
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,000
and kind of exactly the distinguishing

272
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:53,539
difference and hybrid between those

273
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,539
terms
