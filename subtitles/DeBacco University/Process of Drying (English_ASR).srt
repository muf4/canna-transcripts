1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,129
I'm gonna go over the process of trying

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,528
cannabis now when we think about drying

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:09,809
there a hairdryer we think about putting

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:11,250
clothes out in the line to dry some

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:13,289
methods are quicker so methods are

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,000
slower and there's advantages and

7
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,629
disadvantages to both so I'll try to

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,980
present the proper way to try cannabis

9
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:21,989
so the importance of drying first off

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,329
regardless of what process you choose so

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:26,399
it's this is a drying is very critical

12
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,439
that it can make or break the end

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,118
product that you have freshly harvested

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,700
material will have little potency n--

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,320
will burn very poorly so this speaks to

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,329
the importance of having a drying

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,780
process the goal of the drying process

18
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,270
is to have an even slow progression to

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,320
allow a high-quality end product to be

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,359
sold our use now this drying process

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,280
fresh green buds that are full of

22
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,439
moisture and that would cause them to

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,980
have a potentially diluted kind of like

24
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,108
poor taste and to burn unevenly so if

25
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:59,849
you're just a pic of blood right off of

26
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:01,679
right off the plant and smoke it or add

27
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,600
heat to it it's not gonna it's gonna

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,948
have that high moisture content you're

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,930
not gonna get really the potency there

30
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:09,209
and it kind of greenish taste it's

31
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,700
usually referred to as I'll proper

32
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,859
drying will remove about 75% of moisture

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,450
which will concentrate the taste on one

34
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,299
smoked and also concentrate those

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:22,290
cannabinoids this drying process that

36
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,970
takes a slow time for plants over a week

37
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,930
is better than trying to speed dry the

38
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,578
material so that 75% that's lost we

39
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,118
don't want that to curl in one day we

40
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:35,039
might have a slow dry down process to is

41
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,978
that will produce a higher quality end

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,509
product a lot of growers believe in

43
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,879
hanging the plants cutting them down and

44
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,549
hanging them hanging the plants upside

45
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,310
down is a an OK way to dry them that's

46
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,890
fine but it will not help drain the

47
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,030
cannabinoids to the flowers so this is a

48
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,500
good way to dry them but don't think

49
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,149
it's going to help increase the

50
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,069
cannabinoids by having them flow down to

51
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,560
the buzz sound with the force of gravity

52
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,879
that's an old myth Canadians are fixed

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,820
in the plant while that move based on

54
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,140
the position during the drying process

55
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:05,250
so again hanging off sit down great way

56
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,489
to dry them but don't think it's gonna

57
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,628
concentrate cannabinoids in any way

58
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:11,789
faster speed running is not advised

59
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,889
quick drying result in the end product

60
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:14,239
that burns with a harsh smoke that kind

61
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,539
of

62
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,040
kind of tastes as I had said often snot

63
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:21,469
the goal in seeking to produce a high

64
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,599
quality end product Heath it's often

65
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:25,509
added will reduce the drying time to

66
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,430
only a few hours which may sound great

67
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:30,620
but if you dry it with too much heat

68
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,080
about over 200 degrees Fahrenheit they

69
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,480
can degrade cannabinoids often they'll

70
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,980
need to be dried and then maybe read

71
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:38,389
right after they're allowed to kind of

72
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:42,049
go through a sweating process but

73
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:43,549
container so that can just sweating

74
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,660
could potentially cause some moisture to

75
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,730
build-up could cause some mold to

76
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:48,740
develop some other growth will actually

77
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:50,539
dice up the buds and cut them up but

78
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,360
this is not really a preferred method

79
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:56,090
since most end-users want to see and

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,400
inspect the full intact bud that's a

81
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,009
sign of higher quality dry time should

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,240
be about five to seven plus days or so

83
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:06,530
to allow for uniform drying with minimal

84
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,070
cannabinoid breakdown

85
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:13,340
it's desiccation process at drying slow

86
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:15,139
processes advised large leaves from

87
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,960
plants can be removed harvest helping

88
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:19,849
even in more dry this drying process can

89
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,280
think of kind of like aging wine and

90
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,169
barrels here slower and longer is

91
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,539
typically beard is better and producing

92
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:29,859
the higher end product same here can be

93
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,859
applied to cannabis
