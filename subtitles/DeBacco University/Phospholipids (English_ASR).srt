1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,250
okay here we're looking at the last sub

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,429
category of lipids called phospholipids

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,888
this is what one individual phospholipid

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,320
looks like and this is a boat call a

5
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,298
phospholipid bilayer would receive two

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,730
layers of these phospholipids coming

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:20,039
together very important for cell

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,350
membranes and keep in mind there's a

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,060
hydrophobic tail that's the lipid

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,250
portion that's kind of the fat portion

11
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:29,608
to see here they can be saturated or

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,589
unsaturated in a hydrophilic head group

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,940
which is the phosphate group we see a

14
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,679
charge here

15
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,049
it's a phosphate group here and that's

16
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,049
hydrophilic likes water in the middle

17
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:42,509
here at dislikes water so phospholipid

18
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,308
in general is a modified fat to one of

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,649
the three fatty acids is replaced by a

20
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:49,259
phosphate in a small polar functional

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,359
group so this polar portion is what

22
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,820
makes it hydrophilic meaning it likes

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,640
water in comparison to the lipid portion

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,679
here the hydrophobic tails in water

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,340
phospholipids aggregate to form a lipid

26
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,140
bilayer as we saw in the previous image

27
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,109
composed of a hydrophilic head in two

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,019
hydrophobic tails so wall is highlighted

29
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,569
here in nice colors and I shaped realize

30
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,329
that there is this phosphate group and

31
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:17,609
then two fatty acids and recognize the

32
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,679
saturated one whose as all single bonds

33
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:22,200
saturated with hydrogen's keep in mind

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,189
in an unsaturated one here there is a

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,609
single double bond here but it still

36
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:31,139
classifies it as unsaturated and this

37
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:32,310
would be the assists form here because

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,739
they built these four men on the same

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,228
side continuing on with our

40
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,390
phospholipids it's a major component in

41
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:41,688
cell membranes as I said they form a

42
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,399
lipid bilayer which is semi permeable

43
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:46,408
what it means to be semi permeable as we

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,189
look here we zoom in on this green area

45
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,500
and we look at one phospholipid here

46
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:54,478
this semipermeable cell membrane it's

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,849
generated in cells means that only

48
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,218
certain molecules are able to diffuse

49
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:02,158
across it so as we see here for example

50
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:04,890
a semipermeable membrane we see some

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,159
holes here allowing the small molecules

52
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,259
to go through but not the larger ones so

53
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,939
as a result has a lot of proteins here

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,739
aligned for signaling the line for

55
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,780
things to come in and out

56
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,840
but what's the main kind of barrier here

57
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,620
is this phospholipid bilayer component

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,569
of the cell

59
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,550
if you mine doesn't prevent anything

60
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,180
from getting through but it is what we

61
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,620
call semi permeable there's only certain

62
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,560
molecules can diffuse across through it

63
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,310
others need these protein carriers and

64
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,810
active transport to move them across

65
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,240
lastly are phospholipids our final

66
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,580
function encoding cellular barriers also

67
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,140
aid in movement of vitamins nutrients

68
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,960
and fat containing molecules throughout

69
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:48,269
the body the the you see these round

70
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,969
portions here the liposomal if you

71
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,250
notice we have our hydrophilic heads on

72
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:56,189
the outside forming a bilayer and also

73
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,400
forming a pocket on the inside the

74
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,829
micelle here is only one layer and we

75
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,140
see all the hydrophobic tails pointed on

76
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,780
the inside these are both forming these

77
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,179
kind of spherical shapes what we

78
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,789
commonly see in cells is the bilayer

79
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,849
sheet and this is that I layer here

80
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:16,949
that's of being semi permeable only

81
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:20,159
allowing certain things into and out of

82
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:21,929
the cell we need protein carriers as

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,490
will learn about later to help transport

84
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,830
things but this bilayer acts as a

85
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,050
wonderful semi permeable barrier to the

86
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,480
cells allowing them to control and

87
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:34,580
regulate many of the things coming both

88
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,579
into and also leading the cell
