00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,439
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,679
video

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,679
here looking at glass as evidence

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,519
involved with crime scenes

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,039
so first off will what is glass we need

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,880
to define what that is and

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,798
while this glass may not have a specific

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,560
melting point it will soften

9
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,919
over a temperature range and that can be

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,839
important where arson

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,279
or high heat might be involved with a

12
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,600
particular crime scene

13
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,278
glass is also a uniform amorphous solid

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
which means it has irregular atomic

15
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,000
structure

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,198
which causes it to break a variety of

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,320
fraction patterns

18
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,800
which can vary based on impact

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,640
force of impact angle of impact and also

20
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,039
the type of glass

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,558
so how is glass used in forensic science

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,079
well small fragments can be used as

23
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:42,718
trace evidence to link objects and

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,799
people through

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,800
through crime scene reconstruction

26
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,359
process and that can be involved with

27
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,599
directly

28
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,558
for example where a bullet is piercing a

29
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
piece of glass

30
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,399
or sometimes even accidental or

31
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,198
something might be knocked over

32
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,879
and broken and those trace elements

33
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,000
might be picked up

34
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,920
by the person at the scene and

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,359
found later by an investigator on their

36
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,159
clothing or potentially within their

37
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,359
shoes

38
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,880
this is often present in like places

39
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,879
that are robs or

40
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,798
burglaries or hit and run accidents as

41
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,839
well so it's important to keep in mind

42
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,799
of this glass evidence now in the actual

43
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,439
crime scene work

44
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,960
may it be used well automobile accidents

45
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,158
where a broken headlight or even

46
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,399
windshield glass

47
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,600
could be fractured or damaged a store

48
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,159
break in as i mentioned

49
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,759
where shards of window glass with fibers

50
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,240
or blood on them can also help

51
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,040
link a person to a scene shots fired

52
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,798
into a window

53
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,479
the sequence into actual direction of

54
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,159
the bullets can often be determined by

55
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,920
examining the glass

56
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,359
these small minute particles of glass

57
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,759
may be transferred to a subject's

58
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,359
shoes or clothing and can provide a

59
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
source of trace evidence

60
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,560
linking the suspect to the actual crime

61
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,200
scene

62
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,478
this is again helpful but keep in mind

63
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,600
that we really have to be looking for

64
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,799
these very small

65
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:01,118
small pieces these trace evidence

66
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,759
when we're collecting a glass as

67
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,438
investigators it's important we do so

68
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,879
in a way that tries to collect as many

69
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,799
samples as possible but it's also

70
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,878
protective to you

71
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,840
we also want to in that process want to

72
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,079
collect these

73
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
standard reference glass should be taken

74
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,520
from the crime scene we're looking about

75
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,080
an

76
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,840
inch um square i want to package it in a

77
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,640
solid container to prevent breakage

78
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
and indicate interior and exterior

79
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,598
surfaces

80
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,959
if possible the presence of dirt paint

81
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,439
grease or putty may help

82
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
identify the inside and outside surfaces

83
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,759
if they're known

84
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,039
so if you're looking at a piece of glass

85
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,000
if maybe a window and you know where the

86
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,799
outside is

87
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,560
make note of what side that is on the

88
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,719
glass that you're collecting

89
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,878
i want to preserve garments with glass

90
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,000
on it that can include shoes pants

91
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,439
even shorts anything that may have that

92
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,199
potential for carrying that trace

93
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,359
evidence all broken glass must be

94
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,839
recovered and submitted to analysis

95
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
when direction of impact is desired in

96
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,158
as many pieces

97
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:01,519
as possible to help make that process as

98
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,359
simplified as can be now when we get

99
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,560
these pieces of glass evidence well when

100
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,319
the suspect

101
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,920
and crime scene fragments are assembled

102
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:08,719
and physically fit together and this can

103
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,878
be a very

104
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,519
time consuming process comparison of

105
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,759
this type uh do require the piecing of

106
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,519
these irregularities in the broken glass

107
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,919
as well as matching all these

108
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,519
and irregularities and striations on the

109
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,359
broken surfaces

110
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,959
the possibility that two pieces of glass

111
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,319
originating from different sources will

112
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,878
fit together exactly

113
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,919
is unlikely and this is a way to exclude

114
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,000
other sources from

115
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,518
physical consideration unfortunately

116
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,280
most glass evidence is either too

117
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,519
fragmented or too minute to permit

118
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,719
a comparison of this type that's part of

119
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,000
the reason why it's so important to try

120
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,239
to collect as many

121
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,598
pieces as possible it gets a little more

122
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,000
confusing if you have

123
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,639
a window that's broken into and then for

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,959
example

125
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,559
a wine glass breaks or some other form

126
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,719
of glass a mirror is shattered

127
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,239
you kind of get those mixing of the two

128
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,719
pieces there

129
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,360
now when we're comparing our glass

130
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,039
samples

131
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
the goal is to find and measure the

132
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,639
properties that will associate one glass

133
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,158
fragment to another while minimizing or

134
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,318
limiting the possibility exists

135
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,759
of other sources due to common

136
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:08,878
occurrences of glass it can present

137
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,560
quite a challenge

138
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:11,919
so even though there's glasses of

139
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
different types

140
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,839
it can be a difficult comparison to make

141
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
there there are methods

142
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,280
so just keep that in mind that while

143
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,000
this will help you tell part of the

144
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,758
story

145
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
it's not going to be the one defining

146
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,120
factor it's going to take probably

147
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,759
other ways of collecting of other

148
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,160
evidence

149
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,600
and this would be one component which

150
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,800
could be a very important component

151
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
which is why

152
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,079
when collecting samples we want to be

153
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,000
very mindful of

154
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,639
ensuring we're collecting a quality

155
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,639
sample
