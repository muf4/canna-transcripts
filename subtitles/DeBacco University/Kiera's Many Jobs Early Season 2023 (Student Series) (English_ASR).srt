1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,079
and this debacco University student

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,540
series we're going to get to see Kiera's

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,759
many jobs in the early season of 2023

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,800
where she's progressing become a student

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:14,480
to becoming an employee and learning all

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,480
aspects of cannabis production

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:22,559
[Music]

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,300
all right if you thought cannabis

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,500
growing was just the plants well Kira's

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,719
going to walk us through some different

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,539
aspects that she is getting exposed to

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,098
and it's always nice to see a student

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,320
kind of progress to become an employee

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,558
she's worked her way up to being a true

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,238
play here at Sweet Hill she discusses

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:40,919
The Importance of Being versatile and

17
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,539
flexible since different times of the

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,859
year require different tasks to be

19
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,780
completed we're going to see the early

20
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,700
spring time here this indole is working

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,500
directly with the plants but she also

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,660
has some additional tasks that are

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,780
important to make the entire system

24
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:57,058
company and growing environment work to

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,859
everyone's Advantage now she's going to

26
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,299
start us off in the nursery house which

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,159
is her main job right now in the

28
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,140
springtime where she's taken a bunch of

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,579
clones getting plants established she's

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,560
been scouting for pests and being

31
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,900
proactive in defenses against those

32
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,540
pests and of course the daily plant care

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,159
checking making sure monitoring

34
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,200
the water making sure everything is

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
labeled is making sure the plants are

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,240
able to show their best work so they can

37
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,359
continue into a good vegetative state

38
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,239
let's hear from Kiera now

39
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:30,118
when it's Kiara and today I'm back at

40
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:33,179
Sweet heel or as it's known as Gigi AG

41
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:36,180
Tech where I took you guys last year for

42
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,220
a few tours of their facilities now I'm

43
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,780
an official employee and I want to tell

44
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,780
you about the different jobs that I have

45
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,939
around here so right now we're in our

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,219
Nursery which is where we have all of

47
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,618
our little baby plants just start out

48
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,280
pretty much one of my first stops here

49
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:55,200
was taking many many many

50
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,899
clones of our mother plants and putting

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,399
them into rockwool once they get their

52
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,379
roots in and everything and they're

53
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,618
ready to be transplanted we bring them

54
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:07,199
into here and plant them based on base

55
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:09,479
this here is all Miss B all in front of

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,479
me all behind me and some of our other

57
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,780
plants in here include sour lifter or

58
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,299
Durban Poison but really these misbees

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,219
are my babies

60
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,439
um another job that I typically do while

61
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,239
I'm here is give amendments to these

62
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,560
girls I mean we're pretty much raising

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,719
them so we need to make sure that

64
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,400
they're happy and healthy so one of the

65
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,219
Amendments that we add are these

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,159
Marigold plants marigolds are great for

67
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,620
deterring pests like aphids and thrifts

68
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,919
from your plant as I guess they don't

69
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,300
really like the smell I'm not sure why

70
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,539
another thing that we do to amend our

71
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,879
plants are add beneficial insects some

72
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,519
of the insects that we do add are

73
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:53,699
ladybugs and praying mantises our

74
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,099
ladybugs also eat aphids and thrips and

75
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:58,259
praying mantis really eat anything they

76
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:00,359
could get their hands on which is good

77
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,759
for us when we're trying to eliminate

78
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,860
the pests that we don't want and it also

79
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,679
helps that they're super cute

80
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,420
this is my first and main job which is

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,400
just taking care of the plants making

82
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:14,039
sure the girls are good and everything

83
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,019
that comes with that but I do have a few

84
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,060
different jobs around here as is

85
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,340
everyone else it's the only way to keep

86
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,000
this entire Greenhouse going I'll show

87
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,000
you some of them

88
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,919
so with cannabis not all jobs are flashy

89
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,840
labeling is very important it's a

90
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,719
critical form of documentation as we'll

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,420
see from Kira one of my most important

92
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,878
and arguably most overlooked jobs in

93
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,339
this field is labeling our cannabis

94
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,679
plants I take great pride in making sure

95
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,860
that all of our labels are big legible

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,540
and kind of cute for each of our plants

97
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,099
it's kind of hard to tell the difference

98
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,378
between the two if they're different

99
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:54,959
species or anything based off of the

100
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:57,899
appearance alone so that's why it is so

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,199
important to have big consistent

102
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,299
labeling for all of your plants even if

103
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,039
they are

104
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,379
organized in a way that makes it kind of

105
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,419
easy to guess and figure out what type

106
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:11,878
of plant you have you never really know

107
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,919
which one it could be this one is sour

108
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:16,500
lifter while the one right next door

109
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,238
that looks pretty similar to it is

110
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,238
actually cherry wine

111
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,939
so it is very important for all grows of

112
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,758
any scale or no matter the grower to be

113
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,918
efficiently and properly labeling your

114
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,319
plants this is a step you definitely

115
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,299
don't want to overlook or skip in the

116
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,978
interest of time because at the end of

117
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,240
the day if you don't know what the

118
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:38,579
difference between your plants are

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,819
you're going to lose incredible amounts

120
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,379
of profit and be kind of upset that it

121
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,680
you could have just done that in a half

122
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,680
a second

123
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,198
having a good customer connection a good

124
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,819
marketing is very important because

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,100
unfortunately customers don't get to see

126
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,139
the actual plants the products get the

127
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,639
most eyes sharing the product is well

128
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,379
presented is critical to keep the

129
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,060
business going it needs that continual

130
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,639
attention it makes a great indoor job

131
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,100
for Kira

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,560
another one of my jobs that I kind of

133
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,780
didn't expect going into this field was

134
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,899
dealing with our customers and marketing

135
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,879
now in order for any operation to really

136
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,799
run smoothly everybody kind of needs to

137
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,259
be on board with everything and helping

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,540
out where they can I personally have a

139
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,120
big love for editing things on my phone

140
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,580
or making things just look pretty so I

141
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,100
offered to do some of our promo for our

142
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,279
products what you see here is a light

143
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,460
box that I like to use to take photos in

144
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,899
here we have our canagars very pretty

145
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,939
and so we need to make sure that we get

146
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,519
good photos of them I'll go and I'll

147
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:44,300
take my photos that I take here put them

148
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:48,139
into some form of editing app and create

149
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,340
Tearaway sheets advertisements posters

150
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,720
informationals about each of our

151
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:54,659
products I mean it really just depends

152
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,000
on the day and also depending on if we

153
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,620
change our packaging or if the law has

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,139
ever changed we pretty much need to

155
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,959
update these all of the time so it is a

156
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,400
very critical part of any business to

157
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,159
make sure that you have somebody working

158
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,859
on marketing and farming your customers

159
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,660
at the end of the day this is what gets

160
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,979
your customers attention and not just

161
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,900
how pretty the plants are in the

162
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:17,339
greenhouse

163
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:20,579
right now I'm taking promotional

164
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:23,219
pictures for our canagars this one is

165
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:25,019
our sweet Elite Mountain mango and I

166
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,380
want to make it look as appetizing as

167
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:30,000
possible I don't really have a specific

168
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:32,879
list that I go through when I'm making

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,439
these types of projects but I just kind

170
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,978
of go with what the product really

171
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,139
entails these are very slim pretty so I

172
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:43,318
could just put as many as I want really

173
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,620
in here next to each other make it look

174
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,240
aesthetically pleasing get my photos

175
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:51,538
isolate them within an app and it looks

176
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,060
like you hired a professional so this is

177
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,219
why I really enjoy being able to do all

178
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,439
of our advertising and kind of customer

179
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,240
base things since I being a

180
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,899
perfectionist like to see things like

181
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,418
this and so this is my more indoor job

182
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,159
in sweet heel

183
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,659
now potting up plants may seem

184
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,460
repetitive but there's a lot of

185
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,319
preparation checking and double checking

186
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,180
of equipment while the planting process

187
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,100
can get routine the volume in high

188
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,699
standards makes this an all hands on

189
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,699
deck job

190
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,939
required in in order to even think about

191
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,319
having the plants into this Bay I mean

192
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,478
I'm not sure if you could tell by the

193
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,240
camera angle or not but none of these

194
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,579
pots actually have plants in it we've

195
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,918
spent weeks cleaning this greenhouse

196
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,379
sweeping bleaching making sure that

197
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,299
everything's clean getting our compost

198
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,459
together which we make ourselves at

199
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,740
Sweet Hill in order to make sure that

200
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,959
our plants get proper nutrients and a

201
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,240
proper home to stay in I mean we make

202
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,339
our own compost based off of our organic

203
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,500
material that we go through well

204
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,019
doing our basic day-to-day things here

205
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,598
we had to make sure that our drip lines

206
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,698
are all properly working I mean if just

207
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:05,879
one of those doesn't work then we lose

208
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,819
an entire plant and as meticulous and

209
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,159
tedious as it is we make sure that every

210
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:14,340
single one of them is up and functioning

211
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,939
before the plant comes in we still have

212
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:19,799
this entire Bay to cover before we could

213
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:20,699
say that plants are even allowed to come

214
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
in here

215
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,598
when we do finally put the plants in

216
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,780
here I would say it will take about two

217
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,159
weeks maybe more but I hope to show you

218
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,360
it when we're done instead of talking

219
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,360
about all the prep work

220
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,740
in case you thought planting was easy

221
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:42,179
work I kind of wanted to describe to you

222
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:45,839
how I go about planting our plants now

223
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,299
here seems pretty simple we have a hemp

224
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,580
plant in a pot but it's actually way

225
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,439
more than that and takes up a lot of my

226
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,200
time especially during this part of our

227
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,660
growth season working here in order to

228
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,879
get this plant to look like this we

229
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:02,879
first have to take a clone of it from a

230
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:05,458
mother we then put it into rock wool and

231
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,620
let it root for about two weeks then we

232
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,838
transplant it into a smaller container

233
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,000
and then finally once we think it's

234
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,640
ready there it can go into this

235
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,799
container but that's not it once it's in

236
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,379
this container we make sure that we add

237
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,479
our drip lines for irrigation make sure

238
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:25,019
that all of our fertilizers are properly

239
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,240
working and of the right amounts and add

240
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,399
rice holes to the top to prevent the

241
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,060
soil layer from being all moist and

242
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:37,200
encouraging bug growth now imagine this

243
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:40,319
one plant multiplied by the entirety of

244
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,540
this greenhouse for a few days now my

245
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,940
team and I have been working on this Bay

246
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:48,480
alone right what you see in front of me

247
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,360
and behind me but everything this

248
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,060
direction has still yet to be potted

249
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,759
completely so you can imagine how much

250
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,659
time it takes us just to get a few

251
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,769
plants into some pots

252
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:01,769
