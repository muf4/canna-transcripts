1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
if you're considering coco coir for your

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,759
indoor plant production hopefully you

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,719
tune into this video to gain some

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,720
helpful information provided by debaco

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,720
university

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,039
[Music]

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,679
all right let's get into coco coir for

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,640
indoor cannabis plant production here

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,800
so coco for cuckoo for coconuts uh we're

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,960
looking here coco choir is made up of

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,480
the husk of the coconut you can see

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,480
right here and there's also other

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,160
products from it it's produced primarily

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,479
in sri lanka philippines indonesia

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,718
mexico and parts of the caribbean and

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,398
south america it's a very popular

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,719
growing substrate and it was once

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,719
considered a waste product due to impart

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,879
its very slow decomposition rate which

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,840
takes about 20 years however keep in

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:49,359
mind it can be a little bit of a

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,680
variable product because it is a natural

23
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,320
product so one batch to another may have

24
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,359
some degree of variation while similar

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,439
there is a

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,280
is a natural product so that variation

27
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,599
is to be expected

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,159
so just keep that in mind and companies

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,159
are getting better and decreasing the

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,840
amount of variability you get from one

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,000
batch to another

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,920
there are three types kind of presented

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,239
here there's the cocopith or peat and

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,159
this looks like peat moss retains water

35
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,798
very well to the point that growers need

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,479
to monitor conditions to avoid root rots

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,479
so keep that in mind if you're using

38
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,079
cocoa fibers these are not very

39
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,159
absorbent but do allow for great

40
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,239
aeration of the root zone but will break

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,320
down over time reducing the amount of

42
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:33,039
aeration if you're reusing that

43
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,639
particular substrate and the cocoa chips

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,118
that it does retain water but still

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,719
means porosity so this provides the best

46
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,438
of cocoa pith and fibers kind of like

47
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,118
the kind of in-between role

48
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,039
now the properties just in general if

49
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,799
you want really the kind of scientific

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
properties fiber lengths average tensile

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,360
strength specific gradient elongation

52
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,759
percentages all that's provided here so

53
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,959
in general cocoa can hold water while

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,640
still allowing the roots to have

55
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,399
sufficient aeration

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,000
hold their properties for longer than

57
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,239
standard soilless

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,040
options that are available the ph does

59
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,280
tend to favor the 5.2 to 6.8 range so

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
keep that in mind and this does lack

61
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,598
plant available nutrients but is still

62
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,079
preferred by many growers because of its

63
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,679
main property that is simply inert

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,200
doesn't really react with very many

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,879
things

66
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,439
so again it's popular because of that

67
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,519
aeration to the roots minimal pathogens

68
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,199
as well as a great benefit

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
reduced pest pressure

70
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,719
in the initial substance using it right

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,039
out of the bag or in this case using it

72
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,039
in a container

73
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,959
so when you're purchasing uh this

74
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,878
particular product this coconut choir as

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,878
you can see here is just an example you

76
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,120
want to look to see if the material has

77
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,518
been triple washed to limit the chance

78
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,439
of the substrate containing high salts

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,920
in addition having

80
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,280
an included sds

81
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,719
sheet which is the

82
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,560
safety data sheet helps provide

83
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,400
information about the product and also

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,239
shows a high level of commitment by the

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,480
company that they stand behind their

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,480
product and have gotten it tested make

87
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,598
sure make sure it has multiple rinse

88
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,919
cycles as salt content is possible with

89
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,598
this product and also to ensure

90
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,759
pathogen-free environment there can be

91
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,158
chemical treatments applied so reviewing

92
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,840
the sdsg can be very important to let

93
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,000
you know how that particular company

94
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,080
chose to treat that product

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,560
this product does aggressively hold

96
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,800
calcium magnesium and iron so be sure to

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,519
have these fertilizers on hand if you're

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,680
going to be using this as a substrate

99
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,000
now it's often part of a blend so some

100
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,560
growers grow in like a pure form others

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,199
use it as a blend and it is commonly

102
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,598
mixed with potting soil or also perlite

103
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,439
growers typically do a 50 50 mix of soil

104
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,919
or soilless mixes with the cocoa to kind

105
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,000
of get the benefit of both and we can

106
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,359
see here varying recipes some people

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,400
grow in the street some people have you

108
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,799
know the different

109
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,319
combinations so just be aware whatever

110
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,080
blend you're using it's going to have

111
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,919
slightly different properties

112
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,640
so be aware to be able to handle those

113
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,000
properties in your growing operation

114
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,279
now when you're using cocoa is kind of

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,039
the last statement hopefully you've made

116
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,199
it to the end here growers should be

117
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,438
feeding plants frequently typically

118
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,518
daily or at least every other day to

119
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,840
avoid nutrient deficiencies in this

120
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,759
media particularly in container growing

121
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,759
it's hard to over water this it offers a

122
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,840
great margin for air for newer growers

123
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,319
and make sure you have a calcium

124
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,079
magnesium product on hand

125
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,719
this is great that it also has a little

126
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,560
bit of iron as well so great product to

127
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
have on hand if using coco coir because

128
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,720
those fibers really do hold on to those

129
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,639
calcium those magnesium molecules

130
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,240
greater than what the plant's roots can

131
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,800
take up so supplementing with this

132
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,199
product will ensure your plants avoid

133
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199
any chance of a nutrient deficiency
