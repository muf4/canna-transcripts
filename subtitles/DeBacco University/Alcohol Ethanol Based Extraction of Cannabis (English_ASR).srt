00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
on this debaco university video going to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
go over alcohol or ethanol-based

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,480
extraction of cannabis

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:17,920
to see if this is a method you should be

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:17,920
considering for your operation

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,799
all right let's go over alcohol or

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,079
ethanol based extraction of cannabis

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
so first off what's a general

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,000
description of this method

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,959
well cannabis is thoroughly soaked and

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,558
rinsing 95 to 100 ethanol solution

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,000
until sufficient breakdown of the

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,000
solutes has occurred

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,439
we see it being placed right in here the

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,119
plant material is then removed from the

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,799
mixture and the remaining solution can

17
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,959
either be used in tinctures

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,199
or is heated at precise temperature

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,439
until the ethanol has evaporated

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,480
once all the ethanol has evaporated you

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,799
are left with a dark

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,599
tar-like substance rich in cannabinoids

23
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,718
called the full

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,120
extract cannabinoid oil and we can see

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
the

26
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,038
general process represented here kind of

27
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,439
breaking down

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,520
all the ethanol storage ethanol vesicle

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,118
and collecting vesicle occurring here

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,719
keep in mind though as a reminder

31
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,280
ethanol alcohol is

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,478
a highly flammable solution so again use

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,519
with caution

34
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:12,719
what does one of these actually look

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,839
like i showed you kind of the general

36
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,519
cartoon image

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,520
this is kind of showing the ethanol

38
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,079
machine used for extraction

39
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,000
and distillation bags of cannabis and

40
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,359
ethanol can go right in here we can see

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,400
everything's kind of sealed and locked

42
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,640
down computer controlled

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,159
very important to say cleanness with the

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,759
process very important have control of

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,200
the process because as i said

46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,719
this is a flammable product so what is

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,478
the resulting end product

48
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,239
well the final product is of an

49
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,200
alcohol-based extraction is the full

50
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,759
extract

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,000
canvas oil a highly concentrated whole

52
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,640
plant extract this extract can test

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,239
anywhere from 80 to 99 cannabinoids

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,320
depending on the quality

55
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,239
of the extraction alcohol-based

56
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,959
extraction can also be used to make

57
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,280
tinctures

58
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,199
with the alcohol solution filled with

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,960
cannabinoids that's another advantage of

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,040
this method

61
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,000
now what what are some other advantages

62
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,320
well simply it's

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
cost effective in large amounts alcohol

64
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,359
extraction can pull a broader range

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,520
of compounds from the plant than other

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
extraction methods can be performed at

67
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,319
atmospheric pressure

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,160
so it doesn't need anything really

69
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,679
special we don't want to isolate it from

70
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,840
you know any sort of flame

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,159
and there's no risk of leaving toxic

72
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,878
residual chemicals in the final canvas

73
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,159
extract

74
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,399
these are part of the reasons why it can

75
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,680
become so popular however keep in mind

76
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
there are some disadvantage with this

77
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,519
method

78
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,120
and those do include the fact that

79
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,680
there's a possibility of chlorophyll in

80
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,519
the final product which could

81
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
cause a little bit more of a bitter

82
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,719
taste to the end product

83
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,639
ethyl has a much higher boiling point

84
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,080
than other solvents which could lead to

85
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,159
a longer processing time

86
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,680
post-processing is extensive several

87
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,000
refinements must be made

88
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,719
to the extract before it's consumer

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,159
ready

90
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,680
and it can be extremely dangerous as i

91
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,239
mentioned because it's a signaling fire

92
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,239
hazard

93
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
especially when used indoors with

94
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,759
potential other heating elements

95
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,000
and you know just the storage of the

96
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,679
material in general so all those must be

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,120
taken into consideration

98
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,120
if you're thinking about implementing

99
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,599
this as part of your operation

100
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,959
as you look at methods to extract your

101
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,959
cannabis product
