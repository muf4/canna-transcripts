00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,640
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,318
where i'll be covering cannabis cloning

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,558
options and particularly

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,519
the advantages and disadvantages of two

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,320
main options

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,679
one the cut and stick method into the

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,920
aeroponic cloner

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,920
so come join me

9
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:24,879
[Music]

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,719
all right let's get into the advantages

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,960
and disadvantages of some cloning

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,198
options for cannabis plants

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,359
so first off there are two main methods

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,079
being the cut and stick method

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,000
and then aeroponic cloner now both can

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,759
get you to the same end result but and

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,119
both have their own advantages

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,359
and disadvantages that i'm going to

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,000
cover here so first off the cut and

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,600
stick method

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,439
when we're talking about cloning reason

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,039
why growers typically choose this method

23
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,039
is it's very simple

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,879
it also requires a minimal amount of

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,679
materials so as we can see here we have

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,519
some oasis

27
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,439
blocks some perlite maybe a little

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,520
humidity dome some lighting

29
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,479
nothing too out of the ordinary great

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
advantage

31
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,679
of this cut and stick method we're

32
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,959
simply cutting those vegetative

33
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,879
propagation clones

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,000
and sticking them into the various

35
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,759
substrate

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,599
however there are some disadvantages

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,359
with this method as well

38
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,879
one you really cannot see the roots so

39
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,118
as a grower kind of guessing

40
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,000
and this can be a slower method of

41
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,438
rooting

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,438
if you're looking at where you need to

43
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:21,839
really be under the gun to go through

44
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,118
and

45
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,040
you know turn one over with the next one

46
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,400
this can be a little bit slower of a

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,560
process

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,159
now compared to aeroponic cloner a great

49
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,840
advantage of the aeroponic car

50
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,400
is it allows the growers to physically

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,159
and actually visually see the roots

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,240
it's a very efficient method of

53
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,320
production and it can allow for interval

54
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,599
individual clones to be transferred at

55
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,359
the ideal time

56
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,078
simply because the grower can actually

57
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,560
see the roots this can allow individuals

58
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,319
to be

59
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,000
transferred over to the next step at the

60
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,239
right or up to optimum

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,118
time however there are disadvantages

62
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,438
with the

63
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,239
aeroponic cloning method and this does

64
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,919
require

65
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,399
special equipment and an electrical

66
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,240
power source also growers can lose the

67
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
entire batch of clones that they may

68
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,920
have going

69
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,080
if there's an issue reason why this is

70
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
your minimal buffering system so ph is

71
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
really important to dial in

72
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,200
again can potentially turn clones out a

73
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
little bit faster

74
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,799
allow growers to see it but again

75
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,439
requires some special equipment

76
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
and does have a tendency for the growers

77
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,239
to be a little bit

78
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
more attention to detail with the

79
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,280
aeroponic cloner

80
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,400
so this gave you good pros and cons of

81
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,199
each if there's one you want to learn

82
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,800
