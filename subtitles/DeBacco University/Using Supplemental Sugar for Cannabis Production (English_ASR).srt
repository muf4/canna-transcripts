1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,919
if you're considering adding sugar to

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:08,480
help your canvas plants grow

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,480
this debaco university video is for you

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,759
[Music]

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,439
all right let's look at using

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,080
supplemental sugar for cannabis

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,439
production

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,519
you might say sugar we're not talking

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,960
about candy per se but you kind of get

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,518
the idea

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,199
so as always here's a reference article

12
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,919
if you want to look at researching

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,079
on sugar applications to crops may not

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,719
be necessary 100 specific to cannabis

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,039
but does

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,000
allow some information we can start to

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,799
build some potential conclusions from

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
so first off here is their results from

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,038
their study they did a

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,879
foliar sugar treatments comparison here

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,320
and we could see that their untreated

22
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,718
check

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,960
grain sugar cane high fructose corn

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,960
syrup molasses blackstrap molasses green

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,920
layered cane sugar

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,600
granulated cane sugar 100 sucrose and

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,440
again blackstrap molasses looking at

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
different kind of application rates

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,039
and we're kind of seeing the soybean

30
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,920
yield in bushels

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,680
per acre kind of presented here so again

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
we're all looking at soybeans but we can

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,600
see there's not

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,840
necessarily a clear winner

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,519
here in comparison so we need to keep

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,280
that in mind

37
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,959
now we're looking at sugar where it

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,159
would be benefits to sugar well

39
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,079
ladybiddies

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,080
consuming sugar increased the survival

41
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,840
rate of the females and resulted in

42
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,478
increased egg production

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,478
as compared to beetles who were not

44
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,039
provided sugar in their diets

45
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,118
kind of an interesting finding there the

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
researchers suggested sugar

47
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,478
feeding is very important for lady

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,040
beetle populations and a possible way to

49
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,920
help maintain beneficial species in

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,360
an agro-ecosystem lady beetles stayed

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,439
about 20 to 30 percent

52
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,560
longer in plots where sugar water was

53
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,959
applied

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,719
than untreated plots in the first four

55
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,438
to six hours after spraying a sugar

56
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,959
solution

57
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,758
lady beetles and the sugar-treated

58
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,359
plants rose by a factor of 10 to 20.

59
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,879
so kind of an interesting thing here

60
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,519
we're maybe not seeing a change in the

61
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,039
plants

62
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,039
but we're trying to increase and

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,599
maintain our beneficial

64
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,599
on insect populations well this may have

65
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,119
some potential merit

66
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,119
so plant defense signaling related to

67
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,439
sugar in rice so we're looking at

68
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,878
rice production sugar sugar applications

69
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,199
to the root system resulted

70
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,120
in overexpression of genes in which

71
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,519
induced defense mechanisms within the

72
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
plant

73
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200
again here we're looking at rice

74
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,919
spraying sugar solutions and plants via

75
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,359
boiler in solar drenches resulted in

76
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,359
half the disease pressure

77
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,120
that is in the control plants one week

78
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
later so kind of an interesting finding

79
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,959
here

80
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,039
looking at the changing and gene

81
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,959
regulation in rice plants

82
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,239
15 days later control plants exhibited

83
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,159
severe disease compared to the

84
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
sugar-treated plants suggesting

85
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,318
foliar applications of sugar prior to an

86
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,280
attack by a plant pathogen

87
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,079
could signal plant defense response

88
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,479
responses

89
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,319
resulting in increased plant resistance

90
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,919
to that particular pathogen

91
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,079
the researchers also went on to note

92
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,079
that all plants were at the

93
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
four leaf stage during research and were

94
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,200
curious if they induced resistance

95
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,719
would continue as the plants matured so

96
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,518
it definitely shows potential promise at

97
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,519
least in rice

98
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
for the early application might be

99
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,879
something worth considering

100
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
for cannabis production as well

101
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,000
particularly that early application

102
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,079
before you're getting into your buds and

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,158
flowers so

104
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,519
why not apply it to cannabis though

105
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,039
research has shown no statistical

106
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,879
difference among sugar sources when

107
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,759
applied to corn or soybeans with no

108
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,759
statistical

109
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,280
increase numerous research studies have

110
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,120
documented increase in beneficial

111
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,400
insects and fields and plus treated with

112
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,200
sugar water solution

113
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,799
station application of the solution as a

114
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,839
bio control method reducing pest

115
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
populations

116
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,759
so for example if you have aphids and

117
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,840
want to increase your lady beauty

118
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,959
beetle population well sugar might be a

119
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,799
worthy addition

120
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,319
particularly in those early stages of

121
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,400
growth well as

122
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,238
yet much research to be done sugar does

123
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,158
play an important role in inducing plant

124
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,560
defense responses and recent studies

125
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,639
have shown reduced disease levels in

126
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,039
rice after application of sugar

127
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,878
prior to pathogen infection so again

128
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,560
just another consideration there

129
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,000
is it going to be a catch-all save all

130
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,959
no but does that have some potential

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,759
benefits

132
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,680
yes if those benefits match your growing

133
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,598
situations then it might be worth

134
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,239
considering adding to your cannabis

135
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,238
plants
