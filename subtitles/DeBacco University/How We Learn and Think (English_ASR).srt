1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,159
okay here a little bit about how we

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,528
learn in things how do we process

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,129
information how do we go through a

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:13,349
problem I work together to solve a

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,139
solution or how do we look at a

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,600
situation it might be ever-changing how

7
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:20,519
do we maximize our returns there so

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,060
thinking is allowed in this section here

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,890
in particular so first off looking at

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,629
how we learn in thankful our brain is

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,570
where most this action occurs and

12
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:33,359
consists of billions of interconnected

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,130
neurons our senses to a specific neuron

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,869
pathways we have something called

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,120
short-term memory which is residual

16
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,859
sensitivity pathways and they have

17
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,409
long-term memory which is physical

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,799
changes that may occur and long-term

19
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:49,709
memory can cause by repeated stimulation

20
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:52,679
intense emotion sensory input in memory

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,590
storage share the same circuits and it's

22
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,929
causes associations to occur so you'll

23
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,149
find a lot in the slides that I provide

24
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:01,558
here there's pictures produced the

25
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,989
pictures here so you can kind of try to

26
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,969
make associations in connections to

27
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:08,310
hopefully take something a topic that

28
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,750
might be new to you that might just go

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,250
into the short-term memory and try to

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,920
make it a little bit more longer-lasting

31
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,629
in your memory

32
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,150
so how II know things well our brains

33
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,339
are gated two major things recognizing

34
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,080
patterns and filling in sensory gaps

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,759
through typically through the process of

36
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,579
storytelling so you can see there's a

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,500
different pattern here just as here

38
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,090
there's a pattern we can look at this

39
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,159
pattern determine what comes next

40
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,939
so take a look here for a second

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,850
determine what comes next

42
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:41,728
well if you said a green rectangle you'd

43
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:45,559
be correct let's do this again for this

44
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,560
pattern what comes next

45
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:55,590
if you said yellow star you'd be correct

46
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:58,618
and lastly what comes next here if you

47
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,790
said blue square you would be correct so

48
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,259
you can see it were able to quickly

49
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,090
recognize and identify these patterns

50
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:07,078
however want to be careful because this

51
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,118
can get us into trouble

52
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:10,859
through pattern matching record we could

53
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,949
recognize patterns that may not be real

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,050
or misinterpreted or we could not

55
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,818
patterns that are real so we're looking

56
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,620
at developing patterns while we're very

57
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:22,169
good at doing that want to make sure

58
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,629
that we're not have matching a pattern

59
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:25,259
that may not exist there for

60
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:27,509
storytelling

61
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:28,409
not checking to see if stories are true

62
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:31,679
could be an issue

63
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:34,530
80% personal disagreements are between

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,989
people that begin as wrong stories each

65
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,049
has told himself about the other's

66
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:42,360
motivations so you get into this like he

67
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,650
said she said type things so you want to

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,209
make sure when you're doing storytelling

69
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,039
that you're able to fact-checked

70
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:51,269
certain things you want to just go off

71
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:53,009
rumors in hearsay in science we're

72
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,539
looking at testing our patterns and

73
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:57,269
stories we typically do this ooh a

74
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:59,250
variation of the scientific method where

75
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,469
we have observations that lead iPod this

76
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,449
is allow us to test our hypothesis that

77
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:05,430
then through analysis observations we

78
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,289
can modify that Baathists go through

79
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,629
more observations this is what we tend

80
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:10,769
to get into this kind of circle here if

81
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:12,889
you have observations that lead to

82
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,789
questions those questions and hopefully

83
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:16,529
hypothesis that we can test we

84
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:19,138
experiment analyze we draw a conclusion

85
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,939
and we do more observations which leads

86
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,170
to more questions and so on and so forth

87
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,629
so we kind of have this kind of

88
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,369
revolving kind of circle here doesn't

89
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,349
known as you have interloop in internal

90
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,599
loops that occur here the key part here

91
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,729
in science in general is to stay

92
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,888
inquisitive to keep asking questions to

93
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:36,509
keep trying to find something else to

94
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,219
develop some conclusions but also

95
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:40,729
develop some more questioning as you go

96
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:44,129
through and do some more observations

97
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:47,068
specifically for studying relating this

98
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:49,139
to class three hours of study at one

99
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:51,179
time is not effective for long-term

100
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,639
memory information staying the same

101
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,530
thing 20 minutes three times a day for

102
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,019
three days is more effective for

103
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,729
long-term memory formation so we don't

104
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,469
want to focus on there's a lot of the

105
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:02,969
topics we're going to go over we're

106
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,229
going to come back and relate to and I'm

107
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:06,359
going to assume that you know down when

108
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,638
we first went over them using your brain

109
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,069
to B phase or reworked material is more

110
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,530
effective for long-term memory formation

111
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:14,699
then repetitive reading or listening so

112
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,180
the effective as these video lectures

113
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:20,548
may be for listening and repetitive over

114
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm sure you can rephrase and rework the

115
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:24,089
information hopefully we're able to do

116
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,879
more of that in class they're able to

117
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,810
develop that more long-term memory

118
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,360
implication

119
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,860
for the material that we go over we keep

120
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,389
in mind cram studying for three hours a

121
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,819
night before the test is not as

122
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,949
effective saying the same thing for 20

123
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:40,680
minutes three times a day for three days

124
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:42,120
is much more effective hopefully you're

125
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,709
able to plan ahead and do some of that

126
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,709
throughout this course
