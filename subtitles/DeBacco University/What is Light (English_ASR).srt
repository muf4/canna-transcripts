1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
okay here we're looking at the simple

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:05,789
question what is light keep in mind when

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,049
we're relating it to plants we want to

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,650
keep in mind whether we're talking about

5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,449
a actual sunlight or for looking at

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,298
artificial light and how that may differ

7
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:17,730
between the two and what spectrums they

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:20,189
may give so first off we're looking at

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,750
the electromagnetic spectrum which is

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,179
the range of all types of

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,759
electromagnetic radiation the radiation

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,070
is energy that travels and spreads out

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,618
as it travels examples of though are

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,179
radio waves visible light which is only

15
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,820
a small portion of the full

16
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,500
electromagnetic spectrum UV light in

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,628
x-rays and gamma-rays

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,509
also so again keep in mind of this

19
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:45,899
entire range only a very small portion

20
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,399
of that is actually visible light the

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,109
light spectrum it's many different

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,629
wavelengths of energy produced by a

23
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,729
light source now light is measured and

24
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:55,558
it's called nanometers and you can think

25
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:57,750
of that as really small meters each

26
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,909
nanometer represents a wavelength of

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,070
light or band of energy but this image

28
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,859
prism tries to show here we have white

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,118
light coming in and we have the

30
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,430
different colors being separated out

31
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,019
however if we look closely and also we

32
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,450
see that here there's different

33
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,519
wavelengths so you can see the red is a

34
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,680
much longer wavelength than say the

35
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,359
Indigo or the violet down here much

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,060
shorter wavelength we see that also down

37
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,769
over here also keep in mind this light

38
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,750
spectrum is visible light is only a very

39
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,719
small portion of the entire

40
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,978
electromagnetic spectrum so it brings a

41
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,170
question of well what's sun light

42
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,599
suddenly something gives off infrared

43
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,650
visible and ultraviolet light so it's

44
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,408
filtered through the Earth's atmosphere

45
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,540
and is a combination of that ultraviolet

46
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,780
or UV light visible light and also

47
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,939
infrared radiation between Terp as heat

48
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,570
so sometimes a wide variety of things

49
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,798
more than just what we visibly can see

50
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:52,169
so what's that visible light well that

51
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,670
visible spectrum is the portion of the

52
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,129
electromagnetic spectrum that's visible

53
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,399
to the human eye in typical human I

54
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:01,769
respond to wavelengths from 380 to 740

55
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,680
nanometers again a very small range of

56
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:06,030
the entire electromagnetic spectrum one

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,459
thing I do want to point out as we saw

58
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,050
in the previous images radio eights are

59
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,300
still the long waves but in this case

60
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,900
they're on the right-hand side and some

61
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,519
of the other images they're on the left

62
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,188
- inside so just keep in mind you have

63
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,610
to be looking at the units we see any

64
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:24,188
sort of spectrum or chart here red is

65
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,780
kind of that larger wave length and

66
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:27,128
those violets and blues are those

67
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,169
shorter wavelengths that'll always

68
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:30,009
remain a constant keep in mind doesn't

69
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:32,679
mean they're always going to be on the

70
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:36,158
left or the right side now color

71
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,769
temperature this is measured in degrees

72
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:40,509
Kelvin is more for us humans than the

73
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,188
plants were trying to grow so a lot of

74
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:43,870
emphasis is put on the Kelvin

75
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:46,328
temperature chart when looking at

76
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,299
interior lighting for lighting up a

77
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:50,709
particular room because our eyes have a

78
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:52,329
harder time distinguishing changes at

79
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,219
the ends are the blue and red colors of

80
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:58,120
the visible light our eyes are actually

81
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:59,348
Mohsen to green or 555 nanometers here

82
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,959
at the highest perceived brightness

83
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:03,938
these other warm whites neutrals or

84
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,370
daylight's again apply more to interior

85
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:08,769
design than it does plants even though

86
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,139
some grow lights will quote the color

87
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:13,530
temperature it's of little importance to

88
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,530
plants
