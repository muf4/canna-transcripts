00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,879
in this debaco university video bloom

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,160
nutrient options will be considered

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,839
when we're looking at cannabis

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,720
production to give you a better

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,559
understanding

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:17,030
of just what this classification of

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:19,839
nutrients is all about

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,199
[Music]

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,118
all right let's get into bloom nutrient

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,439
options for cannabis production

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,559
so first off the nutrient shift that

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,960
does occur

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,079
during the bloom phase the nutrient

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,839
requirements of cannabis will

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,119
change as it starts to flower with less

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,280
demand for nitrogen

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,238
and more phosphorus and potassium being

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,000
needed

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,640
however keep in mind this is within

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,878
reason you cannot force feed plants high

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
amounts of any nutrient without damage

22
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,320
and just because we're saying it's less

23
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,919
demand on nitrogen does it mean that's

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
no demand on nitrogen

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,079
there's no exact ideal ratio of nitrogen

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,920
phosphorus potassium fertilizer

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,679
but growers should be careful not to

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,359
over add nutrients

29
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,399
since this can cause damage to the

30
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,719
plants also you can continue to use veg

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,679
or grow nutrients as this are often kept

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,159
in rotation

33
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,438
for the duration of the growing cycle

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,799
simply don't think that just because it

35
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,359
says a veg nutrient

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,000
you cannot use it during the bloom phase

37
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,000
or flowering

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,519
phase you might use it to a less extent

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,079
but still can be used throughout the

40
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,200
entire growing phase of that plant

41
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,759
we want to look at we want to look at

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,359
fertilizer ratios when you

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,680
and the plant are adjusting through the

44
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,478
growing cycle be sure to keep an extra

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,479
eye on your plants and continue to keep

46
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,400
a diligent log of documenting what you

47
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,599
fertilize and how much you fertilize

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,400
a good starting point is to go with a

49
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,959
consideration of a 2 to 1 to 2 ratio

50
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,320
during flower during the grow phase

51
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,879
and then when you're going flipping to

52
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,639
that flowering phase taking those ratios

53
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,118
and adjusting them to a one to two to

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,118
one ratio used in rotation

55
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,159
with the vegeta the vegetative stage

56
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,319
formulation

57
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,479
during the flowering phase so what does

58
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,679
that mean it's it's twice as much

59
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,438
nitrogen and potassium as it is

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
phosphorus and then this is twice as

61
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,758
much phosphorous as it is nitrogen and

62
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,718
potassium

63
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,718
but this doesn't mean you just

64
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,759
completely disregard these use them in

65
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,280
rotation

66
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,878
where to get these ratios will you look

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,318
at the guaranteed analysis

68
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,159
that's giving your nitrogen phosphorus

69
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,639
potassium but also keep in mind

70
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,919
many fertilizers are also including a

71
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,318
micronutrient blend as well

72
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,839
now do not forget about calcium as well

73
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,199
so this is just another nutrient to take

74
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,520
into consideration

75
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,199
while the main three primary nutrients

76
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,719
are the focus growers should

77
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,039
also be on the lookout for calcium

78
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,000
deficiency as well as this tends to be

79
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,000
more common

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,519
later in the season unless you're

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,878
growing in coco choir where the

82
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
threat exists during basically the

83
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,518
entire growing season calcium should be

84
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,920
kept in mind particularly at the later

85
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,360
phase that flowering phase of growths of

86
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,919
the grow cycle

87
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,360
lastly in final flower development we're

88
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,958
looking at one right here

89
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,319
week six seven and eight make up the

90
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,039
final stages of flowering in most

91
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,318
strains

92
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,400
flowering development is often

93
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,158
determined by inspecting the trichomes

94
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,560
and tracking basically their change in

95
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,158
coloration as the color change occurs

96
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,199
often growers will reduce and flush

97
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,280
their plants

98
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,199
with plain water to reduce the amount of

99
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,719
salt buildup in the root zone

100
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,399
this will ensure also that there's no

101
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,719
fertilizer residues in the buds which

102
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,039
could

103
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,318
impact the final product and taste as

104
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,239
well as inspection

105
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,079
so again that finer flower development

106
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,439
is nearing that couple little things you

107
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
do at the very end

108
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:27,039
to maximize the quality of your end

109
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,039
product
