1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,969
so when growing plants it's always wise

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,349
to have a check-in balance system just

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:09,750
like the government here between the

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:11,968
Justice we want to make sure that we

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,199
also have a balanced system waited just

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,410
a check to make sure everything's

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,448
running efficiently as possible so

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,399
having a system to check conditions it

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,679
could be a checklist mental checklist or

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,028
written checklist all good ideas sitting

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,710
timers that are friendly to your

12
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,679
schedule so just lights and irrigation

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,420
also benefit this meaning it could be

14
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,579
getting up in the morning make sure the

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,170
lights are on or at night making sure

16
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,270
the lights go off something that's

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,289
friendly to you your schedule especially

18
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,510
if you're growing in completely

19
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,700
controlled conditions just so you have a

20
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:43,469
way of just kind of double-checking to

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,859
make sure that the timers are all

22
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:49,289
working properly consistency for plants

23
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,229
and for growers is a good thing this can

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,590
help ensure accuracy predictions for the

25
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,718
plants and also provide the growers with

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,850
early identification when something

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,980
isn't going right having anything right

28
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,989
and lying and I'll set something that

29
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,329
gets out of line it's very easy quickly

30
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,950
to identify that to minimize the impact

31
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:11,489
that will have on the overall growth

32
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,650
cycle of the plants plan for failures so

33
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,390
how the backup products ready to go if

34
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,580
you know while they're eventually going

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,140
to fail so for example don't just have a

36
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,900
one water pump and that's all that you

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,460
have have the backup of the same size so

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,990
it clicks here quick and easy change

39
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:26,459
light bulbs you know they're going to

40
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:29,250
aged reflectors you don't have to be

41
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,359
changing those as well as timers any one

42
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,828
of these things could fail without

43
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,140
notice so you want to make sure you're

44
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:35,669
going through and changing that out as

45
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,560
quickly as you can identify the problems

46
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,109
have having to order that and having

47
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,070
inconsistencies or having something

48
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,640
that's not able to work properly

49
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,438
ventilation you want to make sure you

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,989
have sufficient ventilation as this will

51
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,279
cause thermo stratification and will

52
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:51,420
expose Prince to variations in

53
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,810
temperature too and make sure you're

54
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,640
having a fan to help move some air

55
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,740
around help decrease disease pressure

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,659
also making sure the carbon oxide is

57
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:03,419
getting mixed well in the air also

58
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,950
having a fan will help reduce the chance

59
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,140
of getting weaker stocks because if you

60
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,729
don't have a ventilation weaker stops

61
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,360
will develop and this could be a fan

62
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,500
goes out you're not planning for that

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,890
and the plants going through a rapid

64
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,900
growth

65
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:19,019
is weaker stocks could develop as the

66
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,300
end result lack of light so poor light

67
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,830
can reduce yields reduced light can also

68
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,510
increase the plants tendency to stretch

69
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,280
and get leggy is going to be an extreme

70
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:28,530
example a really stretchy leggy clamp

71
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,509
this can also increase the odds of plant

72
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,849
damage not only in place but if you're

73
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:35,789
going to removing it from a vegetative

74
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,709
room to a flower room lastly I want to

75
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,120
have consistent irrigation to the plants

76
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,280
because not having regular irrigation

77
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,689
can cause undue plants trash you know

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,560
these plants are gonna be drinking these

79
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:45,599
plants are going to be needing

80
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,909
irrigation and water want to make sure

81
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,019
they're constantly shed that is you

82
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,370
don't want to stunt the plants because

83
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,350
that can lead to long-term damage

84
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,969
especially if it occurs early in the

85
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:56,069
growth in development of those plants

86
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,209
also does not allow the grower to know

87
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,849
if or when something might be going

88
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,739
wrong or failing so having the system of

89
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:05,209
checking if using a barrel system a

90
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:08,039
meter some way of assessing the

91
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:11,340
irrigation or the water moisture content

92
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,039
in the irrigation medium that is all

93
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,180
very important there's irrigation events

94
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,500
should be regular should have an idea

95
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,299
when they're coming on show you know how

96
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,769
much water you're giving the plants and

97
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,450
keep in mind this may change over the

98
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,549
growing season as the plants get bigger

99
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:25,798
but having that check in balanced system

100
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,319
for all of these parameters is advised

101
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,560
because it helps you identify issues

102
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,419
early on decreasing the chance that it

103
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,129
could have a negative large negative

104
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,129
impact on your final product
