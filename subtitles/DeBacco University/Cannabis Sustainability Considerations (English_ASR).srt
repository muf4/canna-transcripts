1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,160
as the growing and production of

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,240
cannabis continues to gain popularity

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,519
we need to have considerations towards

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,839
its long-term

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,678
sustainability here on this tobacco

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,279
university video the goal here

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,440
is going to be to cover some of these

8
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,960
major topics regarding cannabis

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,960
sustainability for the long run

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,879
[Music]

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,960
all right let's look at cannabis

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,198
sustainability considerations

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,480
so first off cannabis cultivation is

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,320
kind of emerging

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,599
with the start of the increase in

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,238
popularity due to

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
uh produced cannabis plants this is the

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,839
time to ensure

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,719
that it starts on the proper path or

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,640
just in the early

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,759
phases let's start on the proper path

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,920
and go forward

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,679
in a sustainable manner growers need to

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,719
be considering the sustainability of

25
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,119
their practices

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,558
no matter the size of their operation a

27
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,479
lot of times it's like oh i'm a small

28
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,399
operation i have to worry about it

29
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,878
larger operations need to worry about it

30
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,600
really everyone needs to be considerate

31
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,959
of the sustainability of agricultural in

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,920
general

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,759
so correcting past problems so uh going

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,040
looking back maybe not necessarily this

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,478
far back

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,080
but seeing problems that have developed

37
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,200
in other industries

38
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:27,840
the goal should be of that of prevention

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:27,840
over over sustainability

40
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,679
all right so let's get into cannabis

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,920
sustainability considerations

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
so first off cannabis cultivation is

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,719
emerging

44
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,118
with the start of the increase in

45
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,959
popularity to produce cannabis plants

46
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:48,399
this is the time to ensure that it

47
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,919
starts and continues on the proper path

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,759
so we're kind of just coming into this

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,118
kind of emerging industry if we correct

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
the problems now and make it more

51
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:55,680
sustainable now

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,319
that can continue and be the path of the

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,320
future growers need to be considering

54
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,039
the sustainability of their practices

55
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,078
no matter the size of their operation

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,920
many birds think of

57
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,759
a small operation have to worry about it

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,360
that's more for larger operations

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,959
and that's false everyone needs to be

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
considering the sustainability of their

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,920
practices

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,159
no matter how large or small of a

63
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,958
growing operation that they have

64
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,479
so we want to correct past problems so

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,560
when we say past problems we

66
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,000
may not be going back as far as kind of

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,598
egyptian times but

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
seeing problems that have developed in

69
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,119
other industries the goal should be

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,120
that of prevention and overall

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
sustainability want to correct problems

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
before they become a major

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,599
problem many see cannabis at its own

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,920
category in

75
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,518
kind of many ways it can be but

76
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,119
considering large-scale production

77
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,879
sustainability is important

78
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,640
even if you're only going to be a small

79
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,239
indoor grower you want to be

80
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,479
considerate of all the environmental

81
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,039
impacts this plant may have

82
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,159
and you must think big picture so many

83
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,000
growers come from a small

84
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,759
under 10 plant growing perspective or

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,360
that's how they kind of perceive or see

86
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,598
cannabis as being this kind of small

87
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
a couple plants go from there however

88
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,479
growers need to consider scalability of

89
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,560
their actions

90
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,238
if you're growing 10 plants would you or

91
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,719
could you implement the same practices

92
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,480
again given a limited budget would that

93
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,800
be possible with 10 000

94
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,399
plants what would be the overall impact

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,280
of that

96
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,158
any little waste you scale it up from 10

97
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,199
plants it becomes

98
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,798
a much larger waste problem

99
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,479
so i'm going to use phosphorus here as

100
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
just an example because

101
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,000
a lot of growers over fertilize their

102
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,719
plants with phosphorus so

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,560
canvas as many other plants do need

104
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,598
phosphorus however many burrows are over

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,360
applying it

106
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,798
and i say over applying phosphorus or

107
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
over applying it without

108
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,200
even realizing it which is part of the

109
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,199
problem phosphorus toxicity is not as

110
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,238
obvious as nitrogen so many growers are

111
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,878
unknowingly

112
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,280
over applying phosphorus with no at

113
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,439
least

114
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,360
visual negative impacts however

115
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,959
phosphorus is becoming a limiting

116
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,879
resource and is a fresh water

117
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
contaminant so you're using these heavy

118
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,479
kind of bloom based fertilizers

119
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,400
to avoid any chance of yelling the

120
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,039
leaves well that could be contributing

121
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,519
to

122
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,079
fresh water algae blooms and

123
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,080
contamination of that water supply

124
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,360
so yelling leaves has a lot more

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,959
implications potentially than just

126
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,040
phosphorus deficiency could be disease

127
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,600
could be a whole host of other things

128
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,719
but growers are often way over adding

129
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,239
their phosphorus now because you get

130
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,759
into toxicity levels

131
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,519
because the plants visually don't show a

132
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,319
lot of negative effects growers are very

133
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,839
apt to do it

134
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,439
because they don't even realize they're

135
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,799
doing it at the time

136
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,719
and you don't want to waste a limited

137
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
resource a phosphorus is a limited

138
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,680
resource

139
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,520
chemist growers need to be aware of how

140
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
much phosphorus their plants need

141
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,560
and how much phosphorus they can their

142
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
plants can uptake and

143
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,000
and how that compares to the amount that

144
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,600
they're applying

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,680
many are over applying and do not

146
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,759
realize the waste and potential negative

147
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,478
impacts on the environment they could be

148
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,680
having

149
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,000
so it's very important to have that

150
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,840
education there to realize that there is

151
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
negative implications of over applying

152
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,519
phosphorus

153
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
so why do we need to transform the

154
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,758
phosphorus use in the global food system

155
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
so this

156
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,840
even goes beyond just looking at

157
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,400
cannabis but phosphorus is basically

158
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,599
food it's needed for a whole host of

159
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,599
plants

160
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,759
the growing food demand is equal to

161
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,520
growing uh phosphorus demand

162
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,199
there's only a finite amount of

163
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,439
phosphorus this is going to lead to

164
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,680
potential for geopolitical risks

165
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,279
insufficient global food system to

166
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
distribute that food

167
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,079
increased fertilizer cost as the

168
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,919
phosphorus that we're getting to in some

169
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,359
of the mines is becoming less pure

170
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,519
and there's really no guidelines there

171
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,720
are no regulations of phosphorus

172
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,120
and give you the idea of this kind of

173
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,199
geopolitical risk five countries control

174
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,560
almost 90 percent of the global

175
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,879
phosphate reserves

176
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
eight countries control uh account for

177
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,478
about 65 percent of the

178
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,038
global sulfuric acid production so only

179
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:48,079
five controlling 90 percent

180
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,719
um that could be a major area of concern

181
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,800
with

182
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,360
china and morocco being the greatest

183
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,400
percentages as far as countries go

184
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,080
we also need to think we're talking

185
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,638
about chemical waste disposal and this

186
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,639
concludes

187
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,478
all products that are required for plant

188
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,560
production some are

189
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,318
disposable and some are short-term used

190
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,319
others may be longer-term use

191
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,840
but in the end they all must be disposed

192
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,280
of in some way

193
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,799
just consider where the products you

194
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,799
purchase end up and just have that

195
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,639
mindset or that consideration

196
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,360
for anything that you're utilizing as

197
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,199
part of your plant production

198
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,960
so lastly here just to focus on one

199
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
thing is looking at artificial lighting

200
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,159
we want to be considerate of the

201
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,638
physical components of that artificial

202
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,319
lighting

203
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,840
this is the ballast the bulbs the cords

204
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,840
as well as other lighting equipment

205
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,519
and also the electrical needs all lights

206
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,638
consume power so where is this power

207
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,918
coming from

208
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
now if you're looking at growing outdoor

209
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,918
cannabis you might think well i don't

210
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,799
need lighting

211
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,719
but we want to be thinking of

212
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,520
potentially your weed control options

213
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
your plastic

214
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,240
consumption and things like that so no

215
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,959
system is completely free of any waste

216
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,639
products

217
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,159
good to have an idea of where that's

218
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,918
going to end up

219
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,599
how you're going to utilize that and how

220
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:55,159
you're going to grow your plant

221
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:58,159
in a efficient as well as a sustainable

222
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,160
way
