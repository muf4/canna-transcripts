00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
welcome to another video here on tobacco

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,080
university

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,839
you've tuned into one on fracture

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,960
patterns in glass

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,880
so here we're going to go over some of

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,639
the details we sewed with the fracture

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,599
pattern so you can better understand how

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,279
glass breaks

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
and what it can tell us about what may

10
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,839
have happened to cause this to occur

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,400
so first off fracture patterns glass

12
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,480
does have some flexibility when it's hit

13
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,640
so there's subtle stretching that can

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,560
occur as the force increases though

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,679
fracture lines first appear which may be

16
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,839
followed by the glass

17
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,119
breaking so we don't necessarily always

18
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,079
need the glass to break to get these

19
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,599
fracture lines

20
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,679
but a lot of times it will be present

21
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
when right before glass breaks

22
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,960
and then there will be sometimes

23
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,960
artifacts left at the

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,320
end so it's really important to look at

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,679
some of the details

26
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,439
because those fracture patterns on the

27
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,439
broken glass can provide clues about the

28
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,238
direction and also the rate of the

29
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,439
impact

30
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,839
even though this is more of a

31
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,519
qualitative data than more of a

32
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,320
quantitative number quantitation can get

33
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,399
numbers

34
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,439
more of a qualitative kind of assessment

35
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,960
of what's going on

36
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,519
it still can provide some valuable

37
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,198
information so we're looking at our

38
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,719
shattered glass kind of this is our

39
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,200
original glass point this is our

40
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,000
direction in point of impact we have

41
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,000
concentric

42
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,920
fractures occurring flakes and chips

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
radial fractures so there's a lot going

44
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,118
on here

45
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,200
well when the force is applied to the

46
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,159
glass it'll break in a very specific

47
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,159
manner

48
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,680
glass begins to break in the opposite

49
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,880
direction of the force so here's the

50
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,520
force

51
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,478
here's the direction that it's breaking

52
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,399
and there's

53
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,519
two types of fractures the radial and

54
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,439
the concentric

55
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,359
fractures we'll see some examples of

56
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,399
those in addition to being here

57
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,159
on some actual pieces of glass so as

58
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,159
force is applied to the glass

59
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
a flat piece of glass what is actually

60
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,159
happening well as the force is applied

61
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,599
near the surface of the glass the glass

62
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,040
bends electricity

63
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,879
and kind of near the surface under

64
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,560
compression that is

65
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,719
the far surface under tensions you're

66
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,640
getting it's kind of like bulge to occur

67
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,920
the fracture will start to deflect on

68
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,079
the opposite surface

69
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,079
the fracture will move towards the near

70
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,599
surface and simultaneously move

71
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,279
outward from the central point of the

72
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,319
fracture starting to kind of get this

73
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,159
expansion

74
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,239
phase from that compression that tension

75
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,000
is spreading in this case up and down on

76
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,200
this vertical piece of glass

77
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
the fractures that radiate from the

78
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,000
central point are called radial

79
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
fractures

80
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,120
the fracture may stop at this point but

81
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200
there is still stress

82
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,719
as yet to be released when this force is

83
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,318
being applied

84
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,560
so when the far surface is put under

85
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,479
tension at the point of the force

86
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,598
areas around this tension are then

87
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,840
compressed

88
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,199
this stress causes the tension on or

89
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,680
near the surface of the glass which can

90
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,598
cause fractures on the near surface

91
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,599
so basically what's happening we can see

92
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,639
here in the picture number three

93
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,799
well that's occurring of this

94
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,399
compression we have this tension because

95
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,439
we have that bending we're having these

96
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,039
other points of high stress

97
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,560
and that's what's causing these fracture

98
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,679
points these kind of weak points to

99
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,239
develop

100
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,840
within the piece of glass because we're

101
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,640
talking over a larger area we're getting

102
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,598
a pattern that is beginning to develop

103
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,039
now primary radial fractures so looking

104
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,719
at some of the options here when glass

105
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,120
breaks the fracture patterns

106
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,120
form on the surface breaks called

107
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,719
primary radial fractures are produced

108
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,080
those radial fractures we can see here

109
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,318
kind of like the points

110
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
that literally radiate outwards these

111
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,518
fractures start at the point of impact

112
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,000
and then radiate like spokes of a wheel

113
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,680
outward

114
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,039
from there that's we kind of see that

115
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
starburst effect

116
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,479
these radial fractures form on the side

117
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,039
opposite on the point

118
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,238
of impact we can see a great depiction

119
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,400
of them here

120
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,920
these kind of sideways ones here are

121
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,799
going to be the concentric fractures but

122
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,199
right now we're focusing

123
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,360
on those radial ones those kind of like

124
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,238
sunbeam ones

125
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
those can concentric fractures so those

126
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,599
next

127
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,878
kind of fractures that do occur as well

128
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,439
the radio ones we talked about those

129
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,280
lines

130
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,560
now we're looking at the ones kind of

131
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,280
going in a circle

132
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,719
and there are also secondary fractures

133
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,519
referred to as secondary fractures that

134
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,120
form

135
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,039
these fractures take the form of

136
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,080
concentric circles around the point of

137
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,280
impacts that's why sometimes they're

138
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,040
called concentric

139
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,598
they kind of have that ring kind of

140
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,280
appearance these concentric circles that

141
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,959
have the same center you can see them

142
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,719
also clearly evident here

143
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,640
these concentric circles with the same

144
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,400
side of the glass as the point of

145
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,318
impact so that's why it's important too

146
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,879
to try to make note of what

147
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,839
side of the glass if you can in

148
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,719
investigation

149
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,119
what side was the inside or the outside

150
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,240
there's the four rule for determining

151
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
the side of impact and after looking at

152
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,199
the

153
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,360
kind of catchy term here where ridge

154
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,000
lines on radial fractures

155
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
are at right angles to the rear with the

156
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
side opposite of the

157
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,720
impact and we can look see if we look

158
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,520
really closely you can see that

159
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,880
a fracture propagation direction here

160
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,879
now there are exceptions

161
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,240
to this rules there are sadly with many

162
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,719
rules the extensions

163
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,360
are tempered glass a dice is without

164
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,600
forming these

165
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
ridges because of the way that it's made

166
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,320
also very small windows held tightly in

167
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,639
a frame

168
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,560
that do not bend or bulge very much

169
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,478
those can kind of avoid this rule

170
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,079
windows broken by heat or an explosion

171
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,478
have really no point

172
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,959
of impact kind of not allowing this rule

173
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,800
to be applied to them

174
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,159
now if we have a bullet hole in glass

175
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
well this is where the projectile hits

176
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,280
the glass surface and the glass bends

177
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,360
and energy dispersing from the point

178
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,679
causes radial fractures to occur

179
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,960
on the side of glass opposite the point

180
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,560
of impact

181
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,239
and here's just a prime example here a

182
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,519
vertical piece of glass bullet traveling

183
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,079
from the left side to the right side and

184
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,240
what's going

185
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,839
on here the stress marks on the edges of

186
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,478
the radial fracture can

187
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,918
conform in a specific way which shows

188
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,800
the direction of the

189
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,599
impact stress marks are curved in this

190
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,520
case

191
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,360
on the one end of the curve runs

192
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,439
parallel to the glass surface the other

193
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,840
end of the curve runs perpendicular

194
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,839
to the glass so if we kind of see these

195
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,758
radial fractures indicated here

196
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,279
we also have these concentric fractures

197
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,879
here that's looking

198
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,399
straight on piece of glass take that

199
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,879
glass and turn it to the side

200
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,439
what we see though is located right over

201
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,680
on this side here

202
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,879
now object entry and exit points that

203
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
can be very important we're trying to

204
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,600
determine

205
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,680
whether the bullet came into the car or

206
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
out of the car waves of energy from the

207
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
projectile

208
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,079
reverberate from the point of impact

209
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,720
causing the glass to fracture in a cone

210
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,279
shape this side of glass that has stress

211
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,680
marks

212
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,559
which are parallel to the surface is the

213
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,680
side which

214
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,000
sustained the initial impact the result

215
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,360
is small entrance hole and a larger exit

216
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
hole in the glass if you're able to

217
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
compare

218
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
both sides surrounding the hole made by

219
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,638
the projectile there will be concentric

220
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,399
rings

221
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,319
known as the concentric fracture it's

222
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,560
really important to take a look at those

223
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
to be able to determine in this case

224
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,240
whether the bullet came

225
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,000
into the car or exited out of the car

226
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,160
through the glass

227
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,079
now successive penetrations of glass

228
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,680
here when there have been successful

229
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,359
penetrations of glass it's frequently

230
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,959
possible to determine the sequence of

231
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
impact by observing the existing

232
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,799
fracture lines

233
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,639
and their points of termination a

234
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,199
fracture always terminates at an

235
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,120
existing

236
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
line of fracture so this can kind of be

237
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,038
even important if we have

238
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,479
multiple bullet holes going into a piece

239
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,399
of glass trying to determine

240
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,000
which one was fired first which was the

241
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,719
first point of entry was

242
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
second third and so on can help then

243
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
determine the order

244
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,839
which can then help determine uh if we

245
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,839
look at the interior of a room

246
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,598
for example where we'd be looking for

247
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,159
bullets and where that kind of

248
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,120
person if they were shot or had a fatal

249
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,120
wound to them

250
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,038
what where they may have been placed and

251
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,160
what bullet caused that

252
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,918
sadly that death to potentially occur

253
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,199
now last we have breakage of glass from

254
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,240
fire as i mentioned this was a little

255
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,639
bit different

256
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,478
and we see an image of that right here

257
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,840
so during fire glass may break a result

258
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,159
of heat fracturing which

259
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,000
produces a different pattern and impact

260
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,199
wavy fracture lines develop in glass

261
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,439
that have been exposed to

262
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,840
high heat glass will tend to break

263
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,598
toward the region of higher temperature

264
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,598
and if the glass was not broken before

265
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,719
the fire there will be no radial or

266
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,560
concentric circle

267
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
fraction patterns in the glass that is

268
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,598
broken by very high heat

269
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,520
we kind of see that textured like look

270
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:02,560
to the pattern here of breakage of glass

271
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,799
during fire

272
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,319
and that can be very important for arson

273
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,160
determining where that fire may locate

274
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,240
the heat of that fire

275
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,080
but again that glass will be fractured

276
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,400
but it's going to have a very different

277
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,439
and characteristic look if it was a

278
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,519
result of heat

279
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,519
than if it was a result of impact
