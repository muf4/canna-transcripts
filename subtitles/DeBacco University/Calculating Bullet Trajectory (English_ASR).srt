1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,040
okay here i'm going to go over

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,278
calculating bullet trajectory

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,960
and also some of the factors to consider

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:07,599
the impact trajectory and run you

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,240
through one

6
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,439
mock example so first off when i say

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,919
there's many factors

8
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,759
here's just an example of some factors

9
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,399
that can be taken into consideration

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,719
this is an online kind of mathematical

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,399
graph calculator i should say

12
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,599
that will calculate some of these but

13
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,559
you want to be thinking about the drag

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,439
function

15
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,198
the way the the velocity of the shooting

16
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,719
angle the wind speed the wind angle as

17
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,000
things as well as the weather what is

18
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,839
the altitude what's the temperature

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,799
barometer pressure relative humidity

20
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,320
all these can impact the trajectory of

21
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,759
that bullet

22
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,600
this is just an example of the graph

23
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,679
generated based on that data it's a

24
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,760
22. we can see that kind of parabola

25
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,119
like angle of travel

26
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,839
here or path of travel now looking here

27
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,919
what i've done

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
is a comparison so on the left again we

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,160
see the 22

30
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,878
and the right here we see the 50 cal

31
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,718
now very similar kind of methods of

32
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,079
travel the shape it looks very similar

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
however when we look closer there are

34
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,400
some distinct differences

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,200
for example the initial velocity on the

36
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,560
22 is 1280 feet per second

37
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,680
we're on the 50 cal here it's 2 2820

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,359
feet per second

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,439
if you look closely at the numbers while

40
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,599
the shape it may look very similar

41
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,279
here we're kind of at dropping down

42
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,000
negative 20 feet

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
somewhere around you know about 400

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,719
yards

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,479
well here we reach the negative feet

46
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,118
we're looking we're about a thousand

47
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,679
yards so the distance of travel is

48
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,000
greatly

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
impacted and most factors are considered

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,840
to be the same

51
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,319
as far as environmental factors go but

52
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,320
again the bullet weight is only 40 grams

53
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,879
22 750 grams for the 50 cal so again

54
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,758
this is just an example of great

55
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,478
differences

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,000
that can occur even though the general

57
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,560
path or the general shape of the path

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,759
may be the same now getting into this

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,439
trajectory

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,439
two reference points are needed to

61
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,599
define the trajectory of a bullet

62
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,639
the path the bullet travels so here

63
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,239
we're going to be looking at the

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,159
impact of a bullet with a passenger or a

65
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,840
driver in this case of a car

66
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,598
i'm coming through the windshield and

67
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,159
impacting here

68
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,598
so as i said two reference points are

69
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,479
needed now how do you go about getting

70
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,000
those points

71
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,598
well if you look at the way that the

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,878
hole is made and you can kind of develop

73
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,519
a line

74
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,199
that is a great way to get those two

75
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,920
reference points especially if it passes

76
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,719
through

77
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,439
two areas these reference points can be

78
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,519
bullet holes

79
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,878
in the object or the victim and the

80
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,680
entry point or exit point from the

81
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,598
victim can be

82
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
used so if it came in one way and went

83
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,318
out the other way those again

84
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
can be two points if it came in the

85
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,359
windshield impacted the person

86
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,959
those can be also considered two points

87
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,519
gunshot residue or spent cartridge

88
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,759
casings can be less specific

89
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,959
reference points but still as an option

90
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,439
investigators can use

91
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,120
lasers to trace a straight line path to

92
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,680
help determine the position of the

93
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
shooter

94
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
and that's what we're going to be

95
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,878
calculating here now when we're looking

96
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,319
at calculation this is going to be a

97
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,518
simplified version

98
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,719
we're looking at a um impact uh with a

99
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,080
driver

100
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,800
and we have the path of bullet we have

101
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,159
the windshield we have the building

102
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,599
60 feet away or 720 inches away the

103
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,679
distance from the window to the bullet

104
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,039
is 23.9 inches

105
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,879
horizontal distance from the window to

106
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,318
the bullet entrance point is 23.5 inches

107
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,798
so let's kind of zoom in and take a look

108
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,280
at this basically looking at triangles

109
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,640
so what we know the distance along the

110
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,759
horizontal

111
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,119
to the window was 23 and a half inches

112
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,919
we have the distance along the path of

113
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,959
the bullet window was 23.9 inches this

114
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,518
makes this little right

115
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,479
triangle we know the building is 720

116
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,200
inches away and

117
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,878
the distance was converted to inches to

118
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,479
keep all the units the same

119
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,239
what we want to know is c is the

120
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,919
distance from here

121
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
all the way to here what is the distance

122
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,399
from the shooter to the bullet

123
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,599
entrance point so how do we go about

124
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,280
calculating that

125
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,318
we kind of have the two sides of this

126
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,759
triangle that's going to be very

127
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,479
important

128
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:08,759
so we take those two sides and we've got

129
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:12,798
23.9 over

130
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:16,358
23.5 is the same as or proportional to

131
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,199
the distance of c this distance over

132
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:22,638
720 so this allows us now

133
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,280
through to calculate what c is so we go

134
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,240
through

135
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,000
720 times 23.9 divided by 23 and a half

136
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,560
we'll go to c

137
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,639
and c is determined to be 732.3

138
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,478
inches so what we want to figure out now

139
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,439
we have this distance i want to hear

140
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,599
what the height of the

141
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,478
shooter is we're looking for this side

142
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,439
of this larger triangle and we're going

143
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,359
to go back to

144
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,120
we may remember way back when when you

145
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
use the pythagorean theorem

146
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,639
a squared plus b squared equals c

147
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,560
squared to determine this because this

148
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,800
is a right triangle

149
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,160
now kathleen bullet trajectory what's

150
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,919
the height of the shooter well here's

151
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
our distance now here's our building

152
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:00,719
distance

153
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,079
we're going to simply go through and

154
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,000
calculate

155
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,758
a squared plus b squared equals c

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,120
squared what we're looking to find is b

157
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,120
squared so we've got 720 squared

158
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
plus what's going to be b squared is

159
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,000
going to equal 732.3

160
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,759
squared so let's go through and

161
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,959
calculate that out

162
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,800
go through we add those we square those

163
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,000
then we subtract those two we get b

164
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,160
squared this distance

165
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,360
squared equals 1 17 900.

166
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,240
we go through and take the square root

167
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,600
of that and b will be 133 inches

168
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,120
so what's the height of the shooter for

169
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,120
b well it would be 833 inches
