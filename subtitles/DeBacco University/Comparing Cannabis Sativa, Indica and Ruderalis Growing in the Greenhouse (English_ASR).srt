1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,220
and this debaco University video we're

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,318
going to compare Cannabis sativa indica

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:10,199
and Rooter Alice growing in the

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,900
greenhouse so you can see exactly the

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:17,239
differences despite them being grown in

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,240
relatively the same exact conditions

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,260
[Music]

8
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:26,640
now we're going to be looking at a

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,080
greenhouse comparison of the different

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,820
morphologies of these three different

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,618
types now they're growing in the same

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,539
Greenhouse under the same conditions and

13
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,840
Connor will be showing us how different

14
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:39,299
Indica sativa and ruderalis plants can

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,520
look remember the key difference is the

16
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,859
plant growth morphologies as these terms

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,200
do not match any particular effects as

18
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:49,859
you may see advertised at a dispensary

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,539
we're looking at the sativa indica or

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,280
ruderalis it's really more for the

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,160
grower to understand the morphologies

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,859
and how to best utilize those so first

23
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,939
off the sativas just in general here we

24
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,260
can see them clearly known for their get

25
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,518
very tall it should be a warning to

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,618
Growers looking at planting a true

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,840
sativa they can get quite tall in the

28
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,640
vegetative state these plants can be

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680
already 10 feet tall as we'll see in the

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,379
greenhouse they're really not into heavy

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,000
flowering yet either this is okay in the

32
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,679
greenhouse setting simply because wind

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,019
is not an issue compared to Growing

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,060
Outdoors but the daily management of

35
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:27,239
these plants can present challenges now

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,379
not to mention the Harvest at the end of

37
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,019
the season

38
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,938
then we get to our indicas which are

39
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,340
generally a middle growth pattern

40
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:38,219
compared to the sativism ruderalis that

41
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,340
we'll say these tend to be more tame and

42
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,959
in the less aggressive of growth but we

43
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,180
can see here it's kind of showing they

44
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,399
still can get pretty tall they're

45
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,079
indicative of their wider leaves can

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,640
make them slightly more susceptible to

47
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,758
Leaf damage compared to the thinner

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,618
leaves of a sativa

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,180
then we get to the autoflowers or the

50
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:58,859
root Alice you can see kind of showing

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,840
the approximate height there and these

52
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,179
are autoflowers and while not originally

53
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,859
thought to be

54
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,299
autoflowers in the case for these plants

55
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,038
in the greenhouse they're certainly an

56
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,500
auto trait in the lineage they were not

57
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,179
purchased originally to be an Autoflower

58
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,280
but it offers a nice comparison here

59
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,819
these are great for winter growing in a

60
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,739
greenhouse or a tent or a way that you

61
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,000
know you can stagger your Harvest there

62
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,159
because they're going to flower based on

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,739
days old not dependent on the photo

64
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,000
period however in this case we're during

65
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,039
the peak growing months of the year

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,979
giving them a prime Greenhouse floor

67
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,799
space can be a bit of waste due to their

68
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,659
small size we can kind of see the areas

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,040
here of the floor that are kind of not

70
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:39,959
being covered because they weren't

71
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:41,280
anticipated to be an Autoflower the

72
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,780
slight Advantage is that there will be

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
harvested and removed ahead of the other

74
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,199
plants spacing out the Harvest process

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,300
so reducing or staggering some of that

76
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,560
labor now if this was known to if these

77
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,120
were known to be autoflowers when they

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,680
originally purchased planting them

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,840
earlier would have been advised so that

80
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,640
two crops could be harvested in the same

81
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,500
year essentially doubling the yields per

82
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,039
area and compensating for their small

83
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,419
basically half or even less plant size

84
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,859
so now we're going to go out to Connor

85
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,539
here in the greenhouse and Connor's

86
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,099
going to show us what is growing the

87
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,539
greenhouse to point out the distinctive

88
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:12,000
morphologies of the different

89
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,560
classifications of these cannabis plants

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,598
enjoy

91
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,098
how are we doing everybody we are back

92
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,439
here in the greenhouse

93
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,479
and in front of me you see a lot of

94
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,239
plants that are in flour you can see

95
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,959
some nugs some buds forming

96
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,780
um

97
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,860
which is a little weird because if you

98
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,479
look behind me

99
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,140
you see a bunch of plants that are

100
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,340
almost 10 feet tall 12 feet tall fully

101
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,439
in vegged still

102
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,539
and so what we believe with this variety

103
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,479
are CBG white variety

104
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:45,239
we think that there's an Autoflower

105
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,179
genetics somewhere deep in the lineage

106
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,640
that has caused us to

107
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,379
see this early flowering compared to

108
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,199
these other varieties

109
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:57,719
this plant only grows up to about maybe

110
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,419
four feet tall three feet

111
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,759
um and it's it's been budding now for

112
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:05,699
probably about three weeks

113
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:08,459
compared to behind me near the fan

114
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:11,158
you can see these large behemoths that

115
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,620
are fully in veg with very little signs

116
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:14,400
of flour beginning

117
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,079
um

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,579
another interesting note

119
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,319
behind that fan you can see how tall

120
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,540
those plants are they're almost reaching

121
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:25,439
the top of the greenhouse that is our

122
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:30,120
sativa dominant CBD variety it is

123
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:33,300
actually cbdv forbidden the strain

124
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,978
um and to the to the left of that right

125
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,439
where that pole kind of splits off you

126
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:39,959
can see it our Indica dominant some Sour

127
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,939
lifter CBD strain and so you can really

128
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:45,239
see the difference in the height

129
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:48,418
and how the leaves are a lot thinner on

130
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,759
the sativas compared to the indica

131
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,099
um however in this

132
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,620
ruderalis Autoflower strain in front of

133
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,379
me you're really not seeing that those

134
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,939
wide fan leaves or those large families

135
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:01,259
you're seeing more of these sugar leaves

136
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:03,199
these smaller

137
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:07,080
flowering leaves

138
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:11,400
and while this may be wanted in say a

139
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,899
tent or a small confined space in a

140
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,399
greenhouse like this we really do have

141
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,439
the space too

142
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,359
to grow these behemoths in these huge

143
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,279
sativas

144
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,100
um but if you're going for yourself in a

145
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,079
small tent at home an Autoflower such as

146
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,520
this CBG white strain would be perfect

147
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,219
because they would fit

148
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,839
right within a two by two tent and you

149
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,979
would get nice yield

150
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,839
and you wouldn't really have to worry

151
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:36,599
about too much defoliating or topping

152
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,239
when compared to dealing with a photo

153
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,400
dependent sativa strain

154
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,379
you're gonna have a lot of work on your

155
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,638
hands

156
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,918
but yeah you can really see the

157
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,180
difference in a consistent environment

158
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:53,339
here and ruderalis sativa and indica and

159
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,879
how different they grow under the same

160
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,879
conditions
