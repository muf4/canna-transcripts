1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,418
okay here we go over the proper

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,759
pipetting procedure and while there may

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:09,570
be different types of pipettes the basic

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,460
procedure holds true for them all so

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,469
piping could be the most important lab

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,139
technique to master so take time to

7
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,399
learn how to do this properly the reason

8
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:18,899
why is it the most important technique

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,269
to master is you're already dealing with

10
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,309
small quantities so small variations can

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,579
have a dramatic impact on your end

12
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:28,379
result so take the time to go over work

13
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,839
with this it's gonna seem easy the first

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,368
time but keep it at it so you can really

15
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,280
refine it and reduce the chance for

16
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:38,100
errors the journal schematic here of a

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,260
pipette Gilson was used because that's

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,270
what I could find online the template is

19
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,009
generally common to all pipettes you

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,870
want to be fairly the specific mantle of

21
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:47,579
the pipette you might be doing and your

22
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,378
replacements list for the model if you

23
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,780
have opted ensure you're getting

24
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,549
everything I create because again we're

25
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,799
looking at small variations making large

26
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:58,229
potential effects and there are Springs

27
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,089
and seals in them so again these are

28
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:02,759
things that can wear out over time so

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,430
just keep that in mind if you are

30
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,868
working in a lab I know pipettes can be

31
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,040
expensive to purchase but if you're

32
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:09,840
going to be working in that lab I would

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,299
recommend you get your own personal set

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,070
of pipettes to use now while they are

35
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,540
expensive even to initially purchase you

36
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,548
want to go the extra step of getting

37
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,030
them calibrated and keep them to

38
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,259
yourselves that this sounds selfish but

39
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,478
because these small variations can make

40
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,340
a large change you want to make sure to

41
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,048
have an accurate set so that your lab

42
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,299
data has the most accurate and

43
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,950
consistent it's possible to reduce the

44
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,650
potential for a long range work that you

45
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,960
have to do it or redo an experiment now

46
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,060
when pipetting the number one reason for

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,009
errors is actually distractions so you

48
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,659
want to be sure that you're kind of

49
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,409
focused on what you're doing and avoid

50
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,210
distractions

51
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,219
your attitude is important if you're

52
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,929
angry moving fast and you know not

53
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,209
following the proper procedure that's

54
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,310
going to cause skewing of the results as

55
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,929
well you need to ensure you're slowing

56
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,000
down and taking your time because

57
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,140
rushing will equal mistakes it just kind

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,688
of rush through his I have to do all

59
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,070
this and just get through it quick it

60
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,389
would be advised not to do it at that

61
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,269
time because again you could be

62
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,300
inserting more errors in the end the

63
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,859
basics of pipetting houses typically

64
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,950
they can be held in the left or right

65
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,239
hand the plunger has two stops so a pee

66
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:16,919
when you push it down with your thumb

67
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,930
you're gonna reach off you're gonna feel

68
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,958
first up and then push even further

69
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,390
gonna feel second stop so the first stop

70
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,550
is the amount of volume stated on the

71
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:29,039
pipette this will dispense the correct

72
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,219
amount of liquid so what you would do is

73
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,810
you take your pipette if you're going to

74
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:35,489
take up a certain amount of liquid you

75
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,949
die press that pipette you put it in the

76
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,920
liquid to depress it to the first stop

77
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:43,378
put it in the liquid and then release it

78
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,639
slowly and you take up that liquid you

79
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:46,590
have to dispense it into another

80
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,689
container you're gonna push down and

81
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,310
feel that first stop just about all the

82
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:52,409
liquid will be dispensed if you want to

83
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,299
go on to the final and next stop and

84
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,219
they'll add a little bit extra air you

85
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,890
know ensure that there's nothing left in

86
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,479
the pipette tip is that second stop is

87
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,309
that extra help dispense that liquid and

88
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,169
I'm gonna let it return to its normal

89
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,579
position so when you go through and you

90
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,609
feel this is you'll that first step in

91
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:10,290
second stop that first stop or the end

92
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,480
result here to that first stop will be

93
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:14,310
the amount that is stated on the pipette

94
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,229
but there will be a second staff that

95
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,659
will push a little extra air out this is

96
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:20,699
why for being aggressive you can push

97
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:25,409
down beyond that first stop and take it

98
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:27,659
more liquid and not properly assess the

99
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:30,030
reading that's on the pipette and it'll

100
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,969
be causing a massive skew in your

101
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,620
results first step is to select the

102
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:36,659
correct pipette so it might send other

103
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,799
all pipettes aren't they the illicit

104
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,620
tips and these are different and that's

105
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,639
because there are four different amounts

106
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,340
select the one that's closest to your

107
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,500
target value whether it's a larger a mid

108
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,889
or a small volume so let the right

109
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,930
pipette if you have that option because

110
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:53,969
while you saying oh listen can do both

111
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,060
they may not do it as well or as

112
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:58,560
accurately step two is to set the knob

113
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,939
properly in the sort of that amount when

114
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,219
you're setting that the pipette knob

115
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,780
will actually rotate in turn I know the

116
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,180
volume the peph it's used in the scale

117
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,709
so you're able to dial this in correctly

118
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,659
a lot of them will say exactly what they

119
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,939
are this measures 10 to 100 microliters

120
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,859
this matters to 100 to 1000 microliters

121
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,969
so just be aware when you're grabbing

122
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:20,189
and set it properly

123
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,660
step 3 have the tips in easy to reach

124
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:23,490
area these really the tips because

125
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,680
you'll be using a new one each time you

126
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,360
go through a chance for the liquid make

127
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,810
sure they're an arm's reach out and out

128
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,250
of the way

129
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,079
the experiment but still close enough

130
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,819
that you're able to use them this

131
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,199
robotic arm here and all the pipette

132
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,719
tips are located really close and the

133
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,259
different pets are here so you want them

134
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,660
close but not necessarily in the way

135
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,069
lastly you want a pipette slowly avoid

136
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,439
the creation of bubbles so this will

137
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:48,360
cause volumes to be inaccurate so you

138
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,418
want to allow it to be taken up slowly

139
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,129
and dispensed slowly again this pipette

140
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:55,319
is a little filter tip as well so this

141
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:56,689
is another level sometimes they will

142
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,980
have that something won't have that

143
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:01,079
regardless if you're using the filter

144
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,220
one of the extra cautious of them slowly

145
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,228
because that air does have to pass

146
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,790
through that filter but you want to

147
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:07,228
ensure that you're as accurate as

148
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,050
possible cuz you're gonna be peeing this

149
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:12,620
again and again so only that was helpful

150
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,240
on going through the basics of a pipette

151
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,829
that when you go and grab one you'll be

152
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,540
at least initially familiar with it and

153
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:21,769
then the key part there is simply just

154
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,770
keep practicing with it
