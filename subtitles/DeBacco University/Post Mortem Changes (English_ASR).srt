1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
so this tobacco university video is

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,398
going to be looking at the post-mortem

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,120
changes and due to some of the images

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,519
used

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,559
viewer discretion is advised proceeding

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,880
forward

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,959
so the post-modern interval is looking

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,560
at post-mortem changes that refer to

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,560
changes in the decomposition occurring

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,439
in the human body after death

11
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,839
the postmodern interval pmi is the time

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,320
it

13
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,118
has elapsed since death this may be

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,839
estimated

15
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:31,518
when it is not known from such changes

16
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,840
using medical or scientific techniques

17
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,119
now pallor mortis here what we're

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,280
noticing

19
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,878
is a paleness evident in individuals

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,079
with light to white skin

21
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,280
almost instantly in the 15 to 25 minutes

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,878
after death

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,399
because of the lack of capillary

24
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,039
circulation throughout the body

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,558
so the fairer skin person is definitely

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,920
going to show this visually

27
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,679
to a much greater extent in relatively

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,439
short order 15 to 20 minutes

29
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,920
after death they have algor mortis here

30
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,920
and this is deathy and referring to the

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,359
cooling of the body after death

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
forensic investigators will take the

33
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,879
temperature from the liver this is a

34
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,798
very internal organ so it tends to be

35
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,199
very stable in temperature

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,118
and cool at a very consistent rate the

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,439
body cools at a rate of about 1.4

38
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:20,159
degrees per hour immediately after death

39
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,679
and then slows to 0.7 degrees per hour

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,840
after about 12 hours

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
until it reaches the same temperature as

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,520
the environment

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,280
and here we see the hours after death

44
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,920
and then here we see the core

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,560
body temperature keeping in mind these

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,600
are in

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,000
degrees celsius going on to rigor

48
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,599
mortis this is death stiffness this

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,078
occurs because skeletal muscles will

50
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,640
stiffen

51
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,199
after death this is a lack of oxygen in

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
the cells

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,040
result in calcium buildup in the muscles

54
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,600
resulting in the stiffening

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,118
rigor morris becomes apparent in the

56
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,879
eyelids and jaws of the victim and

57
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,519
spreads throughout the entire body

58
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,399
approximately 6 to 12 hours before

59
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,599
receding again

60
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,280
after another 6 to 12 hours so it

61
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,199
doesn't last forever

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,399
the dead body that is not stiff has

63
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,118
probably either been dead

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
less than 2 hours or more than 48 hours

65
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,959
to try to provide

66
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,879
that time of death estimation here based

67
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,920
on the presence or absence of rigor

68
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,039
mortis now with liver mortis which is

69
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,759
the discoloration

70
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,679
of dependent parts of the body it's the

71
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,079
result of pooling of blood and tissues

72
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
after

73
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
death the red blood cells break

74
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,878
releasing hemoglobin and turning a

75
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
purple color

76
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,639
this begins about 20 minutes after death

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
and reaches a maximum

78
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,479
of 6 to 12 hours with the final

79
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,000
discoloration being permanent

80
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,399
between 2 and eight hours after death

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,239
the skin will disappear uh when the skin

82
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
is pressed on so again that can help

83
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,000
determine uh potentially how long

84
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,760
someone has died it also helps us

85
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,519
determine the position so here this

86
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,878
person has passed away in what we call

87
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,400
the supine position lying on their back

88
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,000
they have putrification and this is the

89
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,319
breakdown of proteins and

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,598
liquefication of most organs the exact

91
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,919
rate of this process

92
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,518
is dependent on many factors to consider

93
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,878
especially if they died outside this

94
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,439
could be weather

95
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,878
exposure to either extreme temperatures

96
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,158
or reduced temperatures

97
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,000
location simply though consider that

98
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,318
warmer temperatures will equal faster

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,919
rate of decomposition so take that into

100
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,518
consideration we're trying to estimate

101
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,598
the time

102
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,280
that decomposition time is that process

103
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,039
by which the organic substances are

104
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,318
broken down into simpler forms of

105
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,919
organic matter

106
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,199
and this occurs as we've seen many

107
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,119
things there's the apple that fell down

108
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,518
it's decomposing breaking down

109
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,120
recently dyed snake and the ants are

110
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,280
speeding that process along

111
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
of the decomposition that going kind of

112
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,280
back to the earth

113
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,440
lastly we have the skeletalization

114
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,680
process and this is completed when all

115
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,959
soft tissue will have been eliminated

116
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,360
leaving only

117
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,280
basically the bones that are left and we

118
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,959
see here the animal here

119
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,199
coming close to that skeletalization

120
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,080
process losing all the muscle of the

121
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,560
organs

122
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,760
all the skin we see some hair left but

123
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,438
just kind of getting into a

124
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,840
skeletalization would apply

125
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,719
getting to just having the skeleton

126
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,719
remaining
