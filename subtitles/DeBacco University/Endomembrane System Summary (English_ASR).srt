1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
now you might be looking at this image

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,278
going how can this be a summary of the

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,759
endomembrane system

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,800
uh it looks very complex well there's a

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,559
lot of things going on i'm going to

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,360
attempt to kind of go over the main

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:12,798
points

8
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,480
you're going to see a theme here we

9
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,759
start in the nucleus and we kind of work

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
our way through the

11
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,760
rough and smooth er we have transport

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,679
vesicles and then go to the golgi

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,118
ultimately forming these vesicles that

14
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,079
will then leave

15
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,879
the cell in this example here or enter

16
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,239
the cell

17
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,320
in this regards where we're having

18
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,640
enzymes break some of those things down

19
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,079
so this whole system is just a way that

20
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
the nucleus containing its

21
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,160
dna can help regulate process for

22
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,078
things being secreted from the cell or

23
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,919
things being broken down that enter

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,359
the cell so let's now look into a little

25
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,520
more detail

26
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,200
well again here's that nucleus starting

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,280
there we have our rough er

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
from those vesicles going to our golgi

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,359
and going to the cell membrane

30
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:58,238
this is a very simplified version of

31
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,679
what we just saw in the previous image

32
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,599
here's a little bit more complex with

33
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,679
all kind of the parts labeled and kind

34
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,118
of broken down we have our nuclear

35
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,879
membrane we have our pores remember

36
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,000
those are regulated we have our rough

37
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,839
er our smooth er

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,478
we have these kind of vesicles being

39
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,359
attached as vesicles being released and

40
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,438
being kind of

41
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,118
going through this modification process

42
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,000
through the golgi which is located in

43
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:21,680
this region

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,159
we have things entering on one side of

45
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,920
the golgi exiting out the other

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,759
and ultimately going to come in contact

47
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,840
in this case with the cell membrane

48
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,079
and then going to be secreted outside to

49
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,359
the exterior environment

50
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,279
so again just kind of gives you a little

51
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,319
bit of a breakdown of the different

52
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,680
components

53
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,719
involved with this process now the er

54
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,118
and the golgi are going to be two years

55
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,759
we're going to spend a little time with

56
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,879
this is a modification of proteins and

57
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,799
lipids as well

58
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,959
here's our nucleus here's our rough er

59
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,360
and then here's our golgi

60
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,798
this is going to receive vesicles from

61
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,640
the er and the cysts or

62
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,640
interface so the golgi is going to

63
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,280
receive those transport vesicles

64
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,759
from our rough er on the cis face here

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,879
then

66
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,000
we have some carbohydrates being added

67
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,000
and taking place

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,360
we have this kind of packaging and

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,598
processing

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,760
of these vesicles and prepares them for

71
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,959
shipment out to vesicles and other

72
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,399
trans or outer face here so we kind of

73
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,000
have this kind of process here which i

74
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
won't go into the great detail

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,280
this golgi where it's packaging and

76
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,439
processing these proteins

77
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,959
these vesicles ultimately containing the

78
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,840
process proteins will bud

79
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,800
off and in this example are going to the

80
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,800
be attached

81
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,040
to the exterior of the cell on the

82
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
plasma membrane so the golgi apparatus

83
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,439
is a series of flattened membrane

84
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,879
components called

85
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,959
cisternae or sacs this cyst is the near

86
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,878
the er and fuses with the er vesicles

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,759
remember er is referring to endoplasmic

88
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,598
reticulum

89
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,359
the medials the middle components and in

90
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,000
the trans is where it buds off so in

91
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
this example

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,280
the nucleus would be about where i'm

93
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,119
located

94
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,479
and then enter the cis space go through

95
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,840
its modification and then

96
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,399
exit out the trans face here

97
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,920
now the summary of the golgi again the

98
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,239
shipping and receiving center

99
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,280
for cellular products many transport

100
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,719
vesicles from the er

101
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,120
travel to the golgi operas for a

102
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,680
modification the center of manufacture

103
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
storing

104
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,599
and shipping these flattened membrane

105
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,239
sacs look like a pack of

106
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,359
like pita bread it's a very high surface

107
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,519
area to volume

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,800
ratio the golgi starts and packages

109
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,360
materials for transport

110
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,840
vesicles to be released outside of the

111
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,599
cell

112
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,479
or kind of moved to a different location

113
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,119
the golgi apparatus itself in action

114
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,079
here

115
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,920
we can kind of see the butting off and

116
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
in this case kind of the exiting out of

117
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,399
the cell

118
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,158
where here we're kind of having this

119
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,080
receiving end here

120
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,079
this binding or this membrane kind of

121
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,560
binding that's occurring as well so

122
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
again

123
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,959
many different end results but the same

124
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,439
basic process where we're having this

125
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,360
kind of

126
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,079
butting off and this kind of vesicles

127
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,319
formed for transportation

128
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,159
now we also have like lysosomes which

129
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,839
are vesicles containing digestive

130
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,798
enzymes that break down food and foreign

131
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,719
particles

132
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,480
they're membrane-bound vesicles but

133
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,479
they're not found in plants

134
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,318
they are produced by the golgi apparatus

135
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,158
and they can contain powerful digestive

136
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,359
enzymes that are highly acidic

137
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,120
so we think about acidic we think about

138
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,239
our lemons being very acidic it's

139
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,358
helping the breakdown

140
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,399
process the digestion of large molecules

141
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,799
into smaller ones

142
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,918
or breaking down or recycling cellular

143
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
resources

144
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,439
apoptosis program cell death it's like a

145
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,478
tadpole losing its tail

146
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,000
also kind of involved with this process

147
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,599
um there's some genetic diseases with

148
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,319
lysosomes tay sachs disease in

149
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
particular

150
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,000
is caused by a defect in lysosomal

151
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,399
activity

152
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,360
so they do have more components than

153
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,319
simply just

154
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,240
containing proteins or enzymes this

155
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,159
endomembrane system summary

156
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,439
those proteins produced in the rough er

157
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,880
and lipids

158
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,199
from the smoothie are carried to the

159
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,719
golgi apparatus and then the golgi

160
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,520
modifies those and kind of like

161
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
finalizes

162
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,240
and packages them into vesicles and then

163
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,799
allows them to carry on to their final

164
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
destination these secretory vesicles

165
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,478
carry out

166
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,360
products to the membrane where

167
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,959
exocytosis produces secretions

168
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,400
lysosomes fuse with the incoming

169
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,120
vesicles and digest

170
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,079
those macro molecules now our

171
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
endomembrane system

172
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,359
kind of that visual summary kind of

173
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,639
taking me back to one of those previous

174
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,319
images that i showed you

175
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,079
you can see the reason why everything is

176
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,038
kind of stacked and organized the way

177
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,038
that it is

178
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,159
is to allow for efficient transportation

179
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,759
of our dna

180
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,840
going to our proteins being made in the

181
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,439
ribosomes on the rough er modified with

182
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,359
some lipids from the smoothie are

183
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,759
kind of finely packaged and processed in

184
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,400
the golgi released in vesicles to their

185
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,199
final

186
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,198
location
