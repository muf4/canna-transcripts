1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,459
okay I'll get managing weeds which no

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:09,150
matter of the year the weather or the

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:11,429
location I can say that the weeds they

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,240
will grow this seems like it's

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:17,579
consistent ear to hear even in the

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,710
smallest and tiniest of places or you

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,599
don't even want something to grow seem

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,368
like they grow just fine and we have a

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,289
whole plethora of tools we try to do

10
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,660
combat them I'm gonna go over some of

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,609
them here so first off it's important

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,170
identify what type of wheat species

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,120
you're dealing with this can really help

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,939
with the control process but it's in the

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:39,269
Aster family okay crabgrass daisy family

16
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,920
here at gal saga all of these different

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,040
types have different ways we can address

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,170
them to best combat them so

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,679
identification is an important first

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,109
step so awesome growers choose to deal

21
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,609
with it is just mow them high tells me

22
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,229
limit the use of large equipment this is

23
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,329
not ideal but it does get the job done

24
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,729
you want to be careful on the more that

25
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,980
you choose here they'll be throwing the

26
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,869
debris out to the right hand side that

27
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,969
could be damaging your crops going down

28
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,069
here a mulching head would be better

29
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,560
because it doesn't throw them in a

30
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,889
direction again nothing to say the best

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,960
but it does get the job done

32
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,390
ideal we're looking at reducing weeds we

33
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,849
want to keep our tunnels clean and it

34
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,310
takes time and initially it takes some

35
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:26,099
money to be able to do this laying down

36
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,409
some fabric material here that does let

37
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:32,699
water through punching the holes very

38
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,290
precise inconsistent spacings to allow

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,329
our crops to be as efficient as possible

40
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,700
but you can see this does reduce the

41
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,349
weeds does reduce the timing season can

42
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,868
get a very clean look can help with a

43
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:45,089
lot of things overall during the season

44
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:46,828
this is a great way to approach it and

45
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,299
again these are high tunnels but then

46
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:51,328
also the same idea can be applied to

47
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,149
field grown crops mechanical mowing

48
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,188
mowing an intended or planted cover crop

49
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,019
can helps hold soil together and still

50
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:00,239
allow for water to infiltrate through

51
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:03,780
without any residual material at the end

52
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,489
of the season such as plastic it's gonna

53
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,680
be it difficult to initially get the in

54
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:10,019
between row cover established here and

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,300
here but once established those offer a

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,930
lot of benefits in that regards see

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,239
plastic is still being used for

58
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,120
main crop but the area here at noon with

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,650
that soil not dealing with that mud that

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,230
could develop just simply mowing this

61
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,480
and have nice clean covers you could see

62
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:27,968
it can work with plasticulture it can

63
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:31,090
work with row covers and it can work on

64
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:33,068
the large scale using that plastic mulch

65
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,489
layer see here if you haven't used once

66
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:38,018
is the type of equipment that requires

67
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,938
typically a decent size tractor

68
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:42,629
depending on the mulch layer depend what

69
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:45,218
you're pulling in depending on your soil

70
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:47,828
typically need a minimum 30 to 40

71
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:49,810
horsepower to be effective and you want

72
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:51,909
to use one mill embossed plastic is

73
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,650
recommended because that reduces tearing

74
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:55,358
velocity my do is get halfway down your

75
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,030
field to have this tear and after repair

76
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,530
or the wind catches it calls all sorts

77
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,389
of issues

78
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,949
so again specialized equipment here but

79
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,560
it does offer some advantages if you

80
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:07,388
have the right equipment that physical

81
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,979
barrier could see here here's our onion

82
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:11,169
plants and then here's that same

83
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:12,968
material we saw in the high tunnel or

84
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:15,129
can be used in greenhouse keeps the

85
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:16,870
walking paths clean and even eliminates

86
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:20,018
a transfer of soil by workers from field

87
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,359
to field so that's two advantages soil

88
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,408
borne diseases are a big issue and if

89
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,709
you have one field that's contaminated

90
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:28,209
it's very easy for workers or even

91
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,639
yourself to walk in the field and

92
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,079
transfer it over to another field here

93
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,449
creating a little bit more of a barrier

94
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,579
reducing the chance that occurs these

95
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,049
are expensive and there's always the

96
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:39,549
weed edges you see here and here there

97
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,169
are some still weeds that do developed

98
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:44,949
it on a hundred percent but they do

99
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:46,540
reduce it significantly in more than

100
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:48,549
loosing between rows if you can cover an

101
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:50,709
entire field got to watch the wind and

102
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,409
set up and during so you don't want it

103
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,259
to cut or damage your new transplants

104
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:58,418
here we have a place that vine let's

105
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:59,948
grow over here we have some al could be

106
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,229
watermelons there could be some squash

107
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:07,209
plans that are gonna find out melons in

108
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:09,040
general here no weeds clean clean fruit

109
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,650
makes it easy to harvest you only have

110
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,568
your own crop there a lot of damages

111
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,819
keep in mind though that mice do like

112
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:17,228
this area to kind of live in on is why

113
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:20,348
is to wrap this up at the end of the

114
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:21,939
season place sandbags in season to help

115
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:23,228
hold it down at the end the season to

116
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:24,870
make sure you wrap it up and store it

117
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:27,759
outside of the field

118
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,439
onions to reduce weeds and trips

119
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,439
I save just grant onions in reflective

120
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,079
or silver plastic mulch as we see here

121
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,420
silver is not necessary same as gray you

122
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,159
want reflective shiny bright

123
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,500
what's that students that confuses some

124
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,320
of the insects which way the Sun is it

125
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,920
can help reduce your pressure in

126
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,540
particularly with onions also helps

127
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,129
reduce the weeds you might think well

128
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,230
with onions I'm punching a lot of holes

129
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:55,449
right for all my individual plants

130
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,150
that's true but there's still benefits

131
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:00,639
offered so again I still recommend it if

132
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:03,639
you're planting onions and doing them in

133
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,629
rows a you plan on on this silver or

134
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,479
reflective mulch can really save a lot

135
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:12,180
with insect pressure later in the season

136
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:16,000
with any plastic whether it's silver or

137
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,949
brown or black or red or any other color

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,139
that they offer Fields cleanup is

139
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,149
important that's time consuming and you

140
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:24,490
have to find a way to dispose of that

141
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:25,629
material so again with everything and

142
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,009
every Pro there's a con

143
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:29,230
someday consider when we're doing

144
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:31,360
plasticulture we need to find a way to

145
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,390
dispose of this and we need to take the

146
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,860
time didn't remove that from our fields

147
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,120
some people use mulch between rows once

148
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,699
established it can offer many benefits

149
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,889
of manufacturing we block now it's often

150
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:44,110
hard to get them mulch to do all the

151
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:47,259
rows a lot of area it can be

152
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,670
time-consuming to apply and Grossman's

153
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:52,060
get round bales to kind of try to roll

154
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,100
them out I can use initially but good in

155
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,259
between rows in between plants and once

156
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,850
established great but can be

157
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,610
time-consuming to get this all neat and

158
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,040
orderly there's also a chemical control

159
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,330
options such as herbicides many options

160
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,580
certain chemistry's have longer lasting

161
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:08,199
effects than others be sure to protect

162
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:11,079
the main crop so going down and spraying

163
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:13,199
between rows here we see no problem but

164
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,269
you notice on this setup here we have

165
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,099
barriers so the nozzles that spring here

166
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:19,629
killing our weeds in between rows it's

167
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,210
not going to drift over and kill our

168
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:24,009
main crop verba cisors different

169
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:26,039
chemistry is to match the application

170
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:28,029
they can be very effective some of

171
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,520
residuals and it can be concerned about

172
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:34,989
drift but if used effectively as we see

173
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:37,629
here very efficient kill very directed

174
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,160
only in the area we want it and not here

175
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,180
and see these crops are doing just fine

176
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,620
without the competition

177
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,939
quick to apply over large areas or you

178
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,139
can even spot straighter besides you

179
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,079
don't have to do the whole field you can

180
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,310
use one area here but if you miss an

181
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,729
area you're gonna know it because it

182
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,930
shows how specific herbicides can be so

183
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,759
a lot of times herbicides oh they're

184
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,530
horrible and I kill the whole crop well

185
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,409
we can really see how effective they can

186
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:03,089
be and in here in a large-scale

187
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,740
application that gorgeous mist that

188
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,709
little thin strip there you could see

189
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,420
those plants are doing just fine again

190
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:11,989
herbicides dual eyes some opportunities

191
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,939
some options if they're unable to you

192
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,590
there's also no-till operations that is

193
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:18,719
they require herbicides but often used

194
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:20,579
in conjunction with those you know to

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,830
burn down the cover crop where pumpkins

196
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,569
can help keep the pumpkins clean but

197
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:27,120
watch for mice they like to hide in this

198
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:30,329
residual cover but again less trips in

199
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,860
the field reduces costs allows these

200
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:33,599
vining crops to vine out without much

201
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,490
competition so that's some advantages

202
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,930
begin especially late in the season the

203
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,370
mice can start burrowing holes in the

204
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,840
pumpkins and an increased rate because

205
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,800
they have all of this forage to kind of

206
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,959
hide in there's also zone tillage this

207
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,550
is tilling only thin rows and then the

208
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,339
plants will actually be started this

209
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,090
leaves most of the soil undisturbed

210
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:52,679
advantages you can break up soil

211
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:55,229
compaction because deeper than most

212
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,970
tillage reduced fuel consumption reduced

213
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,400
time in the field here are some examples

214
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:02,400
by Judy Boucher he drew up some figures

215
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,049
on time and fuel savings reduce field

216
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,289
prep time by sixty six to eighty three

217
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,939
percent and fuel savings seventy two to

218
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,560
seventy seven percent fuel savings

219
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:12,529
because you're going through one areas

220
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,759
and a plow in Herring the entire field

221
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,069
the disadvantage in this method does

222
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,199
take special equipment can require a

223
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:22,079
bigger tractor for example two rows own

224
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,750
builder here takes about 70 horsepower

225
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,550
is recommended for for Road be 120

226
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,160
horsepower it's might be out of the leak

227
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,439
for some people other people just might

228
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,330
need the equipment farms can also share

229
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,779
the equipment so that can reduce your

230
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,910
individual cost cultivation another way

231
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,339
to deal with weeds can be limiting with

232
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,168
plant height measure the tractor for

233
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,670
clearance this is where if you saw my

234
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:46,829
previous view of the farm equipment john

235
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:49,169
deere em got a lot of ground clearance i

236
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,810
can easily run over rows particularly

237
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:53,429
for potatoes without a problem but 22 to

238
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:55,679
24 inches of ground clearance

239
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:56,969
some tractors do not offer that so you

240
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,469
want to be careful and mindful of that

241
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,790
some of you have to space the Rose a

242
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,470
little bit more so you can just drive in

243
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,569
between them other times you can just

244
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,920
drive right over them so again just

245
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,980
something to consider and that's where

246
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,689
the planning comes in steel sea bed is

247
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,250
another method the goal is not to go

248
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,750
very deep when you're cultivating you

249
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,960
just want to scuff the surface as these

250
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,879
two Farmall tractor show the tractors

251
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,350
with good ground clearance alright our

252
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,289
deal so you can get in between the rows

253
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,149
these are strike setup here and the wide

254
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:25,469
front here yeah we're just kind of going

255
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,720
through and discussing the surface up to

256
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,540
knock the weeds down and our middle row

257
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,149
here is our crop basket leaders are

258
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,829
another option this is the looks very

259
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,029
similar like the Alice charm or G

260
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,639
because you were able to look down the

261
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:40,559
engine is mounted in the back spacing is

262
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,629
important on these and depends on the

263
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,669
crop I say here you want a little

264
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:46,169
cultivator blade what cultivator plight

265
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:48,149
is when the cultivator is running down

266
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:51,059
and just slips a little it's the left or

267
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:52,799
right and cultivates the actual crop

268
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,239
it's causing the blight you're actually

269
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,059
damaging the main crop so you want to

270
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,399
try to avoid that make sure your

271
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:01,979
cultivators got a good coffee in the

272
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,379
morning and is Wilma go and stay focused

273
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,860
on watching that only taking the weeds

274
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,559
out

275
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,139
there's also flame leaders those looking

276
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,219
to have a little fun outside don't tell

277
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,259
right after you flame lead because

278
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,910
they're just gonna bring up seeds that

279
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,830
are deep in the soil you just want to

280
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:18,809
fling way to just kill the top good for

281
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,460
killing recently germinated weeds can be

282
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:22,529
done just after plan to ensure the crop

283
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,230
has a head start and there's a lot of

284
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,209
burners here with the tank also good in

285
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,210
areas with impervious surface to go

286
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:34,379
through and burn them down again has its

287
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:35,460
advantages this is a good example and

288
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:37,320
there's a lot of words here you can

289
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,820
always pause the video to read this but

290
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,170
carrots is ooh now if you've grown those

291
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:45,480
in here with weeding timing is very

292
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:47,759
important as I'd mentioned before here

293
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,139
carrots grow slow breeze real quick we

294
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,720
try to clean the bed before weeding this

295
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:54,269
is an example someone gave they did two

296
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,790
rows here planted and then recently

297
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:58,799
flame weeded and fling lead very early

298
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:00,839
it could be tilled in some cases could

299
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,969
see the amount of weed pressure here is

300
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,580
greater it does get a little less deeper

301
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,080
in the row a little further away but

302
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,149
this is our ideal case here

303
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,410
the left the double roasted carrots for

304
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,389
Rose and Toto were flame we didn't

305
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:14,789
planted early the weed pressures near

306
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:16,319
greater at the near end and at the far

307
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:18,269
end on the right hand side though

308
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,580
several more rows of carrots were

309
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:21,570
planted flame we did in planted two

310
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,579
weeks later

311
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,060
so weed so all germinate at the same

312
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:28,379
time we went to flame lead an area let

313
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,958
it rest for a little bit let the weeds

314
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:33,088
regrow flame we did again plant so you

315
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,039
kind of get your crop a head start does

316
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:38,250
this last forever no but it gives your

317
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,349
crop a big head start so this is we're

318
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,669
keeping records and timing is important

319
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,329
because you definitely want your rows

320
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:47,129
tools like this and not like this

321
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:48,870
civilizations another option for you if

322
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:50,338
you have a big piece of plastic can be

323
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,889
used for Disease Control buts that are

324
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,959
sued for weed suppression often times

325
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:56,730
it's quoted as suppressing disease and

326
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,518
it can but the hard part is getting it

327
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,670
deep enough into the root zone after you

328
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,019
do this please don't tell because you've

329
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:07,019
completed for maximum weed suppression

330
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,578
if you Solarize and then till you're

331
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,828
bringing up those weed seeds that are

332
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:12,299
