00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,240
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,359
we're going to tackle looking at the

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,160
2018

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,039
farm bill and the confusion regarding

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,798
thc

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:15,039
and how it is defined within the 2018

7
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,559
farm bill so first off what does the

8
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,960
farm bill actually state

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,079
well the farm bill has a definition here

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,719
the term hemp

11
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,719
that means the plant can visit l and any

12
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,479
part of that plant including the seeds

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,719
thereof and all derivatives

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,719
extracts cannabinoids isomers acids

15
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,000
salts and salts of isomers whether

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,679
growing or not

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,039
with a delta 9 tetracannabidiol thc

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:41,200
concentration of not more than 0.3

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,640
percent on a dry weight basis

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,280
this is how the 2018 farm bill defines

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,878
hemp so this makes it seem like only

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,760
delta 9 thc

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,039
is of concern until you get to another

24
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,159
section

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,600
particularly section 297b 2a

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,198
i is red which causes the confusion

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,079
there's this main source of confusion

28
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:03,599
here

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,000
so what does that kind of refer to what

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,599
is that looking at well it specifically

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,840
states that a

32
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,679
procedure for testing using post

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,960
decarboxylation or other similar

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,840
reliable methods

35
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,519
delta nine tetracan ivanol thc again

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,320
concentration levels of hemp

37
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,679
produced in the state or territory of

38
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,000
the indian tribe

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,960
so what are the typical accepted testing

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,519
methods well there's

41
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,879
two there's the post decarboxylation and

42
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,959
then there's high performance liquid

43
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,199
chromatography

44
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,478
hplc so as decarboxylation turned

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,920
marijuana

46
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,519
into marijuana and this is looking at

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,759
that thca

48
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,280
heating it and then creating that kind

49
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,840
of delta nine

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,879
thc here so that he is removing that

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
carboxyl group

52
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,560
that's essentially that a form of the

53
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,519
thc to get the

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,118
delta nine thc so this is important to

55
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,679
kind of make this distinction of this

56
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,159
kind of

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,880
variant that does occur so we can take a

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
look at this

59
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,399
definition here of post decarboxylation

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,640
this is a process

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,680
which the acid cannabidized

62
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,878
cannabinoids sorry which such as thca

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,040
are heated to an active form

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,479
this then converts them to a neutral

65
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,280
cannabid

66
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,199
cannabinoids like thc so this is that

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,318
conversion of that thc a

68
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,159
to that delta nine thc to

69
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,639
decarboxylate hemp it needs to be heated

70
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,439
to around 220 degrees fahrenheit

71
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,479
for around 30 to 45 minutes of exposure

72
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,439
although that time

73
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,479
does vary as you can kind of see here a

74
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,878
little bit

75
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,159
so this is that decarboxylation step

76
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,479
this is that

77
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,519
cannabinoids converting that thca to

78
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,518
that delta 9

79
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
thc so we're looking at that high

80
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,560
performance liquid chromatograph hplc

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,319
formerly referred to as high pressure

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,719
i'll look at chromatography again

83
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,639
looking is a technique in analytical

84
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,598
chemistry used to separate identify

85
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,279
and quantify each component in a mixture

86
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,079
it's very good at being very precise

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,919
about that

88
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,519
it relies on pumps to pass pasteurized

89
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,318
liquid and solvent-containing sample

90
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,319
mixture

91
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,919
through a column filled with a solid

92
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,318
absorbent material

93
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,000
each component in sample interacts

94
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:12,799
slightly differently with the absorbent

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,239
material

96
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,840
causing different flow rates of the

97
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,599
different components and leading to the

98
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,439
separation of those compounds

99
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,719
as they flow through the column what

100
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,560
that ends up creating is

101
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,400
like little peaks and you can think of

102
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,120
these peaks being like kind of a

103
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,280
fingerprint

104
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,158
signature of what that compound contains

105
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,000
broken down into very specific kind of

106
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,639
areas there i mean where there's a peak

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,039
you can trace that down and have an idea

108
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,798
what

109
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,479
that compound actually is and what's

110
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,200
present there if you run two different

111
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,560
liquids

112
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,560
they'll give you two different peaks two

113
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
different signatures there

114
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,759
so why does the testing method affect

115
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
how the law is interpreted

116
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,239
well both testing methods allow for the

117
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,599
amount of delta 9 thc to be detected

118
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,680
however hplc unlike the decarboxylation

119
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:01,280
step does not need to convert

120
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,959
the thc a to the delta 9 thc

121
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,199
and instead of isolates of the delta 9

122
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,719
thc so you're getting this slightly

123
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,318
different results here

124
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,719
which is what's leading to part of the

125
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,359
confusion so when we interpret the

126
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,359
actual

127
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,639
farm bill as the law recommends post

128
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,519
decarboxylation

129
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,959
but also states that hemp is defined as

130
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,918
under 0.3

131
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
delta 9 thc so there's that kind of

132
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,039
controversy there and

133
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,280
because this has led to the individual

134
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,560
states to determine what the law means

135
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:35,519
and is somewhat contradictory so

136
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,319
it's being defined as under that delta 9

137
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,519
thc

138
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,439
but is that the total thc is there some

139
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,560
interpretation going on in the state

140
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,800
basis

141
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
depending on what step or what kind of

142
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,840
process they're using as far as

143
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,160
what thc are they exactly calculating so

144
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,119
there

145
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,199
could sadly continue to be confusion so

146
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,759
the usda has not developed a standard

147
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,800
test for determining the delta 9 thc and

148
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,759
as we saw here

149
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,439
the decarboxylation and hplc do yield

150
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,800
slightly different results there

151
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,160
so until the test that has been

152
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
developed there will continue to be

153
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,720
confusion between states and the federal

154
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
law

155
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,560
unless further clarification from the

156
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,000
federal government is given

157
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,160
so i know this can be a little bit

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
confusing but hopefully this provide

159
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,120
with some

160
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,199
detail or some of the science behind the

161
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,840
reason for the confusion

162
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,319
and the potential different

163
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:30,638
interpretation

164
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,639
of the 2018 farm bill defining hemp
