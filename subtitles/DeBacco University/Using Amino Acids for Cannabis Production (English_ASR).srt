1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
so many growers talk about adding amino

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,240
acids to their cannabis plants

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,599
is it a worthwhile process here at

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:17,278
tobacco university

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:19,198
we'll answer that very question

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,640
so let's get into using amino acids for

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,400
cannabis production

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,080
so first off what are our amino acids

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,000
which basically start with the basis

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,239
and there any group of organic molecules

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,879
that consist of a basic amino group

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,598
an acidic carboxyl group and in an

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,000
organic r

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,000
group or side chain its variable this is

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,920
unique to each amino acid

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
we can see them listed the 21 listed

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,280
right here the remaining two bonds of

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,960
the alpha carbon

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,920
atom are generally testified by hydrogen

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,600
atoms and r group so keep in mind that

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,198
kind of this amino group here

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,039
what defines the different amino acids

23
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,439
is kind of this side chain here

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,198
we can see some are electrically charged

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,358
side chains some the positive

26
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,479
charge some of the negative charge some

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,198
have uncharged

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,959
side chains some are special cases some

29
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,158
have um hydrophilic

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,759
phobic sorry um side chains so all these

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,439
must be taken into consideration

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,520
it just causes amino acids to make up

33
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,000
proteins that gives proteins their

34
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,560
unique

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,840
shape so here's a reference article

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,920
looking at some

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,200
applications of amino acids improved

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,159
yield and lettuce

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,040
by enhancing photosynthesis and nutrient

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,000
availability

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,240
so we're going to relate this to

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,319
cannabis so amino acids study

43
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,920
conclusions here looking at the lettuce

44
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,078
they can be inferred that the l and

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
that's just to form methionine

46
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,919
increase the chlorophyll concentration

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,719
of plants and contributes to the saving

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
of energy

49
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,280
thus boosting plant yield in lettuce

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,280
this also led to

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,200
significant increases in observed

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
physiological factors in lettuce leaves

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,920
and lower concentrations because of

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,478
at high concentrations it affects oxygen

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,239
uptake

56
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,560
which can kill plants this is again

57
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,920
where dosing is a very important

58
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
parameter to consider

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,840
more is not better in brief looking at

60
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,040
the lettuce the l

61
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,960
methionine at concentrations of 0.2

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,000
milligrams per liter showed the best

63
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,598
effect on the growth of lettuce plants

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
so how does this kind of relate to

65
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,679
cannabis or if we're looking back

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
through how can

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,680
relates to cannabis well applying a

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,878
general amino acid product may have

69
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,200
limiting benefits

70
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,039
as a result indicate that specific amino

71
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,719
acids needs to be studied

72
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,159
that there only may be a limited number

73
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,560
that could show plant benefits

74
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,159
just adding amino acids isn't really

75
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,920
going to help plants per side

76
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,598
might be some specific ones that may

77
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,359
have direct application

78
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,959
also the application rates are another

79
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,640
important consideration since higher

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
rates have been shown to have impacts on

81
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,479
plant hormone pathways

82
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,360
that could result in plant death or at

83
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,280
least negative

84
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
impacts on the plant so if you're going

85
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,439
to use them amino acids

86
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,799
do so carefully and in moderation and

87
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,840
observe the plant

88
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
to see if you're actually getting a

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,759
benefit or a change always good to run a

90
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,439
control which is one that would not have

91
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,359
amino acids to see if there are any

92
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,239
visual differences or morphological

93
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,120
differences

94
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,759
to determine whether it's not it's worth

95
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,719
the

96
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,518
extra expense of adding amino acids to

97
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,719
your cannabis

98
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,719
plant production
