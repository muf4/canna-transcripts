1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
welcome to dubaco university here we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,599
going to be looking at

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,359
some hair basics and getting some of the

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,320
details for what we can actually

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,400
determine

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,638
when looking at a piece of hair and what

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,120
components hair is made of

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,838
so first off a hair and fiber analysis

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,919
so

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,760
in this case cannot be used to match a

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,439
suspect with a crime scene

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,199
can be microscopically analyzed for

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,719
similarities and comparisons can be

14
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,760
provided to improve

15
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,759
as forensic techniques improve keep in

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,560
mind hair and fiber both fall into the

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,520
category

18
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,199
of being class evidence now here in

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,000
fibers for identification

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,920
we'll hear offers some benefits to

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,520
forensic scientists because the hair

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,440
resists decomposition so it's more

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
likely to be found at a crime scene

24
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,119
here may also indicate drug use or

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,280
poisoning and we can see with that and

26
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,718
analyzing the hair different regions of

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,079
that hair we could find

28
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,120
a potential for drug usage in a certain

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,119
period of time

30
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,119
and potentially link that or at least

31
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:03,280
conclude that as part of the story

32
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:05,840
for the crime scene investigation report

33
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,599
the anatomy of hair so you're welcome to

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,000
pause the video at this point look at

35
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,478
things

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,719
in detail we're going to be focused on

37
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,200
medulla the cortex

38
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,560
in the outer portion the cuticle region

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
however realize that hair

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,320
is embedded in the skin it's all the way

41
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,759
down to the dermal layer where the blood

42
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,559
vessels are found

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
but we're going to be looking

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
specifically at that hair

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,880
fiber and some of the areas within that

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,719
hair fiber

47
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,078
so first off we got to look at the

48
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,200
general structure of

49
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,478
the hair so on the outermost portion we

50
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,960
have the cuticle

51
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,078
and this has overlapping scales and we

52
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,640
can notice that here

53
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,478
in the green region then we have the

54
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,159
cortex which is a protein-rich structure

55
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,118
around the medulla that contains the

56
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,600
pigment

57
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,799
and in that center region there we have

58
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,679
the medulla which is

59
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,240
the central core in some instances that

60
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
may be

61
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,280
absent so it's important for

62
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,960
identification purposes

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,399
the reason we have the pencil here is we

64
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,279
can think of this hair structure as a

65
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,879
pencil

66
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,200
where the medulla being the graphite or

67
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,118
that center region the cortex

68
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
being the wood represented by the pencil

69
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,560
the cuticle being the paint

70
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,759
on the outside just to get you to

71
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,280
understand

72
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,598
how these layers interact and where

73
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,159
they're located

74
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,119
now that hair structure again what we're

75
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,959
focusing on

76
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,719
is kind of these different layers and we

77
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
could see that while the hair looks very

78
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,919
thick

79
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,360
in this instance it's actually made of

80
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,199
many many small

81
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,400
fibers which is part of the reason why

82
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,719
it's so strong

83
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
for its small diameter again just to be

84
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,000
aware of where it's located within the

85
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,319
body within the

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,159
within the integumentary system i could

87
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,359
see here where it's located with some

88
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,919
glands

89
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,760
where the hair matrix is located and the

90
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,518
hair bulb down here at the bottom

91
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,000
we're looking mainly here at the hair

92
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,159
shaft and portions of the root

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,318
so this hair follicle look at the

94
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,799
follicles part of the skin which

95
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,439
grows a hair by packing old cells

96
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,120
together

97
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,639
it's attached on the inside and top of

98
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,759
the follicle are sebaceous

99
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,878
glands which are tiny sebum producing

100
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,199
glands in almost

101
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,318
all skin except the palms lips and soles

102
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,560
of the feet

103
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,839
so here we're looking at the sebum being

104
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,878
produced and that's kind of what gives

105
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,920
the hair

106
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,799
some of its protective oils as well the

107
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,598
root of the hair

108
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,400
on the hair shaft is part of the hair

109
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,318
not

110
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,039
anchored to the follicle and much of

111
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,479
this is exposed at the skin's surface

112
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,158
and the rest of the hair which is

113
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,079
anchored in the follicle

114
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,439
lies below the surface of the skin is

115
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,920
referred to as the hair

116
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,959
root so when we're investigating a

117
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,158
potential hair that may have been

118
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,000
forcefully removed

119
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,000
we might want to identify or properly

120
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,959
identify an area of the hair shaft

121
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
compared to the

122
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,799
hair root region and there's that

123
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
sebaceous gland tied right in

124
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,080
providing the oils again for that hair

125
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,359
looking at a cross section of the hair

126
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
so again think of that same pencil

127
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
concept

128
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,360
this is showing the different layers of

129
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,080
the hair shaft that medulla being in the

130
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
center

131
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,599
then we have the cortex here that may

132
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,479
contain pigment granules and in the

133
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:04,318
outermost region being the cuticle

134
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,079
that cuticle being the outermost region

135
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,839
remember that is the covering

136
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,599
of the hair we can see that here it's

137
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,759
formed by flat overlapping

138
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,359
and hardened scales and the degree of

139
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,359
those scales again help us

140
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,120
identify whether it's human hair or

141
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
potentially some animal hairs

142
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,120
as we'll see in another video but that

143
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,279
here cuticle is that outermost covering

144
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,478
here is an example of it if you remember

145
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,000
back from that first one i showed it was

146
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,599
the green outer area

147
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,839
and it's important before distinguishing

148
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,120
between hairs of different species

149
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,359
but are often not useful in

150
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,040
distinguishing between different people

151
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,879
so it might be important that we found

152
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,919
some hair well is it

153
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,319
the neighborhood cat or is it someone

154
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,719
that

155
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,319
might be a human so again the cuticle

156
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,320
can be used for identification

157
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,319
purposes when comparing the scales you

158
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,800
want to look at how many there are per

159
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,918
per centimeter how many how they overlap

160
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,360
what's their shape

161
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,959
how much they protrude from the surface

162
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,000
what's their thickness and is there

163
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,599
pigment present

164
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,600
or all questions you want to ask when

165
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,479
analyzing the cuticle

166
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,000
the cuticle classification so well they

167
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,758
all kind of look the same well

168
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
actually if you look very carefully

169
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,199
stick with a microscope

170
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,639
there are different categories that they

171
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,720
will fall into

172
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,160
and this again can help us identify what

173
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,360
potential species

174
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,560
that hair might be from and can be used

175
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,038
to eliminate

176
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,918
or again looking at class evidence here

177
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,519
eliminate

178
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,478
certain hairs that might be found that

179
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,639
aren't of human species

180
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,399
the cortex so now we're kind of looking

181
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,720
at that next layer down it's the

182
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,159
thickest hair layer located in the

183
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,240
interior portion of the hair

184
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,840
between the cuticle and the medulla it

185
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,000
contains the hair pigments or

186
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,918
melanin and pigments are absent though

187
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,680
in gray hair so as someone

188
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,519
ages and gets gray hair they're simply

189
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,959
losing their pigments

190
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,359
in the cortex region that cortex

191
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,719
specifically the distribution of cortex

192
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,439
is considered the most important

193
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,440
component

194
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,879
when attempting to distinguish between

195
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,719
different people

196
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,240
again this is still class evidence not

197
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,880
getting to individual evidence

198
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,120
but still important for different people

199
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,639
microscopic examination can also reveal

200
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,280
conditions in shape of the

201
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,918
root and the tip and the cortex varies

202
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,279
in its

203
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,959
thickness its texture and also its color

204
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,719
which is kind of important for that

205
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,239
identification purposes

206
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,080
here we see human hair and we have

207
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,519
on the head there could be on the body

208
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,159
it could be different areas we could be

209
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,478
looking at

210
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,039
and we do see a difference in the cortex

211
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,839
the two images provided here

212
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,279
the cortex the pigment granule

213
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,638
distribution so this is both looking at

214
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,399
a tabby cap

215
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,720
and again looking towards the end most

216
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,318
is closer towards the root area

217
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,400
and we can definitely see that there are

218
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
differences in the cortex

219
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,918
between these two keep in mind there's

220
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,519
also slight difference in magnification

221
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,639
so you're also seeing

222
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:55,120
more detail in the cuticle region of the

223
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,120
hair in this image down here

224
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
getting to the medulla that center

225
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,199
portion

226
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
interior most area of the hair this is

227
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,960
the most noticeable

228
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,639
hair feature in many species the medulla

229
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,478
is that center region

230
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,840
so like the cuticle the medulla is

231
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,279
characterized by

232
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,359
importance in distinguishing between

233
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,439
hairs of different species

234
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,199
but they are often not useful in

235
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,120
distinction between different people

236
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,080
again the medulla may vary in its

237
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,759
thickness connectivity the opacity

238
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,199
that refers to kind of the structure is

239
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,240
it broken into pieces is it all

240
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,720
continuous

241
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,000
how much light is able to pass through

242
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,199
and keep in mind it could also be

243
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,759
absent in certain species as well so

244
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,680
again very important we're looking at

245
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,960
class evidence is the medulla region of

246
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,038
the hair

247
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,239
medulla patterns so there's three main

248
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:43,279
characteristics we could have a

249
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,598
continuous

250
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,279
and interrupted or intermittent more

251
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,199
specific you could have fragmented

252
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,519
or it could also just be absent and

253
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,160
that's basically relating to no pattern

254
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,680
but would be important to note the

255
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,960
classification of the medulla so we

256
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
could see here again

257
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,159
we just like have different

258
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,039
classifications for structure and

259
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,120
pattern

260
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,478
forming at the margins and again this

261
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,038
can help us

262
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,199
use this information as class

263
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,360
characteristics of the hair samples

264
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,478
found and collected at a potential crime

265
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
scene

266
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,318
there's also something called a medulla

267
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,039
index and this describes the thickness

268
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,639
of the

269
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,079
layer that's calculated by measuring the

270
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,759
diameter of the doula and dividing by

271
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,680
the diameter of the hair

272
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,080
so here the medulla index for human hair

273
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
is generally less than one-third and the

274
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,758
medulla index for animal hair is usually

275
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,879
greater than one-half

276
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,479
so this can help be another form of

277
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,399
quantitative analysis

278
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,479
when we're trying to classify different

279
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,559
hair using the medulla index

280
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,080
is one method so as you can see there's

281
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,399
a lot of different types

282
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,839
of ways to kind of look at here analyze

283
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,679
here and understand here

284
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,600
and hopefully this provided you with a

285
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,319
little insight to all the options that

286
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,320
are available
