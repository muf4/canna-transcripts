1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,730
okay here we're a look and review ions

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,980
and exactly what this is so when I spend

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,789
a little time on this slide right here

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:14,969
we see a neutral hydrogen atom this is

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:17,788
not an ion it's got one proton one

6
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:20,519
electron one positive charge one

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,890
negative charge therefore one proton one

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,018
electron it's net charge would be zero

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,990
be neutral and this notation just be

10
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,618
hydrogen now if that hydrogen loses an

11
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:34,589
electron it is going to become positive

12
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:36,450
there's one positive proton no negative

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,600
charges therefore it takes on a positive

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,969
one charge being noted as H+ that was

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,399
what we would call a cation that's a

16
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,980
positive ion contrast to that we have

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,679
our neutral hydrogen atom here and we

18
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:53,729
add an electron so now we have two

19
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,429
electrons in one proton now we have one

20
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:58,468
positive charge in two negative charges

21
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:02,399
the net charge on this would be a

22
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,099
negative one and eh- is how to be noted

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,200
that we called in an ion it's a negative

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,750
ion there so let's look at this a little

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,299
bit more more here's the same slide I

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,728
showed you here so in an atom an ion is

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,820
an atom or group of atoms that has a net

28
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:20,579
positive or negative charge so again

29
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:23,008
that ion referring to something that has

30
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,920
a charge neutral would just be called an

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,709
atom atoms can gain or lose electrons to

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,030
form ions an ion is an atom of the

33
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,669
charge that's your kind of take home

34
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,829
summary right there recall that atoms

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,070
are neutral in charge if electron is

36
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:39,919
lost the overall charge is positive and

37
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,508
electron is gained in atom becomes

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,329
negative so initially this does confuse

39
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,090
students losing an electron becomes

40
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,158
positive when electron keep in mind is a

41
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,829
negative charge for losing a negative

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,290
charge the overall charge their port is

43
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:58,139
positive or so not easier think of the

44
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,210
other way if an electron is gained the

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,189
atom is gaining a negative charge its

46
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,169
itself going to become negative we see

47
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:07,889
that in their example here is the same

48
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:11,310
thing in the title slide now an ins at

49
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,189
ions and atomic radius so we're looking

50
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,199
at atomic radius here

51
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:18,139
when electrons are lost their radius

52
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:22,280
becomes smaller when electrons are

53
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:25,729
gained the radius becomes larger so we

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:29,270
see that here we see our ions is the

55
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:30,139
dark grey here and here we're losing an

56
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,240
electron

57
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:35,599
therefore if we're losing the electron

58
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,100
the radius will become smaller potassium

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,930
which is represented by k+ here it's

60
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:45,769
neutral atom would be this large blue

61
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:49,490
area when it loses the electron the

62
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:51,159
electron the erase becomes smaller you

63
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,830
see that here it's smaller radius

64
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:57,379
contrast to that here our nonmetals

65
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,660
let's take chlorine for example neutral

66
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,150
atom here is that kind of Tanis region

67
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:04,819
when it gains the Rays becomes larger so

68
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,010
it's gaining an electron that ion

69
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:09,919
that negative ion it an ion here is

70
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:13,099
larger than the neutral atom so it's how

71
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:17,569
our atomic radius changes based on the

72
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:19,879
ion that these elements may form showing

73
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:21,969
how that may look here positive cation

74
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,439
formation when an atom loses electrons

75
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:27,229
radius always becomes smaller because

76
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,989
the loss of a valence electron can leave

77
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:32,840
an empty outer orbital resulting in a

78
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,969
smaller radius electrostatic repulsion

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,280
decreases allowing the electrons to be

80
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:38,449
pulled closer to the radius so how does

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,759
that look here we see here our outer

82
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:43,339
shell valence electron has one we've

83
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,169
removed that electron creating the +1

84
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,709
charge and we see this visually right

85
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:53,208
here there's a change in a reduction in

86
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:55,310
the radius of that particular atom we

87
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:59,780
see that here for giving a group 1 group

88
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:02,629
2 group 13 how the ion in red is smaller

89
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,449
than the neutral atom represented in

90
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:08,590
gray and we see how those trends occur

91
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:11,268
here in the periodic table

92
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,909
continuing on via and negative ion

93
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,220
Organa information when atoms gain

94
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:18,620
electrons the radius always increases

95
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,019
which is sometimes contrary and like why

96
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,538
does this occur more electrons mean more

97
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:26,360
electrostatic repulsion resulting in an

98
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:27,050
increase in the diameter here we have

99
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,180
more

100
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,908
negative charges out here is a negative

101
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,918
one more electrons out there think of

102
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:37,219
just more space that they need so

103
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:39,709
therefore the radius and an anion the

104
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,949
negative charge will increase over the

105
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:44,538
neutral atom we see that trend that

106
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,970
developed here also on the periodic

107
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:48,860
table here's the neutral atom and then

108
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:53,120
here's our ions that are forming in blue

109
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:56,419
we see overall all those are larger the

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,990
in ions are larger radius than their

111
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:58,990
neutral atom
