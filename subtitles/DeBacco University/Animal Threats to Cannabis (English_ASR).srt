1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,299
so when we think of threats to canvas

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,940
plants we may think of merely the

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:07,740
microscopic and very small threats we

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,949
can't forget about the larger animal

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,359
threats to cannabis production so in law

6
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,699
threats may be of greater concern for

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,969
outdoor operations well but mice can be

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,009
a problem indoor grows as well as the

9
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:22,589
outdoor grows now while a bunch of

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,779
animals here pictured odds are starfish

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,429
enjoy fish probably not high on the

12
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,550
threats to cannabis but others

13
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,050
definitely are for example threats from

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,500
above we want to watch out for birds

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,320
they can attack particularly newly

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,238
planted seedlings outdoors in particular

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,520
crows can be very destructive in that

18
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,799
regards turkeys can also be a problem if

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,420
you have a recently tilled field with

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,308
all this exposed soil they like to go to

21
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,140
recently prepared field and dust

22
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:50,699
themselves or they can walk across

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,308
plastic you're using that for weed

24
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,030
control do damage there so be mindful

25
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:58,589
and keep an eye out for turkeys larger

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,480
animals such as deer and bears well

27
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,219
bears are an issue sorry is that much

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,679
you can really do because there are

29
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,840
large powerful organisms that can easy

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,580
tear down fences and do whole host of

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,219
damage onto your plants but also

32
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,228
yourself deer though make things called

33
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,789
deer fence and they can potentially do

34
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:17,670
some feeding damage but also a physical

35
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,380
plant damage deer fence is the best

36
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,829
method of control but be careful to

37
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,879
ensure that the bottom is well secured

38
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:25,978
typically think of deer jumping over

39
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,688
fence but they also like to try and

40
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:29,969
crawl under the fence so make sure at

41
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:32,609
the bottom is secured very well as well

42
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,759
as the top the fence should be about

43
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:38,069
eight to 12 feet tall you can cheat as I

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,978
said by having the fence shorter but

45
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:43,438
using poles that are the full kind of 12

46
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:45,179
10 feet so tall there because deer will

47
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,618
run up to the fence and they'll look up

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,770
and he'll look for the tops of the poles

49
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:51,840
and that can be one way you can try to

50
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,908
cheat use a shorter fence because feds

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,500
can be expensive and try to get the same

52
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,439
effect of preventing deer from entering

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,909
your gross base fish from below the

54
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,978
Gophers and woodchucks living pucks a

55
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,740
tawny shell here on Groundhog Day

56
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,299
these are animals that burrow they be a

57
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,818
challenge because they dig holes and

58
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,009
tunnels I can go under fences and they

59
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,289
can also be very destructive in a very

60
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,859
short period of time I can sometimes

61
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,750
bury

62
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,000
to try to eliminate them from going over

63
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,189
should say under and burning the tunnels

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,610
but they can be again very destructive

65
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:26,039
in those regards threats that are small

66
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,290
so mice involves are examples of very

67
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:32,549
small animals that can cause a large

68
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:34,560
damage to it operation for mice watch

69
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,330
for plants as much as the seeds you're

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,280
storing and also going to be planting

71
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,780
sometimes you go through and plant a

72
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,569
bunch of seeds and mice can come through

73
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,979
and burrow and dig up and just kind of

74
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:48,090
play in the soil and cause all sorts of

75
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:50,340
germination is challenges their cat can

76
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,069
be very effective method for control to

77
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,509
kind of keep mice away kind of having a

78
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,400
set up in let me have her traps is

79
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:58,649
another way but just be mindful

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,150
especially starting in the spring or in

81
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,189
the fall when you have a heat source

82
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,800
they easily can find that and be very

83
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:06,870
destructive also keep your seeds stored

84
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,080
in sealed containers that might so go in

85
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,980
nests those other either threats from

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,840
grazers squirrels and chipmunks

87
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,459
squirrels can be curious and cause

88
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,400
random and frustrating damage at times

89
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,509
they also be very difficult to control

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
electric fence can help with squirrels

91
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,709
small havahart traps with chipmunks with

92
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,798
peanut butter SB is a way to help

93
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,719
control them they're very fast moving

94
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,019
and again can burrow and dig and top

95
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,509
plants which is again not welcomed in in

96
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,920
a growth area

97
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:36,810
lastly rabbits rabbits may be numerous

98
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,339
around plants but often do little or no

99
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,409
damage out so you have a threat with a

100
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,689
question mark here these odds are while

101
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:45,090
they may be around then odds of them

102
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,019
doing really severe damage are quite low

103
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,939
so again don't think you have to

104
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,260
eliminate everything in this case this

105
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,319
could be an animal you can potentially

106
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:55,639
tolerate due to the threat of it causing

107
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,639
damage is very low
