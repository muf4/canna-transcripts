1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,439
okay looking at hydroponic systems there

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:07,560
are some that require an airstone air

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,630
pumps there also some that are called

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,089
passive and these basically use a

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,548
wicking system to be able to transfer

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:16,618
the nutrient solution and as a result

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,390
reduce the amount of electrical

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,059
dependency it can increase the

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,439
reliability so first off passive or

10
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:24,149
sometimes called simple hydroponic

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,399
systems utilize what we call capillary

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,979
action through a wicking system you can

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,899
see the two different diameters of tubes

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,359
here you can see the smaller the

15
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,799
diameter the greater the water can kind

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,339
of wick or through capillary actually

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,929
move up against the surface tension here

18
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,260
these wicking systems last moving parts

19
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:45,988
it literally is just a wicking water

20
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,238
that's moving against gravity with no

21
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:50,009
need for moving parts this can reduce

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,308
the maintenance and also lower the

23
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,869
initial cost to the grower these passive

24
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:56,459
systems are the nutrient solutions are

25
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,709
passively whipped or transported to the

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,899
root system you can see here we have an

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,969
inverted bottle and it's being whipped

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,859
right to the root system also if you've

29
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,290
done chromatography you can see that

30
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,420
same thing here where that solvent front

31
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,790
is moving against gravity it's wicking

32
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,409
up the chromatography paper substrate

33
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,240
selection can be very important for

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,820
making like sawdust peat moss and Coco

35
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:22,438
car can be utilize there's also some

36
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:25,048
rock wall or rock wall like material

37
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,359
that can also serve as a wick of water

38
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,340
and nutrient solution this system has no

39
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,609
moving parts it's based on that just

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,210
natural flow of water based on capillary

41
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:38,009
action this capillary action is based on

42
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,559
the movement of materials and we can see

43
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,438
here where we've got the slow movement

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,960
of water up this substrate and again if

45
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,658
we remember back from soil types and the

46
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:52,169
clay particles versus sand sand being

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,200
much larger particles example here clay

48
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,100
being much finer or smaller particles

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,950
representing here and we could see as

50
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,500
those particle sizes decrease as that

51
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,740
diameter of the tube gets smaller the

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,810
height that water can be whipped is

53
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:10,489
increased as a result this is a very

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,598
low-cost setup and very easy to maintain

55
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:13,710
keep in mind though the kinds of

56
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,509
capillary action all

57
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,520
there are benefits the media becomes

58
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:19,649
saturated with water and as a result

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,420
very little oxygen can get in for a

60
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,490
scuba diver here kind of representing

61
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:26,609
that roots need to breathe and to

62
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,170
respire need to take in oxygen as a

63
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,880
result this can reduce the efficiency of

64
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:30,899
the system so when we're looking at

65
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,669
capillary action think of like

66
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,980
saturating a sponge the more water that

67
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:37,049
comes in sadly the less air there will

68
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,389
be there's a theoretical maximum there

69
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,610
but if we over saturate the solution and

70
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:43,229
over hold the water yields will decrease

71
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,300
simply because of the lack of oxygen

72
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:49,609
being able to supply to the roots

73
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,610
cutting down their rate of respiration
