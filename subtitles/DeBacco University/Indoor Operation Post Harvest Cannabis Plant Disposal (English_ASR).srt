1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,439
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,398
going to go over

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,759
the post-harvest canvas plant disposal

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,800
that goes a little bit more than just

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,320
beyond the plants

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,320
i want to consider about some of the

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,559
supporting equipment that it takes

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,160
to grow a plant indoors and how are we

9
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,239
best going to dispose of that

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,079
to think about this whole production

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,079
process in a sustainable manner

12
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:30,479
[Music]

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,719
all right let's go over indoor

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,079
operations post-harvest cannabis plant

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,000
disposal

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,280
so first off disposal of the actual

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,759
plant material

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,719
we can see here per the epa caymus waste

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,399
must also be made unusable and

20
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,239
unrecognizable before disposal mixed

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,320
with at least 50 percent non-cannabis

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,198
waste such as non-consumable solids

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,039
and stored in a secured waste receptacle

24
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,878
chemist waste can be disposed of

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,559
in a permanent landfill or through

26
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,280
composting consideration

27
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,919
or by means of in-vessel digestion there

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,759
are

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,520
landfill options which most cannabis

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,679
growers and processors are

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,760
shipping cannabis waste to landfills so

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520
it's under federal scrutiny

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,280
composting is a goal to provide optimal

34
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,079
conditions for microbial metabolism to

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,359
help kind of

36
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,280
break down that process incineration is

37
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,840
this must occur at temperatures that are

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,799
high enough to destroy the toxic organic

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,478
components in and in the hazardous waste

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,799
as well as reduce the overall

41
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,319
volume note that this is not the same as

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,920
burning the leaves in your backyard

43
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,000
incineration is a much more

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,680
directed and controlled process then

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
there's in-vessel digestion which is a

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,040
more efficient method of composting

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,599
wherein the waste is confined within a

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
building

49
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,199
container or vesicle in order to

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,399
mechanically control airflow

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,000
temperature moisture and odors now

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,519
with indoor growing we also want to be

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
mindful and consider it of the

54
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,239
containers

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,159
some growers will reuse containers but

56
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,239
this can potentially carry over diseases

57
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,640
from one crop to another so

58
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,399
keep this in mind growers do need to

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,280
find a method of disposal of their

60
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,519
containers

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
depending on the size used in location

62
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,399
they may

63
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,679
be wanted by homeowners or donated to

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,759
community garden settings

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
depending on the size that you're using

66
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,840
and in the sense

67
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,080
that you could buy fresh every time

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,759
look at disposal of the substrate so the

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,959
substrate that is used will impact the

70
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,120
disposal method

71
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,400
solas mix is the easiest to dispose of

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,400
as it has more

73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
universal applications so it can be used

74
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,159
in more secondary situations

75
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,319
and can even be added to compost

76
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,280
operations rockwell's more difficult to

77
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,238
dispose of

78
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
and simply typically sadly ends up in a

79
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,480
dumpster

80
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,400
now this soilless mix we're going to

81
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,039
take a quick step outside

82
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
so we can see kind of a kind of harvest

83
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,799
that went through

84
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,560
source mix that's left with our that was

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,280
grown in our containers for our cannabis

86
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,360
plants

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
and kind of how that looks on a

88
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
relatively small growing operation

89
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
so let's take a jump outside and we'll

90
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,159
come back inside and discuss some other

91
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,439
methods

92
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,120
now when setting up an indoor grow

93
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,959
operation you want to take into account

94
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,000
the entire growing season

95
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,920
and what you're going to be doing with

96
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,360
the plants overall so let's just show

97
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,719
some examples here

98
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
of some containers that have been

99
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,719
harvested we see

100
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,840
kind of what's left over let's hope will

101
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,680
be composted

102
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,039
out of some other amendments and kind of

103
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,439
reworked potential

104
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,199
for a crop coming in the future all

105
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,000
right welcome back inside hopefully that

106
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,000
just shows you

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
kind of that looking at that disposal

108
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,560
method when we want to consider the

109
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
substrate

110
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,598
we also want to be mindful of in our

111
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,639
indoor operations the

112
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,238
lights that are required so know the

113
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,119
materials that are in the bulbs because

114
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,560
many times they contain mercury in other

115
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,319
hazardous materials

116
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,479
we can see a whole collection of bulbs

117
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,158
here some single-ended dumbbell ended

118
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,598
this means that they cannot simply be

119
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,679
disposed of in the trash

120
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,119
be sure to drop them off at proper house

121
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
waste facilities don't just throw them

122
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
in the trash

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
and again on larger operations with a

124
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,158
lot of lights we also want to be

125
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,760
conservative the

126
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,438
ballasts themselves be sure you're

127
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,598
disposing of this properly

128
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,120
a lot of times they fit great and uh

129
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,598
containers can be picked up and

130
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,560
as a whole collection or sometimes

131
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,959
hazardous waste

132
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,959
locations have certain drop off times

133
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,519
that you could bring the lights or

134
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,360
used bulbs and lights to then we have

135
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,920
disposal lastly of the plant support

136
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,239
materials

137
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,238
and regardless of the method used plants

138
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,478
will often need some form of support

139
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,160
some use trellis netting or stakes these

140
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,918
can be reused in some cases

141
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,840
but this is more common with stakes as

142
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,758
they will go through a soak of some kind

143
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,719
of sterilization step before they are

144
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
reused

145
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,680
so just keep that in mind you don't want

146
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
to be using the same stakes in the sense

147
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,000
you could

148
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
carry over insects it could carry over

149
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,519
disease

150
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,478
all threats to your future growing areas

151
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,120
so you won't have a sterile

152
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,758
sterilization step unless you're buying

153
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,600
new

154
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,600
each and every time
