1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,839
okay I'm gonna go over field

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:05,759
preparations kind of like this is saying

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,679
here without a plan you can never be

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,509
lost so I know there's a lot of

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,638
variability depending on the size of

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,869
your field or equipment that you might

7
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,278
have so I'm going to be kind of in

8
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:18,929
general terms here so once you start

9
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:20,339
deciding to get your field together well

10
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,660
I always say you're already behind

11
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,879
there's something you can be doing each

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,800
season if you haven't started yet

13
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,618
following typically we're moving on the

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,109
crops the planting cover crops taking

15
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,939
soil tests the winter you can actually

16
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,030
lime in the winter frost heating can

17
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:38,070
help incorporate and compile records

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,679
inside where it's nice and warm and

19
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,079
develop a plan for next season in the

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,399
spring it's a crazy time I want to kill

21
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,289
the cover crop you want to plant the

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,299
main crop you want weed control your

23
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,789
irrigation set up a lots going on in the

24
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,409
spring some are also very busy

25
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,899
monitoring for disease be trying to be

26
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:57,029
proactive checking in systems harvesting

27
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,090
crops ideally there's always something

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,219
going on in the fields even that we have

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,250
those four distinctive seasons even if

30
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,320
you're not necessarily thing for winter

31
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,170
markets there's always something to do

32
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,099
on the farm so the field you should know

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,079
when to stay away and this is

34
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,000
particularly important in the springtime

35
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,048
if it's wet stay away you don't want to

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,090
get the tractor stuck you know on

37
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,670
destroy the soil a lot of bad things can

38
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,530
happen here you're damaging the soil in

39
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,890
ways that you may not be able to get the

40
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,269
texture back to the way it was before so

41
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,129
when in doubt stay away trying to find a

42
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,408
drier field try to do something else and

43
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:33,060
no he gets antsy in the springtime but

44
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,409
try to avoid this particular situation

45
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,909
here some basics timing the cover crop

46
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,920
kill what the main crop is important

47
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,680
here you can see your main crop in a

48
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,079
cover crop killed that timing as you'll

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,170
see again is also important to get

50
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,879
everything the maximum efficiency on le

51
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,430
the cover crop to help protect the soil

52
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,899
but also for a preparing the field to

53
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,810
get your main crop in there's you can

54
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,769
get ideally a yield and make some money

55
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,060
from that crop that you did plant it all

56
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,640
comes back to having the plan that's

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,269
where the winter is so important plan is

58
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,610
just an idea

59
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,439
to progress you forward so that mean you

60
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,080
have to follow the exact same order of

61
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,009
the plan but having that plan gives a

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,290
lot of growers come

63
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,628
and this helps you out in the long range

64
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:20,908
of things gives you just that checkpoint

65
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:22,439
where am I in my head my behind

66
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,789
odds are you're probably always gonna

67
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,699
think you're behind but are you getting

68
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:28,620
stuff done and I'm going through and

69
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,389
trying to avoid some of the errors that

70
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,700
you may have had in the past that your

71
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:34,738
plan kind of outlined be flexible with

72
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,899
the conditions some Springs start very

73
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,409
early some start late some are rainy

74
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,969
some are dry but have a way to try and

75
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:43,590
avoid forgetting something

76
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,098
so there's certain key things that you

77
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,659
definitely need to do try to have those

78
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:51,839
in the forefront on a white board

79
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:54,299
something it's a walk by each day things

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
can always change but if you forgot

81
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,629
something last year you forgot to hook

82
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,159
up irrigation lines or prep something

83
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:00,318
make sure you don't make that mistake

84
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,789
twice

85
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,039
consumer comes to be important to be

86
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,750
able to prioritize things hard to have a

87
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,090
plan to do this but ask yourself is this

88
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,409
the best use of my time or just

89
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,430
convenient at the moment have a little

90
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:13,409
dead space and just kind of want to go

91
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,409
and do this but this is the best use of

92
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:19,469
my time this kind of set me up for later

93
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:21,449
in the season if I do it now we'll have

94
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:23,639
to do it later anyway you know if I'm

95
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:25,828
gonna go through and the weeds are just

96
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,120
kind of starting in the field and go

97
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,739
through and I want to tell them well I

98
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
might have to go back next week and till

99
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,419
the MINIX I'm not gonna plant until two

100
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,129
weeks so prioritize don't do things

101
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,280
twice trying to do it once do it well

102
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,949
and move on and does it does this need

103
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,019
to get done now will there be seedlings

104
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,119
ready to be planted in an unprepped row

105
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,620
for the next week are you prepping a row

106
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,209
that you're have to reap rep because you

107
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,819
know your seedlings your transplants may

108
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,780
not be ready since that prioritizing

109
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:54,298
this is where it comes a little

110
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,859
experience knowing what you have known

111
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,870
what's coming up trying to plant it into

112
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:00,689
the weather you're just trying to use

113
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,789
your time as efficiently as possible and

114
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,889
timing is everything if it's possible

115
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:05,818
working teams focus on one task at a

116
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:08,519
time

117
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:10,168
get it done personally I feel kind of

118
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,090
the best way to approach something is if

119
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:13,680
you're tilling and laying plastic for

120
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,009
example something very common a lot of

121
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,048
farms do do teal till the one two three

122
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:21,029
and four fields today and then tomorrow

123
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,129
you just like plastic and fields one two

124
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,709
three and four already you till field

125
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:27,060
one and then my plastic and field one

126
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:27,689
until field two in the plastic and field

127
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,220
two

128
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,469
now this depends on a lot of things but

129
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,420
typically it's an ideal time to tell oh

130
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,010
you go through distill them all just hit

131
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,110
them all once and then come back

132
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,240
tomorrow switches the tractor over and

133
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,080
puts a plastic layer and go through and

134
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,610
do all the fields

135
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,529
now there's separated by a great

136
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,650
distance it might be more advantageous

137
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:47,189
to till one than lay plastic on one

138
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:49,139
ideally you'd have two different

139
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:51,060
tractors for this purpose and want to

140
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,469
keep switching equipment and again this

141
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,810
is where that timing comes into being

142
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,760
everything teams are a great thing if

143
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,490
you can kind of coordinate and work on

144
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,629
and all dedicate yourselves to a task

145
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,699
but you kind of want to stay focused on

146
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,589
one thing here by tilling all the fields

147
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,149
in the same day you're just focused on

148
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:07,739
one thing

149
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:09,329
and then put the tiller away and clean

150
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,920
the tiller up you can rinse it down and

151
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:12,899
grease the fittings would be good then

152
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,550
go back grab your plastic layer grab

153
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,469
that tractor and make sure you have

154
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,540
enough plastic set up all the all the

155
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,280
rolls and just go through each lay

156
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,580
plastic on your perfectly tilled fields

157
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,769
from the day before so again be flexible

158
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:28,019
keep in mind timings everything I know

159
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:30,060
you always think that you're behind keep

160
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:33,589
working at it have a plan and hopefully

161
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,589
things go smoother here to here
