00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,000
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,399
going to be looking at when you test

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
candidate plant material for potency and

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,599
it results in a number

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,920
what are some of the specifics that go

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,920
along with that

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,600
all right let's look at testing cannabis

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,799
plants potency resulting in a number

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,359
so first off when we're looking at

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,439
providing that exact number

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,039
to provide a reliable number the dried

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,679
canvas flower material needs to be

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,399
ground up

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,159
mixed together into a homogenized sample

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,000
this helps to ensure that all of the

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,558
individual flower variability

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,439
is easily averaged in the final tested

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,199
product

19
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,159
overall this results in a consistent

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,920
sample and allows for an accurate number

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,519
to be provided now with that homogenized

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
samples we suggest a representative

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
example

24
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,799
here however while this sample is great

25
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,519
for consistency in the analysis

26
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,718
this is often not how people want to or

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,879
are accustomed to

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,759
consuming their cannabis they may want

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,759
to have that

30
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,359
original solid dry flower they don't

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,400
want to deal with some sort of

32
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,719
diced up small subsample

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
they want the actual original basically

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,359
dry flower

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,439
but there can be flower to flower

36
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,359
inconsistencies that do not allow for a

37
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,679
consistent number to be given

38
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,680
it technically should be an expected

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,280
range i have another video on this if

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
you want to search the channel

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,118
to look for that if you're looking at

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
providing that consistent single number

43
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,719
in order to provide accurate results you

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,280
need a homogenized sample to provide a

45
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,719
number

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,920
for the potency of that exact sample

47
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,759
now that blended flour the results in a

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,840
number on a homogenized product

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,118
that most people do not want to purchase

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,399
you can see here

51
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,319
also encapsulated form here this can be

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,640
great for other cannabis end products

53
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,959
that number particularly concentrates

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,960
and also like pre-rolls but this is not

55
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,478
for a single dry flower which typically

56
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,239
brings the highest price

57
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,319
so if you're getting a consistent you

58
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,519
know purchasing an exact flower

59
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,399
with an exact number realize that the

60
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,799
really expected might be a slight range

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,800
from

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,599
that number because as you know

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,640
individual flowers will have slight

64
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,959
individual variabilities in uniqueness

65
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,719
to each flower so that's why it's hard

66
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,719
to have an exact number that correlates

67
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,719
even though we do see it with dry flour

68
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:30,639
it really needs to be performed to be an

69
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,639
accurate result on a homogenized sample
