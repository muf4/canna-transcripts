1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
so I'm going to go through the basic

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,330
harvest process for cannabis as we see

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,120
that has occurred on the plants in this

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,240
image right here so first one the

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,320
general process got four basic steps

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,210
step one is to reduce or stop

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,940
fertilizing one or two weeks before the

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,560
anticipated harvest date now the length

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,359
of time can depend on the growing media

10
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,849
and the fertilizer regimen that the

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,590
grower is choosing to use typically for

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,920
soils you're looking at the one a two

13
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:30,420
week span of time for cocoa Clara about

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,030
weighting about its seven-day or about

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,689
it that week or so timeframe for hydro

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,010
may only be one to two days so again the

17
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:40,320
area that you're growing in may

18
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,599
influence that and also the

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,980
aggressiveness or the degree of

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,710
fertilizer that is being applied by the

21
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,750
chosen grower so after reduce or stop

22
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,370
fertilizing I'm looking at flushing the

23
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,789
plants with enough water to have about

24
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:55,320
25% leave the root zone as excess so in

25
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,780
this case for indoor operations you want

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,399
to catch pan to allow that to occur for

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,719
outdoor applications you're looking at

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,120
that a little bit extra water that

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,829
you're adding to flush the nutrients

30
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,868
flush the water beyond the root zone

31
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,420
behind where those roots are capable of

32
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:12,090
taking that up they'll reduce the

33
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,450
potential for unwanted fertilizer in the

34
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,040
buds or plant next step is to remove the

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,380
entire plant at the base this is a

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,618
downward image here cut right the base

37
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,239
for an outdoor operation with pruners be

38
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:25,950
careful not to disturb the buds which

39
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,828
could impact trichome structures in

40
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,469
resins here we're seeing the basic plant

41
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:34,258
structure left in place and pruned off

42
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:36,509
here starting at the outside working its

43
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,430
way to the core gonna be careful not to

44
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,049
lay the whole plant on the ground here

45
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,990
in particular problem with potential

46
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,159
outdoor operations because that may kind

47
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,349
of mess at some of the structures and

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,079
the resins here that the plants spend a

49
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,789
lot of time creating lastly I want to

50
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,758
manicure the buds taking care remove all

51
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,380
small leaves with sharp scissors here

52
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,978
and you could see you have an area to

53
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:00,629
store them I can dry them but this is

54
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:03,328
where a little bit of that manual labor

55
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:05,459
does come in this can be kind of a

56
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:07,500
time-consuming process here there are

57
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,258
automate automate adoptions for larger

58
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,419
operations this is kind of the general

59
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,039
kind of recommendation here this summary

60
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,958
adds a little bit of a care

61
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,000
fully plans kind of coordinated event

62
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,370
here they got a chess match because

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,408
they're trying to or ultimately your

64
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,019
goal is to maximize the production here

65
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,578
that you have now this bud trimming and

66
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,920
manicuring that takes place with those

67
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,750
small detailed scissors and it's advised

68
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,119
and that's grower preference there as

69
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,469
far as what scissors you use now when

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,539
you are cutting the plants down on a

71
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:38,639
larger scale want to make sure you are

72
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,289
cutting them at the crown or something

73
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,388
moving large branches is the most

74
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:43,560
efficient the main root ball can be left

75
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:45,959
in the container as this does not

76
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,549
contain any valuable cannabinoids so

77
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,378
cutting it right down here soil line

78
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,510
we're just removing the buds here will

79
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:54,298
ensure you're getting the maximum amount

80
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:56,459
of cannabinoids post-harvest bud

81
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,469
trimming as I mentioned should have the

82
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,299
smaller leaves pruned helps us be the

83
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:03,000
drying process out we want to leave it

84
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,188
all kind of there Mike chopped unwanted

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,318
moisture and it could be a site for a

86
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:09,150
potential mold to develop this is a

87
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:10,798
labor-intensive process again there are

88
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,599
automated machines that can help do the

89
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,069
majority of the initial work there is

90
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,500
usually quality control it does come in

91
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,878
at the end and all this process should

92
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,949
be purged shortly after harvest

93
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,408
shouldn't be waiting a long time to do

94
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,120
this bud trimming process now the

95
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:25,888
equipment for bud trimming typically

96
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,169
wearing disposable gloves of some kind

97
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:31,199
having good scissors pointed ends are

98
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:33,599
recommended was e with even the variety

99
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,790
of a good idea to maximize the finished

100
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,198
production sometimes you could have can

101
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:40,078
I do an initial trim and in a more

102
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,879
detailed trim now you are saving the

103
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,069
buds but you do want to potentially save

104
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,168
these trimmings to improve the overall

105
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:49,018
yield and can be made into hash or other

106
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,180
concentrates so the areas close to the

107
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,629
buds may be trimmed out but they still

108
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,729
may have elevated levels of anoints that

109
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:58,759
are worth saving in going through some

110
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,199
further purification process

111
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,759
lastly saving the trimmings is suggested

112
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,949
to improve the total yield it could be

113
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,560
made into hash rather concentrates and

114
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,419
that is important because rather than

115
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,329
throwing this away won't may not be as

116
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:15,689
potent as the actual buds it can be a

117
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,848
way to help increase overall yields and

118
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,560
to try to recoup some of the expenses

119
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:22,668
and time and labor that you spent

120
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,668
cultivating the crop
