1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,839
so you're interested in learning more

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,960
about using fuel oil to heat a cannabis

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,399
grow facility

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,080
well you've come to the right place here

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:17,449
at tobacco university because that's

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:18,560
just what i'm going to explain here

7
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:20,079
[Music]

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,320
all right let's get into the details of

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,358
using fuel oil to heat a cannabis grow

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,599
facility

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,039
well first off with any oil we want to

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,079
be considered it might take into

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,359
considerations

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,839
particularly with oil we want to

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,920
consider the oil tank that's going to be

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,439
required to be on site

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,120
this is an above ground storage tank

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,599
that must have a containment in the

19
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,399
event

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,280
of a leak or a spill this is an outdoor

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,120
storage

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,399
pumping the oil out in cold winter

23
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,119
months could be a problem

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,799
could gel insulated tanks or additives

25
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,439
to the fuel to protect against this

26
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,679
hazard

27
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,799
need to be implemented so it's not just

28
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,799
kind of that always oh

29
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,479
like the gasoline in your car oil

30
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,000
storage tanks sometimes can have issues

31
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,479
in that cold winter months if

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,238
not pre-treated the oil can actually gel

33
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,280
in the tank and cause it to become

34
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,719
unburnable there's number two oil which

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
is home heating oil

36
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,158
which you're most familiar with if you

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,799
have oil to heat your house or facility

38
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,240
already

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,840
this is number two oil is nearly

40
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,158
identical to diesel engine

41
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,280
fuel it's a relatively clean fuel that

42
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,600
demands

43
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,599
slightly more burner maintenance than a

44
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,199
gas burner in comparison

45
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,118
it's cleaner due to the recent switch in

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,680
the united states to ultra low sulfur

47
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,920
fuel

48
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,520
that's just caused to become cleaner not

49
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,040
100 clean but at least

50
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,519
cleaner at least an improvement of what

51
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,880
it was then we have number four

52
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,000
and number six fuel oils these oils have

53
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,478
higher heating value

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,599
than the number two fuel oil but require

55
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,679
preheating

56
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,719
and a greater attention to equipment

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
operation

58
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,239
because they're more viscous which means

59
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,239
they're thicker than number two

60
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:55,359
oil contracting for the winter fuels

61
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,199
uh fuel needs to be when prices are low

62
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,118
which is typically in august you want to

63
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,759
get those contracts in and signed

64
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,359
usually around august or early september

65
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,959
because this can cause considerable

66
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,718
savings and money and ensure that you

67
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,239
have a supply for the winter

68
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,840
this is not something you just buy

69
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
necessarily on demand

70
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
is definitely advantageous to go through

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
and seek a contract out towards the end

72
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,318
of summer

73
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,840
then lastly there is waste oil so waste

74
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,039
oil comes from the collection centers

75
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
from cars and trucks

76
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,120
some of this oil is cleaned and reused

77
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,360
for lubrication much of it is available

78
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,719
as

79
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,319
fuel at a few cents per gallon waste oil

80
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,239
that has not been processed requires a

81
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,518
settling tank to trap water and sludge

82
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,759
that might be present

83
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,680
these have to be disposed of to me epa

84
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,120
regulations do their classification as a

85
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,200
hazardous waste

86
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,680
therefore waste oil has a heat

87
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,518
equivalent about 150 000 btus per gallon

88
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,000
which is very similar to number two

89
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,360
fuel oil so again it can be a lot

90
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,878
cheaper to get potentially

91
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
does require some other specialized

92
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,239
equipment so all of these are sub

93
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,878
categories

94
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,840
under adding fuel oil as a heat source

95
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,878
for a cannabis

96
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,878
grow facility
