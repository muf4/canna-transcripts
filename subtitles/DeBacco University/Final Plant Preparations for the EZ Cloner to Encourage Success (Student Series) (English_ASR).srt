00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to this debaco university

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,240
student series video we're going to look

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,800
at final plant preparations for the easy

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,800
cloner to encourage success

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,480
now there are a couple key things you

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
need to do this video will walk you

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,160
through those steps but hopefully you've

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,480
got everything taken care of as far as

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,719
mechanics go harvested your plants and

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,240
now this will help you increase the odds

11
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,239
of rooting success for your plants

12
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,759
[Music]

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,479
so now we're going to take the clones

14
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:39,439
that we just cut from the field

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,359
pick one out from the water

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,599
and we got to prepare it to go into the

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,679
cloner so as you can see this one's a

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,840
little tall for our operation we don't

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,920
want the top getting burnt so we're

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,039
going to cut it down to a better size to

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,520
fit our

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,520
cloner

23
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,159
so i'm going to choose to cut it from

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,399
the next node up which is right about

25
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,398
here

26
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,478
just discard the bottom

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,479
next i'm going to get the foam collar

28
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,438
ready to go about

29
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,679
an inch up the branch from the bottom of

30
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,519
the branch

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,159
be sure to be careful when putting it in

32
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,158
we don't want to break the branch

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,400
then you're going to take your claw next

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,840
rooting solution

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,840
and dip the bottom in

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,359
this will allow for the roots to callus

37
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,719
quicker

38
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,599
now it can be moved into its new home

39
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,599
and start growing again

40
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,039
for this plant specifically we kind of

41
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,959
have a lot going on down at the bottom

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,600
so i'm going to choose to take

43
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,519
one of these branches off

44
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,359
now based on the damage that this one

45
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,519
has it has some

46
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,438
looks like bug damage looks like a bug

47
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,959
went in and ate that a little bit

48
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:05,039
i'm just gonna take that leaf off

49
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,438
so as if you're taking a clone just try

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,599
to get as close to the branch as

51
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,079
possible

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,079
and snip

53
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,519
now that we have a little bit more area

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,800
to work with

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,879
we could take

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,840
the foam collar

57
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,719
and try to give it as much space on the

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,640
bottom

59
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,439
as possible so i'm going to go all the

60
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,439
way up here

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,719
next i'm going to take our clonex

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,439
rooting solution

63
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,359
and dip the bottom in

64
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,280
this allows for the rooting on the

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,840
bottom to begin callousing quicker than

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,840
it would without it

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,120
so now i'm going to place

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,319
the clone

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,319
into its new house

70
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,238
now you may be wondering how this is

71
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,598
efficient considering that it's bending

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,878
over this way

73
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,719
but luckily

74
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,719
after it's spent some time in the cloner

75
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,039
due to tropism it's going to start

76
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,080
looking back up towards the light so

77
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,759
it's

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,760
leaning is not something that we have to

79
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,598
worry about

80
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,878
so as you can see we've reached the

81
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,878
final step of setting up our cloner

82
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,280
we've put every single one of our clones

83
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,679
that we've found outside into the cloner

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,158
adjusted them accordingly by cutting

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,200
them a little bit adding clonex to the

86
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,120
ends

87
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,079
now you can see that they're looking a

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,158
little sad a little droopy but it's not

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,959
to worry it's just because they were

90
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,039
just moved from an outside environment

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,360
to a sterile inside environment it's

92
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,959
kind of a big change for them especially

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,879
since they're no longer on the mother

94
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,239
plant they're pretty much left to fend

95
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,639
for themselves so

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,719
if you see over the next night morning

97
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,318
even the next day that they're seeing

98
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,158
seeming a little droopy that's

99
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,839
completely normal just give them a

100
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,598
little bit of time make sure the

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
nutrients and conductivity are where

102
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,000
they're supposed to be and you should be

103
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,000
all set

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
you
