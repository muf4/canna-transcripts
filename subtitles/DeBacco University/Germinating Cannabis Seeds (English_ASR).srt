1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,000
okay here I'm gonna go through the

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,068
process of properly germinating a

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,810
cannabis seed so hopefully you can take

4
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:08,550
a seed and turn it into a nice healthy

5
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:11,070
looking seedling like the one pictured

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,660
here so what does germination let's

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,910
first define that it's a development of

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,649
a plant from a dormant seed this is not

9
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,198
the same as emergence which is when the

10
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:21,239
sprout actually breaks the soil so seeds

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,609
can germinate but not emerge and this is

12
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,989
important note here these are

13
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:26,699
germinating seeds is that when you're

14
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:28,018
looking at the germination percentage

15
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,689
that's usually provided by companies

16
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:33,359
it's only the percentage that actually

17
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,850
produced in this case a small root it

18
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,640
does not mean that this they emerged

19
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,210
from this soil so germination rate will

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,859
always be higher than emergence rate so

21
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,628
how deep to plant this is important so

22
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,250
that you have the increased odds of

23
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,689
emergence because you don't want to

24
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,340
plant the receives too deep because the

25
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,039
seeds will run out of energy reserves

26
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,660
before it can emerge and start utilizing

27
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,270
light energy to further photosynthetic

28
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:00,808
process typically when a plants seeds

29
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,000
only about 1/8 to 1/4 inch 3 mils to six

30
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:06,090
bills deep rule of thumb is to plant the

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,859
seed twice as deep as the width so 1/8

32
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,740
inch seeds we printed about quarter

33
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,239
inches deep here see in this image

34
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,798
hearing and judicial and planting in

35
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,359
soil this would be much too deep for

36
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,520
canvass seeds because they'll run out of

37
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,469
energy before they can emerge out of the

38
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,750
soil so what's the germination process

39
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:25,170
requiring what acquires a see that has

40
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,810
oli genetics and it should be a quality

41
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,549
seed on top of the genetics you need

42
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,129
seeds that have this kind of dark

43
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,780
coloration and are full these typically

44
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:37,679
come from a known source it's helpful

45
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,450
for increase the odds of quality now

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,790
what defines a quality seed well you can

47
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,368
see very consistent conditions here but

48
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,159
the presence of stored nutrients so even

49
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:48,540
these full seeds here have a limited

50
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,130
amount of energy stored in their

51
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,020
endosperm that's what gives the seeds

52
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,089
the energy to emerge out of the soil

53
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:57,298
before they shed that seed coat and are

54
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,649
able to capture light energy if planted

55
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,259
at the proper depth energy would be

56
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,780
deserves will allow the emergence out of

57
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,930
this soil and again quality seed nice

58
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,699
consistent conditions we see here the

59
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,500
seeds only need water heat and air to

60
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,539
germinate which sounds really easy but

61
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,830
having the right amount and ratio of

62
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,389
those is important

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,100
for water soaking seeds can speed up

64
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,439
water infiltration but this is not

65
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,629
required when water does enter the seeds

66
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,310
it will cause hormones for example tuber

67
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,799
Ellen's to activate and produce this

68
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,770
radical radical pops this is the first

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,630
sign of determination has started for

70
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,790
temperature more temperatures not better

71
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:33,900
the goals to maintain about 78 to 82

72
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:35,579
degrees Fahrenheit

73
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,770
to increase the odds of successful

74
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,630
germination if temperatures reach to 90

75
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,100
degrees in greater this can kill the

76
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,780
seeds and prevent germination from

77
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,909
occurring system essentially roast the

78
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,849
seeds in denature vital proteins

79
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:52,020
preventing this radical formation of the

80
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,969
seeds air seeds need to breathe they

81
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,620
especially need oxygen so over soak and

82
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,780
then we'll literally suffocate them so

83
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,509
you examle example to scuba diver here

84
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,979
seeds need to breathe they need to have

85
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:03,929
that kind of air exchange that's

86
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,969
occurring if you just soak them in water

87
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,310
and kind of drown them that can be able

88
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:11,699
to exchange important oxygen for the

89
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,890
process of respiration advice if you are

90
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:15,269
going to see it so providing time for

91
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,509
seeds and so can work can help increase

92
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,790
germination rates purified distilled ro

93
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,769
which is reverse osmosis or a quality

94
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:25,439
tap water can all be used there's no one

95
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,790
preferred source some growers may even

96
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,590
put some seaweed or kelp to help the

97
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:31,139
process along but again this is not

98
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,060
necessary Sookie needs no more than 12

99
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,529
to 18 hours is recommended do this if

100
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,449
you soak in the bath for too long your

101
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,340
fingers will get pruney we don't want to

102
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,129
drown the seeds and over saturate the

103
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,840
water inside them

104
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:45,269
you may notice if you do soak your seeds

105
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,129
some may sink over time which indicates

106
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,500
a fully developed sea denser heavier

107
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,060
those that float typically are hollow

108
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,280
and have poor in this burn development

109
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,489
the result is typically reduced

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,289
germination rates scarification is

111
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,909
weakening the seed coat which increases

112
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:02,159
water infiltration to improve

113
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:03,659
termination rates by carefully sanding

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,329
the outer surface of the seed coke and a

115
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,859
lot easier water penetration they're

116
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,480
essentially taking away that solid

117
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,970
texture and just a little sandpaper

118
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,009
allowing water to get inside the seed a

119
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:15,479
little bit more efficiently however if

120
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:18,329
you do over sand them you can damage the

121
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,349
delicate embryo inside and that Satan

122
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,298
could cause a delay in water

123
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,210
infiltration which could reduce or

124
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:26,189
increase germination time with scarves

125
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:27,659
scarf eight seeds a soaking time can

126
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:31,350
often be reduced or may not

127
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,960
be needed in some cases you can direct

128
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,150
CDs as a preferred method moisture

129
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,379
initiates the germination process so if

130
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,849
you're planting that image saturating

131
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,290
the media ahead of time that should

132
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,480
provide adequate moisture levels to

133
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,860
initiate the germination process over

134
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,300
saturating the media will suffocate the

135
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,889
seeds there's no need for additional

136
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,020
hormones or even kelp to aid in this

137
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,539
process distilled water is advised for

138
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,799
consistency and lack of additives the

139
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,629
key part here is having everything

140
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,189
prepared ahead of time you can see even

141
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:58,500
the corner of the middle and the side

142
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:00,600
cells here are all even moisture

143
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,000
throughout that's important to allow

144
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,200
even a germination process and not

145
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,430
having wet over the wet or dry spots

146
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,199
some growers have heard this paper towel

147
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,910
method this is a discouraged method for

148
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,889
Candida seeds it's a process that

149
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,320
involves starting seeds in moisten paper

150
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,879
towel prior to adding to media this

151
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,349
allows you to see the radical produced

152
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,120
in transplants easy to know have

153
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,500
germinated so of course think is the

154
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,540
advantage and while that is true

155
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,209
this process is discouraged because

156
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,450
increase of odds of dirt damaged to that

157
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:32,669
very newly formed radical this method is

158
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:35,339
best suited for plants that have large

159
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,790
seeds reduce large roots chemists does

160
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,659
not fall into that category

161
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,980
environmental factors some believe that

162
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,780
you can increase the percentage of

163
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,610
female plants by adjusting nutrients in

164
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,500
light none of these have supporting

165
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,290
science and genders turn my genes

166
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,819
some say increasing nitrogen immediately

167
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,770
lower K levels or in the first weeks

168
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,839
will make plants turn female that the

169
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,849
case ensuring plants receive more blue

170
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,159
than red light for about 14 and 16 hours

171
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,200
not going to influence male or female

172
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,520
plant and reduce plant stress to

173
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,310
increase the chance of producing female

174
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,599
plants again false statement there and

175
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,720
not going to influence whether that

176
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,980
seedlings going to be male or female

177
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,240
radical production so in about three to

178
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,830
eight days the seeds will produce a

179
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,918
radical in your Caden determination

180
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:18,329
process has been initiated her much as

181
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,799
you may want to see this happen the best

182
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:21,599
places for this to happen directly in

183
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,090
the media you want to be transferring

184
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,890
these seed because see how small some of

185
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:29,699
these radicals are the damage the odds

186
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:31,800
of damage are great during that transfer

187
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,959
process may lead to damaging and if you

188
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,759
break this radical in a stunt or even

189
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,889
kill your new perspective plants

190
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,788
remember it's not like sunlight or be

191
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:40,079
disturbed

192
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:41,899
this is why it's best suits put them in

193
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,829
the media and let them be

194
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:45,388
that meeting that you're using this

195
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:49,079
hopefully a propagation or germination

196
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:51,120
mix this is a finer mix it's a finer

197
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,099
kind of substrate here and allows for

198
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,139
better soil moisture contact with the

199
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,850
small seeds less air pockets will

200
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,038
develop causing more consistent

201
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,479
conditions for your ceilings a groin

202
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:01,889
media score certainly result in

203
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:03,719
potentially dry pockets reduced your

204
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,939
germination rate so for the germination

205
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,360
profit process uses a germination or a

206
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:10,110
propagation mix brothel can also be used

207
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,788
for germination

208
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,770
there's tubes that can use it's

209
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:15,209
essentially inert material McLeod for

210
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,769
students to be directly planted into

211
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,538
larger containers with minimal root

212
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,490
disturbance there are some companies

213
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,409
that make a small area you put your seed

214
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,150
in there in larger blocks that easily

215
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,949
can accept the smaller blocks they're

216
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:27,719
three girls if you're chosen meat it's

217
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:29,550
important to precip the material and

218
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,500
have it ready before you soak your seeds

219
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,939
get everything ready and then start the

220
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,589
seeds don't do it the other way around

221
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,209
in case you're missing something once

222
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,009
you start those seeds in water the

223
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:40,430
germination process ideally will be

224
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,430
demisch you
