1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
okay here I'm will be showing you two

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,240
ways you can protect your plants one

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,518
then is in the insect netting and one of

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,219
them is going to be reflective mulch and

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,169
here so in Sec netting I think it's

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,239
going to be a wave of the future because

7
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,948
it's the only item that will work a

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,039
hundred percent assuming that's

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,230
installed properly this physical barrier

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,480
between the insects and the plants

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,028
eliminate the need for any applications

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,618
on the leaves and this also works 24

13
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:31,649
hours a day whether it's a very rainy

14
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,659
spring or whether it's a very dry spray

15
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:36,000
enough to keep applying anything works

16
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,869
great in raised bed situations as we see

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,950
here and also in long field applications

18
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:43,738
now in second etting there's different

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,930
mesh sizes to control certain insects so

20
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,399
the finer mesh sizes are advised if

21
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,439
we're trying to control really small

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,070
things like aphids would be an example

23
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,530
in larger typically less expensive

24
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,929
larger mesh sizes can you use for larger

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,058
insects it depends on what insect you're

26
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:01,469
specifically trying to control will

27
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,558
determine what insect in and you

28
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,599
purchase now it's more than just a crop

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,149
cover it's also highly recommended to

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,658
install in your season extenders so for

31
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,830
example your high tunnels doorways in L

32
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,170
venting sides fans anything that you

33
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,509
have in greenhouses this should be all

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,670
covered with insect netting maintaining

35
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,200
that physical separation if you're gonna

36
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,340
put it on a door don't have to make it

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,310
in a hinge door because they can get

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,659
stuck open or be left open have some way

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,879
that you can have to lift maybe a

40
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,460
portion of the net to get in and so it

41
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,679
self closes this physical barrier is not

42
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,868
a new idea so while it's being newly

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,850
applied for insects bird netting on

44
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:44,099
grapes is very common to keep birds out

45
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,978
from picking away at all the wonderful

46
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,030
grapes before they're harvested the

47
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:49,048
other thing I want to mention for

48
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,450
protecting your plants would be

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,610
reflective Malta's this would be silver

50
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,439
plastic reflects sunlight is that the

51
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:57,000
same as grey plastic so I had to farming

52
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,398
it into that issue where I want the

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,629
silver the shiny the chrome when you

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,909
apply it be sure you wear sunglasses

55
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:05,420
even on cloudy days because it does

56
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,859
reflect the Sun and it is quite bright

57
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,899
the goal is to confuse so how do these

58
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,848
work those goals to confuse insects so

59
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,860
they cannot tell where the protective

60
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:15,659
underside of the leaf is so

61
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,180
great first trips which are common pests

62
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,729
on onions we see here even though this

63
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,680
is not 100% all reflected there's that

64
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:25,349
black strip running down the center it's

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,390
still advantageous so even though we've

66
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,340
thought the multis may not be 100%

67
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:32,069
effective if you're going to apply a

68
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,460
plastic kind of barrier here for a weed

69
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,289
suppression it's worth a consideration

70
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,180
because it can aid in reducing

71
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:41,789
especially when plants are small at

72
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,390
reducing the chance of 3rd pressure on

73
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:44,389
onions
