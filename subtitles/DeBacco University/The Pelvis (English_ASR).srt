1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,710
continuing with our skeletal system or

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,240
if arrived at the pelvis and we're going

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,550
to learn about the bones that are fused

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,050
together that make up this structure

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,740
that you may have heard of called

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,839
the hip bone so these hip bones it's

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,060
important that they're very strong and

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,070
maintain their integrity because the

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,890
total weight of the upper body rests on

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,539
this region this region also protects

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,689
several organs such as the reproductive

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,539
organs the urinary bladder and portions

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,020
of the large intestine also the area

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,179
where that femur articulates with so the

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,920
pelvis is composed of three fused bones

16
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,170
these are not independently mobile they

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,899
are fused together with the ilium

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:49,649
located here the ischium located here in

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,808
purple and then the pubic bone so and

20
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,698
that's okay too right here the sacrum

21
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,919
which is in green here and here anterior

22
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,259
and posterior view is part of the

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,689
vertebra so it's important that we make

24
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,670
that distinction of separation is

25
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,829
technically not part of the pelvis

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,478
region here that hippo you could see

27
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,090
here again our three bones composed

28
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,959
together fuse together make that hip

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,150
bone up

30
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,669
remember that sacrum is part of the

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,118
vertebral column it is not part of the

32
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,090
total hip bone gender differences of the

33
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:23,368
pelvis so if you want to identify a

34
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,978
skeleton as being male or female you

35
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:28,349
typically look at the hip bone here now

36
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,900
rather than memorize degrees and numbers

37
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,149
for women it's 80 to 85 a little bit

38
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,090
wider angle what's up with the birthing

39
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,400
process and men 50 to 60 degrees there's

40
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,700
kind of little tricked here so if you

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,590
take your hand and the angle formed the

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,590
pubic arch is approximately the angle

43
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,810
between the thumb and index finger that

44
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,240
would be indicated that would be a woman

45
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,590
the skeleton however if the angle

46
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,280
between the index finger and the middle

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,530
finger if it matches this then we're

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,649
looking at it's probably a male so this

49
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,799
can help you identify quickly a male or

50
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:08,128
female skeleton by simply looking at the

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:12,229
pelvis in the degree that we find here

52
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,228
at the pubic arch
