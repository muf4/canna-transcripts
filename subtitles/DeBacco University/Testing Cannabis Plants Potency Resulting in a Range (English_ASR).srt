1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,439
going to be looking at testing canvas

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,240
plants potency with the resulting data

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,800
provided as

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,359
a range while this may not typically be

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,960
seen

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,599
we're going to go over why that might be

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,359
important to be considering the potency

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,920
of canvas plants in a range

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,320
and not necessarily a single defined

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,320
number

12
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:31,198
[Music]

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,280
all right let's get into testing canvas

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,880
plants potency resulting in a range and

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,759
we kind of see that represented here

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,679
we're looking at

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,119
percentage weight over total weight for

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,200
thca to

19
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,159
see in total here we see all these

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,039
little data points

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,679
we can see that while the hard line here

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,359
might be the

23
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,159
number provided we could see the

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,238
variability that might exist

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,679
and that's why we need to be considering

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,000
this final product as

27
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,960
a range and not necessarily just one

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,159
single defined chemical number

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,878
so providing that range well with actual

30
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,759
plant

31
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,640
product material that's tested a range

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,960
is to be really

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,478
expected as there's no two flowers that

34
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,719
are exactly alike

35
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,039
even if they come from the same plant

36
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,478
grown in the exact same conditions

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
this seems to be logical when it comes

38
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:18,560
to understanding the plant but a range

39
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,640
can make

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,079
regulation as well as compliance with

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,320
laws and standards

42
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,000
much more challenging this is why

43
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,000
there's such a push for the results to

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
be expressed as a single number

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,118
if you want to learn more about that i

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,000
have another video on describing

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:37,680
the single number idea but here we see

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,478
thc of 19.7 to 22.2

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,759
range provided cbd provided as a range

50
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,239
because this is a

51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,799
plant product it is as has some slight

52
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,399
degree of

53
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,079
variation hopefully that range will not

54
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,560
be very broad

55
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,679
but it is kind of unfair to represent it

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,640
as an exact

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,680
number and we're particularly looking at

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,560
dry flour

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,280
so the premium canvas end product is dry

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,719
flour

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,718
most people like this because of the

62
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,959
unique properties of each and the fact

63
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,599
that they often get to select the one

64
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,079
the ones here that they exactly want

65
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,239
however

66
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
this variability makes providing a

67
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,080
consistent number a challenge

68
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,400
in regards to potency there's a reason

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,840
why numbers provided should be expressed

70
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
as a general range

71
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
no two flowers would be exactly like

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,439
they're grown in slightly different

73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,719
portions of the plant

74
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,359
different light exposure the difference

75
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,280
between them

76
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,400
should be minimal but there still will

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,318
be a difference

78
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,360
which is the advocation for the

79
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:36,000
expression of cannabis plant potency

80
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
as a range instead of a number but as

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,560
mentioned

82
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,840
that does make regulations very

83
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,159
challenging and laws

84
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,159
that want to have a set fixed point so

85
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,120
you need that number to kind of go

86
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,000
line and match that set of regulation or

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
law

88
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,598
so that's part of the challenges here

89
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,759
but just want you to understand here as

90
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,079
part of your cannabis education

91
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,359
that dry flower probably well maybe

92
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,760
expressed as a number

93
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,720
might be more accurately represented as

94
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,719
a range
