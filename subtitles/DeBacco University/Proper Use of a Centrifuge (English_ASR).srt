1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,958
okay here I'm gonna go over the proper

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,878
use of a centrifuge and while they may

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,869
look different they all operate in the

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,160
same basic way so the basics centrifuge

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:13,500
is a piece of equipment that puts an

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,809
object and rotation or a fixed axis it

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,719
spins and the whole point is to separate

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:21,149
the substance of different densities the

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,799
denser substances as you see down here

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:24,599
will appear towards the bottom of the

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,210
tube and the less it has dense

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,820
substances will be up here so these can

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,500
be slightly different in density and by

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,780
spinning it at a certain rate for a

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,519
certain time you'll develop that kind of

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,010
tell it down there and allow that

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,399
separation technique and align up or

18
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:43,320
this off in most cases here AUSA version

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,629
by centrifuge solids can be separated

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,219
from solution in prime example this is

21
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,890
separating the blood into plasma and

22
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,539
cellular components so the plasma and

23
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,820
the buffer II of kind of leukocytes the

24
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,010
white blood cells with recites or the

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,948
red blood cells down here so well

26
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,750
initiate may look as one solid red kind

27
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:02,640
of liquid you spin it down you look at

28
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,469
this yellow portion called a plasma and

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,030
your observer sites or red blood cells

30
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,760
will be down at the bottom they are the

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,400
most ends there will be a thin layer so

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,740
you look carefully this kind of white

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,390
blood cells and some platelets as well

34
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,810
will be that yellow portion that's

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,819
simply all located in blood but through

36
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,420
the densities in the centrifuge process

37
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,069
you're able to separate those out

38
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:30,269
centrifuge safety because they do spin

39
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:32,789
at a very fast rate it's high rotational

40
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,099
speed or definitely in the thousands or

41
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,350
ten thousands even higher in some cases

42
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,879
they must be balanced or you run the

43
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:40,919
risk of damaging the equipment yourself

44
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,289
or items around it so even if you want

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,540
to centrifuge one thing you need to make

46
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,000
sure that the centrifuge is balanced in

47
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,159
the sense that the mass is the same on

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,599
both sides otherwise it'll get out of

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,310
balance and will walk itself off the

50
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,709
table can run into things concurrently

51
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,460
damage the rotor and equipment all bad

52
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:01,769
things and at the end whenever it's done

53
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,349
it's tempting but do not attempt to

54
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:06,750
touch or stop the spinning rotor by hand

55
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,609
or with another tool or object so a lot

56
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,139
of times the time I might go off you

57
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,260
lift it up and go grab your hands to

58
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,979
stop it and grab your equipment you want

59
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,658
to try to avoid

60
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:20,848
this at all costs reason being it could

61
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:23,818
spit at a very fast rate when I let it

62
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:25,378
slow down naturally because you're

63
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:28,500
putting pressure on one area on

64
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:30,479
especially the higher end balance points

65
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,878
might be damaging that rotor a little

66
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,609
bit or catching your finger on one of

67
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:39,060
the tubes here and just all bad things

68
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,560
there so setting up a centrifuge you

69
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,239
want to place the correct size and type

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,739
of tubes in the centrifuge some are

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,530
specifically made for the high rate of

72
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,599
spinning and you'll always want to use

73
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,530
at counter balance the counter balance

74
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:54,419
is by mass not my volume so as you put

75
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,509
you know 10 mils of something on one

76
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,798
side and its water great put water on

77
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:00,899
the other side you know what our base

78
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,030
you're in good shape but make sure it's

79
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,039
by mass not like volume that's we want

80
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,989
to keep it balanced using it sometimes

81
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,189
it's a lot denser than water you know

82
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,230
and someone just put water on the other

83
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,750
side because the volume might be the

84
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:13,979
same but the mass will not put the tubes

85
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,699
opposite of one another

86
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:19,679
as we kind of see here in the centrifuge

87
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:22,318
if you have more than two tubes only the

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,019
ones I will have the equal mass of these

89
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,030
two can des equal mass and these two can

90
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,950
have equal mass it does not mean these

91
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,719
all have the same mass these two need to

92
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:32,578
be equal and these two need to be equal

93
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,590
those that are directly across from one

94
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,000
another sometimes you do when

95
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,189
experiencer you're loading the entire

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,090
thing up and that's fine as long as the

97
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:43,739
masses are right around the same lastly

98
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,759
you want to enter the RPM revolutions

99
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,769
per minute it's an option I mean close

100
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,138
the lid so sometimes they are all preset

101
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,939
so no you can adjust the RPM I'll turn

102
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,380
the timer and press Start remove the

103
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,000
tubes carefully after center view has

104
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,299
completely stopped spinning to prevent

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,709
the mixing so some will be more stable

106
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,139
than others you want to carefully remove

107
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,598
those when ID can't remove that top

108
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,579
liquid portion sometimes things want to

109
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:11,189
keep that pellet want to extract that

110
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,959
whatever the protocol calls for just be

111
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:15,150
mindful of this is the proper way to

112
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,430
centrifuge so that you eliminate errors

113
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,430
in this separation technique
