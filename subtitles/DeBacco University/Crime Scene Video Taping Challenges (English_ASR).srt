1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,180
so often people will ask how come crime

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,649
scenes aren't just videotaped what's why

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,359
we've taken all these pictures why it's

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,980
taken a video of everything well it's a

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,980
lot of the challenges associated with

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,368
videotaping a particular crime scene go

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,778
over some of those here so the reason

8
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,028
why is that a few performers there needs

9
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:23,309
to be an accurate information with a

10
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:26,129
dense narration during the videotaping

11
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:28,018
process you can't simply just videotape

12
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,320
an area and to show that needs to be

13
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:33,109
also dense narration during that process

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,579
now while that narration is occurring

15
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:38,039
during the length of the entire video

16
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,049
segment there cannot be any editing

17
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,600
going on the video needs to be not

18
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:45,089
edited in order to uphold in court so

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,670
there is no anything there's no adding

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,079
there's no I forgot this and if you miss

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,059
any part of the narration as you're

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,710
going through and describing things that

23
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:54,329
can also get it thrown out of a

24
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,799
courtroom so the probably isn't why

25
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,370
they're not often used because there's

26
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,988
so much it needs to be included that

27
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:03,509
often times you could forget one little

28
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:06,420
thing and that could indicate the entire

29
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:06,989
use of that video for a particular crime

30
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,450
scene

31
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:12,780
now video documentation advantages is

32
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,000
that traffic violations or if you know

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,460
to kind of act as an evidence component

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,579
that is definitely advantageous also

35
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,769
using evidence of cameras tracking where

36
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,590
someone may be going in a car for the

37
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:28,259
timestamp that can be helpful in that

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,700
regards to say okay we went through this

39
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,950
intersection at this time going this

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,290
direction or then they go to another

41
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,850
camera and say okay they're here at this

42
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,280
time going at this speed and kind of

43
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,390
give an idea where they may have gone or

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,250
if we're looking here at traffic

45
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,840
violations where I see photo enforced

46
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,009
this is another area where video

47
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,790
documentation you can have its

48
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,319
advantages the disadvantage though can

49
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,810
record unwanted sounds there's

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,269
documented errors recorder may not know

51
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,100
what is necessary to include time and

52
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:58,649
date stamped may not be accurate and may

53
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,658
be a source of error all these small

54
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,790
details can cause an entire video to not

55
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,189
hold in court and these are some of the

56
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,770
reasons why videos often aren't used in

57
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,750
courtrooms simply because of the odds of

58
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,699
them getting thrown out and the intense

59
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,270
and dense information that they need to

60
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,269
include
