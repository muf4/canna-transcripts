1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,359
interested in learning more about adding

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,439
humic acid for

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,798
to your cannabis plants you've come to

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,759
the right place here at tobacco

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,679
university

6
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:17,920
where here we're going to discuss this

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:17,920
very topic

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,400
all right let's get into using humic

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,480
acid for cannabis production

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,320
so first off what is humic acid probably

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,879
should just in generally just define

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,879
that

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,000
uh humic and folic acids are the final

14
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,839
breakdown components

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
of decaying plants and animals found in

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,920
prehistoric deposits

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,640
one source of humic acids is the

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,480
sedimentation of layers found in

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,679
liardinite it's kind of this kind of

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,799
fine

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,119
powdered black granulated form

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,640
this organic matter has not reached the

23
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,000
state of coal but it kind of has some

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
properties or at least feels some of the

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
coal

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,920
and differs from soft brown coal by its

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,559
high

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,160
oxidation degree as in as a result the

29
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,399
process of coal formation

30
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,640
has no value as fuel so this is not

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
going to like burn like coal

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,439
but if you looked at it and didn't quite

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,359
know what it was it has some

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,519
similarities to like a very finely

35
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,560
granulated coal product

36
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,319
now we're looking at the research

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,478
article here where they looked at the

38
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,399
impact of nitrogen phosphate potassium

39
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,159
and humic acid supplementation

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
looking at the chemical profile of

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,680
medical cannabis and again i'm just

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,400
going to provide a brief overview here's

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,840
the link you can learn more about it

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,840
so humic acid and thc levels well for

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
example the following uh humic acid

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,118
applications

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,799
thc levels at the top of the plant was

48
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,599
reduced from 11.8

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,240
to 7.4 percent and consequently

50
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,798
concentrations throughout the plant

51
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,158
height did not differ significantly so

52
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
if we're looking to just get it to thc

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,719
the

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,799
top center and bottom portions of the

55
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,599
plant definitely seemed like there was a

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,040
reduction

57
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,640
which kind of seems a little odd here's

58
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,840
our commercial phosphorus potassium in

59
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,359
our humic acids

60
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,640
that there's an overall this reduction

61
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,319
from 11.8 to 7.8 percent thc levels

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,840
so a little bit concerning here if we're

63
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,118
looking at trying to maximize some

64
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,000
cannabinoids

65
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,919
i'll also see here with cbd and cbg some

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,318
of the differences that occurred

67
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,119
that's just a clear indication of what

68
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,839
occurred with just

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,680
thc levels again more data here if you

70
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,520
want to investigate or pause the video

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,000
right now so going on to the impact of

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,800
humic

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,318
acids well the nutrition treatments were

74
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,879
supplemented with umic acid

75
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,399
enhanced phosphorus fertilization or

76
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,280
enhanced nitrogen phosphorus and

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,200
potassium

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,519
hemetic acid was found to reduce the

79
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,318
natural variability of all of the

80
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
cannabinoids

81
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,518
studied so it's just kind of concerning

82
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,439
there

83
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,200
the results demonstrate sensitivity of

84
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,000
cannabinoid metabolism to mineral

85
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,518
nutrition

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,159
so you want to be mindful that adding

87
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,599
more inputs to your plants

88
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,120
may not get you always more return

89
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,639
now there's nutrients impact on the

90
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
cannabinoids

91
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,719
so phosphorus enhanced treatment

92
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
did not affect thc cbd cbgn or cbg

93
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,400
concentrations in the flowers

94
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,000
from the top of the plants a sixteen

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,599
percent reduction of thc

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,120
concentration was observed in

97
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,839
inflorescent leaves though

98
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,719
it's an important note the complete npk

99
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
supplementation

100
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,479
increased cbg levels in the flowers by

101
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,920
71 percent

102
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:22,719
and lowered cvn levels in both flowers

103
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,878
and inflorescent leaves by 38 and 36

104
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,158
respectively so this is also where it

105
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,598
comes important as growers

106
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,280
to understand what cannabinoids

107
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,598
specifically you're looking to produce

108
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,318
or

109
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,560
maximize because that can impact what

110
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,798
fertilizers or what treatments

111
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
you might give to your plants rather

112
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,120
than just trying to

113
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,879
try something i hope for better results

114
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,280
looking at targeting specific compounds

115
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,759
and how they are influenced by the

116
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,479
inputs that the grower utilizes you can

117
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,399
see here

118
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,598
has a great impact we don't want to do

119
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,760
anything that's going to increase

120
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,438
cost and time and labor that's going to

121
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,359
cause a reduction in yield

122
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,680
so be an informed grower do your

123
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,680
research and make educated decisions

124
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,680
on anything you choose to add
