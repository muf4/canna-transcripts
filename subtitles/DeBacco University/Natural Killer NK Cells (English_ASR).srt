1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
so here when investigate natural killer

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:07,798
cells or NK cells and how they relate to

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,480
the human immune system I can tell you

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,849
right now they are very appropriately

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,230
named related to the function that they

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:18,390
perform now natural killer cells they go

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,460
through and they're looking for infected

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,949
cells so we could see here in the first

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,630
case our natural killer cells recognize

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,310
an MHC class 1 major histone

11
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:31,018
complementary complex here and it

12
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,808
doesn't kill this cell it's able to

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:37,439
recognize these surface proteins as self

14
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:39,628
and a healthy cell as a result or

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,429
natural killer cell does not destroy

16
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:43,169
that cell this is because it's

17
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,030
recognized as self or host it's

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,390
displaying the right

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,950
identifying proteins on the outside

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,259
however in this case in the below here

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,809
we have an infected cell we notice the

22
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:58,049
proteins recognitions are not being

23
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,789
expressed as a result our natural killer

24
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,189
cell will go about lice in that cell

25
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,680
keep in mind till lice means to kill or

26
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:06,629
destroy or break up that cell so because

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,790
this one is infected with a virus it's

28
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:11,310
not displaying the proper recognition

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,960
proteins on the outside and a natural

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,320
killer cell will go through the process

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,569
of destroying that cell it's important

32
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,849
that our natural killer cells don't go

33
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,679
around destroying every cell only the

34
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:25,169
ones that are infected or need to be

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,350
eliminated and those are determined by

36
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,560
not displaying the proper coat proteins

37
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,899
on the outside the natural killer cells

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,310
can lice and kill cancer cells and virus

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,680
infected cells making them a very

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,780
important component of the immune system

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,820
they're the most aggressive of dooming

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,700
cells and they're the only phagocyte

43
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,559
that destroys other human cells they

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,299
react not specifically and eliminate

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,250
cancerous and virus infected cells they

46
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,579
kill their target cells by releasing

47
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,489
these toxin proteins here foreign

48
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,709
proteins and other cytolytic chemicals

49
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,468
they secrete these potent chemicals that

50
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:05,938
enhance the inflammatory response so

51
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:08,250
while these might sound like a bad thing

52
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,199
initially that creating inflammation in

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,360
certain instances particularly sites of

54
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,859
injury they are important and as a

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,140
result they go through

56
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,540
and they are able to go through the body

57
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,909
and kill target cells through these

58
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,079
through this process hopefully this is

59
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,199
giving you a little bit more background

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,850
and exactly what natural killer cells do

61
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,429
and how they're able to recognize

62
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:32,030
healthy cells from one that is a virus

63
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,030
infected
