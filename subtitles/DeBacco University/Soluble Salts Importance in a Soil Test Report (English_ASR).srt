00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,720
going to go over soluble salt's

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,290
importance

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,460
in a soil test report

5
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,460
[Music]

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,760
all right this image kind of shows some

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,320
negative impacts of high soluble salts

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
here

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,760
where this sidewalk has probably been

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,960
treated with some salt maybe in the

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
winter time and here it is the

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,160
springtime

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,359
we can see an area here where the grass

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
is not growing

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,880
this is an indication here that the

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,800
salts might be really high

17
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,079
preventing this grass from being able to

18
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,159
survive and grow

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,480
along the sidewalk edge so let's get

20
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,159
into soluble salt's importance in a soil

21
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,640
test report

22
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,238
so causes for elevated salt levels you

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
know what's going to cause this and we

24
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:46,000
saw

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
previously where it could be near a

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,878
walkway but let's look at this kind of

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,039
from

28
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,960
other aspects that could cause this well

29
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,719
soluble salt levels might be elevated in

30
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,640
areas close to roads where salt

31
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,719
compounds are used for de-icing

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,679
or excessive fertilizer has also been

33
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,359
applied

34
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,640
this can form in the form of traditional

35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,040
chemical fertilizer

36
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,920
but also organic amendments as well such

37
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,118
as manure

38
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,879
can also has elevated salt levels so in

39
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,040
some cases organic amendments may be

40
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,239
added at levels that increase soil salt

41
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,040
levels greater

42
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,118
than those using commercial fertilizer

43
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,080
this comes to a shock to a lot of people

44
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:23,599
everyone thinks that there's the

45
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,560
commercial fertilizer is what's causing

46
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,199
a lot of salts

47
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
but keep in mind natural manures can

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,000
also contain high levels of salt

49
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,200
and if excessively added can cause salt

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,239
levels to be higher

51
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,640
than those using commercial fertilizer

52
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,000
so elevated salt levels impact on plants

53
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
well high soluble salt levels

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,478
can cause severe water stress in

55
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,799
nutrient imbalances in plants

56
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,519
basically it's causing the water to

57
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,118
essentially

58
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,438
leave the root causing it to kind of

59
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,359
like dehydrate the plant

60
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,279
so want to keep in mind that we can see

61
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,718
here of control and increasing salt

62
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,879
levels there's a certain point

63
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,319
where plants can become stunted they can

64
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,319
become yellowed

65
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,639
that structure will be poor all these

66
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,319
can lead to reduced harvest in yields in

67
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
your plants

68
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,000
so salt levels uh what do the numbers

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
mean so if you do take a

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,199
soluble salt level what are we looking

71
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,719
at as far as numbers what are they kind

72
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,560
of translating to

73
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,400
well it's an electrical conductivity

74
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,640
that's typically um given you

75
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
you just see this mmh0 in over

76
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,598
centimeters

77
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,879
this is an electrical connectivity unit

78
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,598
that stands for

79
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,519
millimole per centimeter that

80
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,479
essentially measures total salts in

81
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,480
solution

82
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,359
now for talking for mineral soils low

83
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:38,399
saline is considered less than 0.4

84
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,400
slightly saline is 0.4 to 0.8

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
and this might cause some injury in salt

86
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,959
sensitive plants

87
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,199
moderate saline is 0.81 to 1.2

88
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
this will restrict growth of many plants

89
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,598
we see restrict growth reducing root

90
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,319
structure

91
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,318
therefore reducing top growth if you see

92
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,318
any numbers above 1.2

93
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,359
this will likely result in severe plant

94
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,439
damage

95
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
and levels can be reduced by repeated

96
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,120
rain water or

97
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,959
irrigation is known to be have low ec

98
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,640
levels so this does not mean it's

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,000
necessarily detrimental to the plants

100
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,518
forever

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,598
when you have to go through and dilute

102
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,920
those total salts or basically flush

103
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,000
them

104
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,919
out of the soil profile and that will

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,639
help them to go back to the normal

106
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,878
levels

107
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,719
assuming you catch this early and salt

108
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,799
levels aren't extremely high

109
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,878
and you don't have a very salt sensitive

110
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,000
crop so again keep this in mind

111
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,639
for my those using commercial fertilizer

112
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
as well as those which often forget this

113
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,359
using

114
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200
organic fertilizers as well your salt

115
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,400
levels become elevated

116
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,399
just as easily
