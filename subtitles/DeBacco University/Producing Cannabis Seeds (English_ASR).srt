1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,459
so while not often done producing

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,339
cannabis seeds so many times grossly

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,990
their purchase seeds are clones rather

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,210
than going through the [ __ ] producing

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,888
their own I just wanted to touch on what

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,960
it does take to produce cannabis seeds

7
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,809
so you make an informed decision whether

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,760
it's something want to pursue or not so

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,679
British in seeds is often not advised so

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,320
due to variability that seeds do produce

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,018
the time to select out males when we do

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,118
plant seeds the lack of cannabinoid

13
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,739
production within the square footage of

14
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,509
your gross space and chance of

15
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,609
pollinating females unintentionally

16
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:38,820
through pollen that may get caught up in

17
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:39,988
ventilation systems or nearby plants

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,128
here because you can see it's very very

19
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:47,369
fine and it does spread quite well even

20
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:49,259
though you may try to control it the

21
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,479
seed keep in mind the plant has to

22
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,140
invest energy to fully develop in the

23
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:57,959
seed because these do contain in embryo

24
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,030
this is a peach here but in embryo and

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,500
endosperm which is the energy storage

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,010
that's where a lot of the energy goes to

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,140
and a seed coat as a protective shell to

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,260
help protect that seed and again there's

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,709
a little simplified rendition of what a

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,859
cutaway

31
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,478
of a seed might look like now when

32
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,030
producing seeds it takes about six to

33
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,019
eight weeks to ripen those seeds and the

34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,670
way you can kind of tell when they are

35
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,259
ripening is when the seeds are rattle in

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,299
the pods they're fully mature and

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,609
harvest can occur just slightly before

38
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,380
this time but it's good to wait until

39
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:29,728
then I mean it'd be as pronounced as a

40
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,548
rattlesnake when you kind of get that

41
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:35,099
rattling kind of sound would be kind of

42
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,920
move the flower here that's a good time

43
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,219
to know that those seeds are probably

44
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,840
ripe enough and ready to be harvested

45
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:44,728
now if you don't wait long enough so

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,890
some girls try to shortcut the seed

47
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,719
production phase you harvest them too

48
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,519
early often the seed quality will be

49
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,519
poor and every dur reduced in

50
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,379
germination rates the reason for this is

51
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,039
that the endosperm may not be fully

52
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,658
developed

53
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,210
provide the embryo with enough energy to

54
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,210
start on before it's able to emerge from

55
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,859
the soil and start capturing sunlight so

56
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,750
just sound the quick picture here we

57
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,659
could see some of these seeds this one

58
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,469
this one one over here are not very

59
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:16,259
mature those darker seed coats and

60
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,689
your seeds will typically indicate a

61
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,759
fully mature seed it's had time to fully

62
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,379
develop its seed coat which indicates

63
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,659
that the endosperm is probably as

64
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,810
well-developed as could be and that will

65
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,789
increase the odds of germination some of

66
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,949
these that are lighter colorations or

67
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:34,530
even it's like green color typically

68
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:36,389
have very poor in germination rates so

69
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,099
you can use this also to kind of inspect

70
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,289
your seeds when you do go through and

71
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,759
harvest them to make sure that you're

72
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:43,919
selecting for the ones with the best

73
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,219
odds of germination and again it takes a

74
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,958
little time to wait so that is so just

75
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,120
so you're advised on what it takes to

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,469
produce cannabis seeds and typically

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,259
growers will commit to just seed

78
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:58,050
production and that try to grow on

79
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,609
pollinated flowers with seeds because of

80
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,500
the degree that the male pollen can

81
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,650
spread and could potentially cross

82
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,300
contaminate other areas or grow rooms

83
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,300
that people may have said
