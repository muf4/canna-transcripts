1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,110
okay have a little bit of a unique video

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,878
lecture here for you on angular

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,379
movements since we're talking about

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,050
movements it's kind of hard to show that

5
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:12,960
and static images so I have included

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,210
quite a few gifs here in this video

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,618
lecture love to hear your comments below

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,170
after watching it which we may have

9
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,929
liked or didn't like about this unique

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,100
lecture series so starting with just

11
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:25,320
some of the background we have our

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,820
angular movements what is that

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,649
well angular movements are produced by

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,439
changing the angle between bones of a

15
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,500
joint when we're bending occurring

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,329
that's when the angle between bones

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,308
decreases here's some of the categories

18
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,950
we're going to be looking at extenders

19
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:43,128
flexor abductors adductors so on and so

20
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,539
forth and here's the description

21
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:47,729
hopefully you find the gifs a little bit

22
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,989
more interesting and memorable to be

23
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:53,308
able to make connections between these

24
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:57,000
categories so flux on and extension so

25
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:59,640
this an occur in both the lower leg here

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,920
you can also occur in the head region so

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,710
if you look our individual here we have

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,049
the green extending and then flux out

29
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,089
and they're going back flex on the

30
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,640
extending on the green looking at the

31
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,920
blue leg you'll notice that when it's

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,170
going forward here we have the extension

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,740
and then the flux on the bend

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,060
here's a flux and here's the extension

35
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:23,069
looking at the green line there's that

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,680
flux on there that moving back flex on

37
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,809
and extension now in the head region the

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,570
same thing can occur extensions moving

39
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,640
backwards and a flux times going forward

40
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:34,228
so we see initially the initial values

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,859
of flux on the followed by the extension

42
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,179
going back hopefully that so it makes it

43
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,719
a little bit more helpful to remember

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,130
these two moving on we have rotation now

45
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,039
there's two different types of rotation

46
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:50,250
we have a lateral and a medial rotation

47
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,229
so joe joel mchale here who knows

48
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,899
initially that rotations a lateral

49
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:57,989
rotation followed by a medial rotation

50
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,649
there so the rotation of the head that

51
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:03,658
lateral followed by the medial there

52
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:08,009
returning to that midline so those are

53
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,979
two different types of rotation and then

54
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:13,469
video

55
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,120
abduction and adduction here so it's

56
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,449
important remember when we're going away

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,789
you think of opposing that would be a

58
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:22,318
deduction here you see our femur and

59
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:25,620
articulation of our ball and socket

60
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:28,769
joint our abduction is when it goes away

61
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,810
from the midline and then adduction here

62
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,980
as once as it's returning towards the

63
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:37,050
midline so abduction followed by

64
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:41,659
adduction turning that midline abduction

65
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:44,130
and then add duction return that anymore

66
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,409
elevation and depression looking here

67
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,120
particularly at the mandible so when the

68
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,159
mouths are open here on the simpsons

69
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,580
that's the depressed mandible or all

70
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:57,389
kind of hanging mouth open and and then

71
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,750
maggie helps homer there l the elevation

72
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:02,639
of his manual bringing it back up so

73
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:07,949
depression is down and elevation is

74
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:11,099
working its way back off there moving on

75
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:14,789
protrusion and retrieving so we see the

76
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:17,129
fish here initially we see that

77
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:19,169
protrusion as that jaw extends out and

78
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,689
be choosen as that mandible comes back

79
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:24,030
in here the woman at the lower points is

80
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:28,819
pushing her chin in in the recruiting

81
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,449
position of her mandible pronation and

82
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,959
supination

83
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:36,509
we see that here where we're rotating

84
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,840
our radius over the ulna via the

85
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:42,449
pronation you see that here with Justin

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,150
Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon you see that

87
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:46,409
rotation that is occurring here when

88
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,590
they're both in the parallel position

89
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,030
that would be the supination and when

90
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,849
it's rotated over that'd be called

91
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,629
pronation step remember supination that

92
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:59,310
parallel is considered the standard

93
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:01,590
orientation there also another video on

94
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,109
the forearm pronation and supination

95
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,120
there hopefully you found this lecture a

96
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,719
little bit unique interesting and

97
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,719
memorable
