00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,318
this debaco university video is going to

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,000
go over how to set up a mechanical timer

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,759
for your lights now it's important to

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,759
plug your lights into the wall initially

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,599
to test them but then you want to go

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,359
through once you know they're working as

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,199
we're going to see here in our student

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,800
series with kiara she's going to go over

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,198
how to properly set up a mechanical

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,359
timer so you can ensure your plants will

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,359
be exposed to the right photo period

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,359
enjoy

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,238
[Music]

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,759
so now that we know that the lights work

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,279
we don't want them just plugged into the

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,439
wall anymore because we need them to be

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,920
able to turn on and off by themselves so

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,079
that's why we invest in a timer for our

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,120
plants

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,039
this adjusts the light based on the time

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,199
that you set for it so if you wanted to

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,439
it could be for 12 hours 18 hours six

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,239
hours adjustable for whatever your grow

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,479
is

25
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,159
so the first step of setting up a timer

26
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,878
is to align it to the time that it is

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,238
right now so i'm going to set it

28
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,399
to

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,000
4 20 p.m

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,519
so right about there

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,599
next you're going to want to decide how

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,040
long you want your lights on for so

33
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,679
depending on

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,000
how many of these you push down is how

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,479
long the timer is going to be on for so

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,719
i want it to be on for 18 hours of

37
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,719
flight so for going from 420

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,320
right around 11 20

39
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,438
is where i wanted to end then we have

40
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,559
our one two three four five six hours of

41
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,399
night time

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,400
as you can see here

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,200
the switch can tell

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,240
where

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,159
it the time of day is based on the timer

46
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,679
so go around and see that it's night

47
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,799
time well night time for the plants

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,200
lights off

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,840
and then turn back on

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,799
and click once it gets back to the

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,799
turned on section of the light

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,759
and then again once it goes to the end

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,759
it clicks off

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
then to make sure that all of your

55
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,640
effort was accounted for you're going to

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,000
want to make sure that it's set for

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,000
timer and not just indefinite
