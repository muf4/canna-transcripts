1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,889
here we're a look at a very short and

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:08,130
brief overview of lipids as you can see

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:10,888
in the image here lipids are a form of

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,490
basically fats is how we may associate

5
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:16,198
with this type of macromolecule so the

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,210
street forms of lipids fats is one of

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,230
them which may be the focus here there's

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,600
also going to be a video on

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,420
phospholipids and steroids if you want

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,340
to check that out on the channel here so

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,010
looking specifically at fats as one of

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,809
the forms of lipids again typically

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,669
lipids and fats can sometimes be

14
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,009
considered an exchangeable terms but

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,529
lipids is the correct broad macro

16
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,579
molecule fats are used for long-term

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,829
energy storage usually use the term

18
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,920
triglycerides which as we see here which

19
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,710
means they have 3 3 fatty acids with a

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,960
Cristal bat though the composed of these

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,460
fatty acid chains and are linked

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,259
together so these are not independent

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,789
fatty acids so it looks like they're

24
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,030
kind of separate here they would be

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,670
linked to this literal backbone and this

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,070
is our definition of fats and then being

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,400
insoluble in water means that the

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:11,639
hydrophobic in nature so this is just a

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,570
very brief overview of lipids and as I

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,219
said if you're interested in

31
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:17,419
phospholipids or steroids there'll be

32
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,420
separate videos on those
