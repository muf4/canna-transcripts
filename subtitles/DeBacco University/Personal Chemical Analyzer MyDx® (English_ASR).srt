1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,329
okay I'm going to provide some

2
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:06,960
information about a personal chemical

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,519
analyzer called my DX and provided links

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,240
down here I'm not sponsored by this

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,638
company

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,500
I know growers used it and it's but when

7
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:15,779
very highly of it I want to convey some

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,028
information so that you're aware of its

9
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,730
existence and also what it does and why

10
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:22,439
it's been gaining popularity so first

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,899
off my DX is the first of its kind

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,820
portable chemical analyzer allowing you

13
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,070
to affordably and accurately identify

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,510
the composition of your chandus and

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,509
that's a quote directly from the company

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,100
it's a small device kind of the size of

17
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:41,519
a wallet here and it has it can produce

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,800
some very interesting results so the

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,570
goal of my VX is to provide growers and

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,909
medical patients with an easy-to-use

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,340
handheld tool to test their cannabis

22
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,468
plant material so this is the advantage

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,570
that it gives is that yes you can send

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,879
it off to a lab this is kind of that

25
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,128
quick easy way to tell it takes a very

26
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,799
small sample here and it goes into the

27
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,899
device right in this little tray here

28
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,569
and again bottom this contains links

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,310
more information so this handheld

30
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:12,929
chemical analyzer you can see how it's

31
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,760
not about large size at least in kind of

32
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,729
lengthen with the size of typical

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,189
smartphone it's links via a Bluetooth

34
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:21,359
device so you need there's mic shown in

35
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:23,639
relation to a smart phone and there's a

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,650
Bluetooth connection between those to

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,228
allow for easy acquisition and transfer

38
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,700
of the data so well perform the test it

39
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:31,739
itself doesn't have any readouts

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,049
directly on the unit it needs to

41
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:38,069
communicate with a device here via

42
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,229
bluetooth so it works of by a sample of

43
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,149
cannabis and then providing an

44
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:44,429
easy-to-read analysis for various things

45
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,920
this is just one example again pulled

46
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,420
right from their website cannabinoid

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,329
test for THC CBD CBN th T V a kind of

48
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,099
profile also of terpenes and again this

49
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:57,959
is an example here at you can see and it

50
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,509
kind of gives this nice coloration so

51
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:03,089
you'll be able to compare different

52
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:04,649
varieties easily and quickly now there's

53
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,390
also a crowd source or data to make

54
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,640
connections between personal effects

55
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,259
noticed for medical patients that's it

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,119
you know for pain for stress depression

57
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,589
on they're kind of populating

58
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,300
information there

59
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,060
based on what you feel and putting that

60
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,870
into a set there then it can be accessed

61
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,550
through the mydx app so again I'm not

62
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,650
sponsored by the company here but

63
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,300
personal kendall analyzed are called my

64
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,719
DX might be worth checking out

65
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,569
especially to make sure varieties that

66
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,629
you may be getting or testing very low

67
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:39,919
in THC and high in the medically benefit

68
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:39,919
of CBD
