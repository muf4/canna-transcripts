1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
if you're looking for a professional way

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,160
to store your cannabis buds the use of

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,200
nitrogen gas can be a great way to go

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,359
about this

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:17,920
in here on debaco university we're going

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:17,920
to cover just that

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,320
all right let's get into the use of

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,679
nitrogen gas for storing cannabis buds

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,518
well first off the obvious question

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,480
should be well why use nitrogen it's

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,479
already 78

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320
in the atmosphere it's a colors or

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,519
odorless gas and heavier than oxygen why

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,119
would you utilize that

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,039
well nitrogen has actually been used for

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,119
years in preservation of perishables

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,159
during transport and storage probably

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,679
most notable

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,439
for the meat industry it's why things

20
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,119
come in nice sealed containers

21
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,039
these containers will be sealed and

22
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,558
nitrogen gas will be added

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,800
to that environment to help preserve

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,799
that meat as long as possible

25
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,919
so the nitrogen advantage so we're

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,759
looking at nitrogen the

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,600
gas flush sealed mylar bags are

28
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,320
excellent packaging for long-term

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920
storage

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,000
the process flushes the bag with

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,879
nitrogen and then seals it

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,920
purging packages of oxygen extends the

33
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,438
life of the buds

34
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,079
and prevents growth of mold and

35
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,959
discoloration similar to that of vacuum

36
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,000
sealing some testing labs offer nitrogen

37
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,000
bagging services

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,599
using tamper-proof packaging so that's

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,159
another advantage

40
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,000
so this nitrogen sealing technology are

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,600
really great for that really long-term

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,599
storage and preservation

43
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,559
of maintaining that high quality over an

44
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,280
extended period of time nitrogen is

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,879
being used so you've probably

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,320
had a bag of potato chips and actually

47
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,519
it's been sealed with nitrogen

48
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,438
potato chips are shipped in

49
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,719
nitrogen-filled bags that not only help

50
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,399
with the preservation

51
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,759
but limit damage during shipping and

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,359
transport if you try to

53
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,959
push on a potato chip bag there's a lot

54
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,519
of air in it well that

55
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,359
air is usually higher percentage

56
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,078
nitrogen than the normal atmospheric

57
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,840
conditions

58
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,599
that helps keep all the chips from

59
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
breaking and helps keep

60
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,879
long-term storage because that nitrogen

61
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,118
has helped with that and the same

62
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,599
concept can be applied to your cannabis

63
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,078
buds

64
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,679
prevent the physical damage of the buds

65
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,478
as well as preserving the long-term

66
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,719
storage

67
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,679
by the use of higher concentrations of

68
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,399
nitrogen

69
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,560
in this storage environment so that

70
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,560
nitrogen saturation advantage

71
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,719
well sealing up containers with nitrogen

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,719
gas can reduce the oxidation

73
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,159
and help preserve the cannabinoids as

74
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,639
well as the terpenes

75
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,120
so it's limiting that kind of breaking

76
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,598
down process now as we saw it could be

77
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,000
in

78
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,119
mylar bags could also be in kind of what

79
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,598
looks like a

80
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,239
cat food or tuna fish container here as

81
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,839
well

82
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,599
this aluminum can both can have nitrogen

83
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,159
saturation applied to them doesn't have

84
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,679
to be just

85
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,639
one set system there is however added

86
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,040
cost to this

87
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,919
so there is at cost with this nitrogen

88
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,039
gas option

89
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,518
but consumers may not see a great value

90
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,120
with this unlike the quality curing and

91
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,560
trimming of buds that they will notice

92
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,039
and may be willing to pay a little bit

93
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,199
more

94
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,479
for while this is advised the use of

95
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,560
nitrogen gas it should

96
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,878
incorporate only high quality end

97
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,280
product to ensure only the best material

98
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,280
has the longest shelf life and something

99
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,400
you're going to hopefully get a near top

100
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,080
dollar for and keep in mind that use of

101
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,719
nitrogen gas don't forget about the

102
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,319
light

103
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,239
storing canvas and nitrogen does have

104
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,079
its advantages as presented here

105
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,400
but light can still degrade the blood

106
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,680
quality even if nitrogen is used

107
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
so don't think just because you're using

108
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,879
this nitrogen gas saturation that

109
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,479
now you can keep them all out in the

110
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,919
light and they won't be affected they

111
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,598
still can be broken down by other

112
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,719
environmental factors but utilizing the

113
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,639
nitrogen gas

114
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,560
can help preserve the local environment

115
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,238
those buds are kept for the longest

116
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
storage option so you're able to

117
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,519
maintain that high quality

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,519
for as long as possible
