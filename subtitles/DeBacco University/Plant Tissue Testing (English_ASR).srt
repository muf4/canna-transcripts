1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
okay you were just gonna look at a brief

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,298
overview of plant tissue testing and how

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,580
it kind of relates to cannabis so when

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,460
we're looking at you know deltal paying

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,129
an idea of the nutrients we can test the

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,230
soil or the soilless media you can also

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,940
test the actual plant material that's

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,420
what this is about the actual tissue on

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,760
the plant so when you are tissue testing

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,160
there's important points of know one is

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,529
where you sample is important maybe

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,868
having at the top sampling at the side

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:33,570
branch is having a lower branch that can

14
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:36,630
play a role in the nutrients in that

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,609
particular plant also the stage of that

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,950
plant in its development plays a role in

17
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:44,579
the nutrients so if a sampling from a

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,200
younger plant versus an older plant that

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,270
can influence where you want to take

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,469
that sample for the ideal or best

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,329
consistent results now the advantage of

22
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,670
tissue testing you all know what's

23
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,230
actually inside the plant inside the

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,719
actual tissue this could provide a

25
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:02,279
comparison from the soil to get a better

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,710
understanding of the differences that

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,840
may be occurring so is a nutrient high

28
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,279
in the soil but low in the plant or

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,049
something really high in the plant that

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,579
may not be in the soil this can help

31
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,189
give you a better picture a more

32
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,950
holistic approach of not only the soil

33
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,750
but also how the plant is reacting to

34
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,430
the nutrients you may be feeding for the

35
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,250
new students that may be present or

36
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,350
absent in this soil profile or even the

37
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,578
soilless media now kind of the

38
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:31,828
challenges and this is ridiculous

39
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,048
is that having a standard to compare to

40
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:36,269
there's a lot of other tissue testing we

41
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,280
take corn and tomatoes while there's a

42
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:41,280
lot of testing to compare to it can be a

43
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,950
little bit hard for canvas also sending

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,079
the physical samples and finding a lab

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,450
that will them to take the samples can

46
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,399
sometimes be a challenge shipping them

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,219
in the mail there's some potential

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,659
issues with that and also certain labs

49
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,640
simply just do not want to deal with

50
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,810
cannabis samples so you might feel a

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,689
call the lab ahead of time before

52
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,790
sending anything and figure out a way

53
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:06,209
that may work because tissue testing can

54
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,920
offer a valuable tool to evaluate the

55
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,919
nutrients inside your plan
