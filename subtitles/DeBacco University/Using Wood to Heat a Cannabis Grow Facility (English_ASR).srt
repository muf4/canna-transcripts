1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,960
so wood is a common heat source but here

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,119
at tobacco university we're going to

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:16,160
look at using wood to heat a cannabis

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:17,760
grow facility

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,600
so if you want to use wood to heat your

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,600
grow facility let's go over some of the

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,960
details with that and considerations you

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,679
should be making

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,679
so first off wood heat just in general

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,399
wood is relatively inexpensive

11
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,879
as forest residue no waste chips or even

12
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,759
as

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,960
sawdust often the cost is driven more by

14
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,679
the transportation

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,799
in handling than the actual product this

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,119
could be dependent on

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,640
location as well a lot of times people

18
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,718
are using wood heat to eat their houses

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,480
so it is again a very common form of

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,480
heat source

21
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,640
wood versus oil so looking at kind of

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,599
the comparison between the two here

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,719
fuel oil requirement for about 20 000

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
square feet

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,079
of greenhouse space located in

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,558
connecticut would be about 20

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,439
000 gallons for the heating season if

28
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,599
wood is

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,759
substituted as a fuel source this would

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,719
require a hundred and approximately

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,280
110 cords of hardwood this means that

32
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,079
handling about 220 tons

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,320
if the furnace was fired by hand so

34
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,239
that's again an important consideration

35
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,000
when we're looking at how we're going to

36
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,438
be utilizing the wood

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,438
there's going to be a manual loading

38
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,879
type the cost of the wood is only six

39
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,319
thousand dollars delivered

40
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,560
in log length compared to the 35 000

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,639
for the estimated oil cost now keep in

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,159
mind that log length is not nice chopped

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,159
up and kind of ready to go

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,079
as the picture shows above me the

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
difference is enough to have reasonable

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,679
payback for the equipment

47
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,438
and to pay for what's called a night

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,000
fireman somebody has to constantly

49
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,919
feed that fire and keep it going for the

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,959
duration of the night when it is the

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,719
coldest

52
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,078
so again all these have to be taken into

53
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,679
consideration

54
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,599
however when we're looking at wood we

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
also want to be considerate of the

56
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,438
moisture content furnaces and boilers

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,040
that burn

58
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,199
cord wood or chips and sawdust are

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,520
available the heat value of the fuel

60
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,920
depends on the moisture content

61
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,560
so for example green hold tree chips

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,439
have a heat

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
value of about 8 million btus per ton

64
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,878
dried

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,239
chips have a heat value of 14 million

66
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,799
btus per ton

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,439
so that re reduction in moisture content

68
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
really

69
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,039
increases the btus or the british

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,439
thermal units

71
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,199
of that wood that it can provide if the

72
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,439
wood is burned at high temperatures more

73
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,679
than 1500 degrees fahrenheit

74
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,199
very little smoke or pollution occurs

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,719
that's another important consideration

76
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,479
if you get that heat high enough

77
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,479
you can have a very clean burning with

78
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,318
your wood again that wood could be

79
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,759
relatively low cost but there are going

80
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,919
to be that associated

81
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,159
night firemen at manual feeding that low

82
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,518
moisture content taken consideration

83
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:52,639
as well as the having enough supply

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,239
for your area depending on how cold

85
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,238
that season may be
