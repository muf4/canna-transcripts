1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
if you've looked at different storage

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,838
options for cannabis buds particularly

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,640
long-term storage and considered vacuum

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,800
sealing

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,080
this debaco university video is for you

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:17,920
because we're going to cover

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,920
vacuum sealing for storing cannabis buds

8
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:22,559
[Music]

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,240
all right as the image shows here let's

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,759
get into vacuum sealing for storing

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,598
cannabis buds

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,039
so first off this is a good long-term

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
storage option

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,039
of six plus months is what we're talking

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,159
when we're talking long term storage

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,558
times even a year

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,199
later with this method there can be no

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,199
noticeable

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
reduction in potency which is great if

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,559
you put all that work into

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,920
growing a quality product drying it

22
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:44,799
curing it you want to make sure you have

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,920
a nice good

24
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,919
long term storage option so vacuum

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
sealers are also very cost effective so

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,960
that's another advantage is that the

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,879
actual equipment needed

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,079
is not all that expensive and can be

29
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,718
used in both large

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,039
as well as small scale environments also

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,520
applies to more than just cannabis buds

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,359
it can be used for other food items as

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,079
well it's why they're so common

34
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,840
which is a great option to have however

35
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,000
you do want to avoid the vacuum sealing

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
bags themselves for cannabis because as

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,519
you can see in both of these image while

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,960
it does seal the buds very well

39
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,640
the environment created by the bags and

40
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,239
jars is essentially the same

41
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
there will be physical damage if you use

42
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,759
the bags basically it's crushing

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,520
the structure of those buds however this

44
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,000
will not impact the chemical profiles

45
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,399
that's a good

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
thing use vacuum sealing jars for

47
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,640
cannabis is advised to preserve the

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,118
contents

49
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,960
as well as the physical structure of

50
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,159
those contents

51
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,000
and this is what i'm talking about on

52
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,320
jars you could use either true vacuum

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,319
sealing jars or sealable jars

54
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,000
that then you put into a bag and seal it

55
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,719
that way a lot of growers prefer the

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,879
bags

57
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,319
they're less expensive they store easier

58
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,759
they may have a chosen jar but it may

59
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,398
not seal quite perfectly

60
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,840
vacuum sealing it will be a great option

61
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,640
because the physical structure will be

62
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,399
preserved because

63
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,399
the buds are protected in the jar but

64
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,000
this may also increase the total storage

65
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
area that's required so just keep that

66
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,759
in mind that now probably can't stack

67
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,240
these jars as well as you could have

68
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,680
when they're just their jars themselves

69
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,758
small containers are great to ensure

70
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,120
only small portions are being exposed to

71
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,878
the air and degradation

72
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,719
which will help ensure most of the

73
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,359
harvest will be kept in the ideal

74
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,199
environment

75
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
so you want to vacuum seal large giant

76
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,839
containers

77
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,760
because once you break that seal and

78
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
open it up you'll be exposing more buds

79
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,759
to the outside environment keep the jars

80
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,400
small kind of what you'll use in a short

81
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,318
period of time it can be a great way to

82
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
ensure that the overall total harvest is

83
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,159
preserved very well

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,759
mason jars jars in general great option

85
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,560
throw in a vacuum steel bag that way you

86
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,159
know

87
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,318
is definitely isolated from the outdoor

88
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,719
environment to keep your buds

89
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,399
for a very long term which is the goal

90
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,560
here to preserve that harvest

91
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,719
so you can enjoy it well after the

92
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,719
initial point of plant takedown
