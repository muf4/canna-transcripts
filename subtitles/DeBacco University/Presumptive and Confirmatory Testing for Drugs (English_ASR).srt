00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,759
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,480
video here we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,719
presumptive

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,000
and confirmatory testing for drugs

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,599
presumptive tests are the ones that are

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,279
going to be used initially on site

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,120
confirmatory is going to identify the

8
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,839
specific substance and typically

9
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,960
performed

10
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,160
in a lab setting so initially those

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,000
presumptive testing

12
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,079
as i said typically initiated by law

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,679
enforcement or those first on the scene

14
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,079
and they indicate if the suspected

15
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,358
substance is present or not present

16
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,278
test kit will typically produce a

17
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,760
positive indicating color if the

18
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,479
substance is present we see right next

19
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
to me here

20
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,199
a testing reagent for ecstasy then

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,200
laboratory testing that confirms with

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
certainty the presence of the suspected

23
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,719
substance

24
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,480
would be performed later and just as a

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,079
side note that presumptive testing can

26
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,640
also be performed at a laboratory

27
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,399
setting

28
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
as part of the analysis process to at

29
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,558
least determine or justify

30
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,198
what further tests should be carried out

31
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:54,558
and here we're looking at the

32
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,439
presumptive test for the

33
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,000
dukinoi reagent now the duke noise

34
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,960
reagent

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,159
is a positive test or we'll be testing

36
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,760
samples of

37
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,920
suspected marijuana or a thc

38
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,280
the duke noise test is conducted by

39
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,280
placing a small sample

40
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,879
of the suspected material about the size

41
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
of the tip of a typical pocket knife to

42
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,079
give you an idea

43
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,600
inside a test vial as we see here in the

44
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,079
image above me

45
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,280
the deep blue purple tint of the liquid

46
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,599
indicates

47
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
inside the vial indicates the test was

48
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,798
positive

49
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,599
for the cannabinoids present in the

50
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,680
sample

51
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,679
other thc containing drugs such as

52
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
marijuana hash oil

53
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,118
and others will produce a light blue to

54
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,599
dark purple reaction

55
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,319
using the duke noise reagent test so

56
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,839
again this is just

57
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,599
one example of a presumptive test

58
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,920
now this confirmatory test that i was

59
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,478
mentioning earlier confirmatory tests

60
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,600
use instrumental analysis to positively

61
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,759
identify the con

62
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,438
the contents of submitted material

63
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,000
typically it's a multi-step process to

64
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,559
separate out

65
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,920
individual components and compounds the

66
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,519
process determines the chemical

67
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,159
characteristics of the compounds to be

68
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,239
compared

69
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,159
to reference materials the goal is to

70
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,959
make a positive identification

71
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,399
in this qualitative analysis and helps

72
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,719
determine what substances

73
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,400
are present and if one or more of those

74
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,159
substances is illegal

75
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,239
the reason why this is typically done at

76
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,479
a laboratory settings because it has a

77
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,759
high degree of

78
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,039
specificity so we want to be sure we're

79
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,439
being very clean

80
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,479
very sterile and isolating we're getting

81
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,919
to identify the actual chemical profiles

82
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,439
versus a presumptive test or kind of

83
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,639
like an up down positive negative a

84
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,959
general idea

85
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,759
and then we'd identify those specific

86
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,920
substances

87
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,199
with this confirmatory test performed in

88
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,199
a laboratory setting
