00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,759
going to look at the threat of some

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,919
grower errors to cannabis plants since

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,839
we've all made mistakes when growing

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,199
here's going to be some helpful tips to

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,759
help you try to avoid some of those

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,919
common

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,920
grower errors

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,240
now as we can see here these plants

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,679
definitely look a little stressed

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,679
could be excessive nutrients could be

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,759
improper ph but we're going to go over

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,239
the threat of grower errors to canvas

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,599
plants

16
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,280
so hopefully you don't make some of

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,960
these same errors

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,719
so first off realize that when you're

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,160
growing plants errors will be made as

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,759
growers errors will be made but

21
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,199
identifying them and limiting the

22
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,759
negative impacts they have

23
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,359
are important know your own errors

24
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,799
own your own errors if you will and

25
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,558
realize them own up to them

26
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,479
and then make adjustments from there

27
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,198
documentation is important to be able to

28
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,799
recognize an

29
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,719
error that may have been made a while

30
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,558
back that takes a little time to show up

31
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,600
in certain plants some are not immediate

32
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,558
some take time

33
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,039
and it's important to have that

34
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,118
documentation

35
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,040
you also want to be writing down your

36
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,319
dilution rates so as growers

37
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
typically use a lot of different

38
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,559
products that's nothing wrong with that

39
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,478
but have an area where dilution rates

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,879
are written down as a reference so you

41
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,799
can ensure you do not work from memory

42
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,798
also be sure to actually measure and

43
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,240
estimate the amount that's being added

44
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,880
and you can write it right on the bottle

45
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,879
have a set chart have a set paper you

46
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,039
always go to so you're not just going

47
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,519
off of memory

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
also check the ph in concentration of

49
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,200
anything that you're adding

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
to ensure any unnecessary plant stress

51
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
is added

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,159
be sure to check your solution to avoid

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,719
something being applied that is outside

54
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,359
of the expected range these blue

55
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,599
guardian

56
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,118
monitors if you temperatures the ph

57
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,519
values the concentrations

58
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,399
also just a quick little pen here to go

59
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,879
through and check

60
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,640
can be a great way to ensure that you're

61
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,359
not going to give the plants any sort of

62
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,879
stresses

63
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,200
this is particularly important at the

64
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,959
very early stage or propagation stage

65
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,280
as plants are very susceptible to very

66
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,199
high doses of fertilizer can cause burn

67
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
or crinkling of leaves so be extra

68
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,239
mindful during that phase

69
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,840
to ensure you're not giving them

70
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,039
something that's way out the range of

71
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,120
the accepted ph

72
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,479
or concentration range to reduce the

73
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
chance of you inducing

74
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:21,199
any errors and negative impacts on your

75
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,199
tender cannabis plants
