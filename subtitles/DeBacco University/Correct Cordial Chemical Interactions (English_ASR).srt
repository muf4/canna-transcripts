1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
okay here I'm gonna go over the correct

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,390
cordial chemical interactions sorry I

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,780
can come up with another hard seat here

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:13,830
but this is leaving the chemical safety

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:15,329
for you in general so step one protect

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,048
yourself personal protection is

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,910
important

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:19,108
most the time goggles are required but

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,539
depending on what you're working with

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,779
gloves may also be needed lab coats are

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,250
advised that was working continually

12
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:28,679
within the lab to limit exposure to

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,509
chemicals again can be we were dealing

14
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,159
with serious cases you can see here we

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,070
have the PPE personal protection

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,529
equipment completely sealed sometimes

17
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,179
you'll see sign is using these lab coats

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,620
gloves are required

19
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,140
depayne what you're working with they

20
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,669
don't seem too happy in general but

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,739
depending again what you're working with

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,629
will dictate what you need to wear and

23
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:52,558
those would be covered with you in the

24
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:54,839
lab also know that'll on the hazmat

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,339
diamond can be advantageous its intend

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,859
to find a quick universal labeling of

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,750
materials now you may see this on other

28
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,149
places is you're traveling around this

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,920
kind of diamond-shaped key take-home

30
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,320
message I mean after them all the

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,170
details of it these four colorations

32
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,399
four if you see any fours that's reason

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,859
for concern because they're health

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,930
hazard and be deadly flash points would

35
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,989
be very low in radioactivity or

36
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,290
reactivity be very high here so we're

37
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:24,149
looking at again different ways we can

38
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,770
easily look at any chemical and have a

39
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,228
general idea what might be in their

40
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:31,679
areas that natural gas also have this

41
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:33,658
because it's potential explosives and it

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,400
is hazardous the white area may have

43
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,368
nothing in it or it may have these

44
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,969
various markers to help identify what

45
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:44,250
might be in there so again just a quick

46
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,438
reference point universally accepted and

47
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,090
gives you just a good idea of what's

48
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:52,349
what's in that particular storage area

49
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,780
now the chemical the SPS or the safety

50
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,578
sheet safety data sheet it should say

51
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,349
these can be found for any chemical

52
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,019
substance including everyday items so

53
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:03,478
you can look up just about anything on

54
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:05,578
the internet look for SDS sheets and

55
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,950
you're able to find first-aid recommend

56
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,179
for it firefighting accidental release

57
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,270
the healing and the storage of that

58
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,989
offer just about any product that you do

59
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,579
by

60
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,590
label containers that you use of this

61
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:19,120
prize to being in lab when you're using

62
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,819
chemicals in the lab be sure to label

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,469
containers to avoid confusion

64
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:26,318
just simple marker you put a piece of

65
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:28,479
tape and label it I want to be clear

66
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,339
whether it's poisonous or concerning or

67
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,949
if it's food items so just having an

68
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,209
idea because clear liquids look like

69
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:36,369
water and a lot of people assume it's

70
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,560
water it could be a whole host of things

71
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,719
or what could be dissolved in that water

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,878
could clearly make it fall into one

73
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,219
category or another so it's important to

74
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,429
label that to avoid confusion and also

75
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:51,459
to avoid mistakes made in the lab for

76
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,980
you and the grounds around you know the

77
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,900
proper method of disposal so for each

78
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:58,298
chemical and resulting mixtures know how

79
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,310
to properly dispose of it the solid

80
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:02,920
waste organic solvents all these would

81
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,408
be clearly states beginning of lab I

82
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,479
stress here the chemical and also the

83
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:09,908
resulting mixtures sometimes you can

84
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:12,068
have too benign chemicals chemicals that

85
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:13,870
you know are pretty much unreactive when

86
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:15,938
you mix them that can create a substance

87
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,129
that needs to be disposed of in a proper

88
00:03:15,938 --> 00:03:20,049
manner in the other way you can have two

89
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:22,048
sometimes more dangerous chemicals and

90
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:24,819
mix them together and develop a

91
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,430
substance that is not as harmful so just

92
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:29,018
know how to dispose of it so you're able

93
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,870
to put that in the right area you're not

94
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,689
causing potential contamination of not

95
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,750
only the experiment but groundwater or

96
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:39,009
the sewer system

97
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,759
when in doubt lastly when in doubt just

98
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:45,459
ask reader here and ask question look it

99
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:47,978
up asked a teacher so always good to

100
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:50,319
when you're in doubt just ask the

101
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:52,900
question and be able to direct you in

102
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,668
the right way to avoid any potential mix

103
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,000
health or hazards to you or those around

104
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,000
you
