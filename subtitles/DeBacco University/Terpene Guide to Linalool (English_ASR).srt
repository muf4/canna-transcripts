4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:17,439
little bit more information about this

so first off where is it located it's

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,079
sent in its basic

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,000
properties well as a floral uh terpene

10
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,439
and used in many perfumes it's something

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,278
you might be familiar with

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,200
that's found in a whole host of

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,399
different foods such as cinnamon celery

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
lavender

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,960
rosewood sweet basil and thyme as well

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,800
lanalu is commonly found in lavender

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
and its aroma is light and floral and

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,039
that's why you might be familiar with

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,119
this particular

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,479
scent it does differ from other terpenes

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,439
commonly found in cannabis and then it

22
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,839
has an o-h

23
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,920
or hydroxyl group attached to it making

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,120
it a terpene alcohol so it kind of

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
might change some of the various

26
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,479
properties when you're looking at

27
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,038
combining it with different things

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,640
now the medical benefits of lanaolu is

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,920
that it has been shown to be helpful in

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,960

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,118
as anxiety lanalo may even be used as a

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,920
sedative sleep aid

34
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,719
as well as in anti-conversant so kind of

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,799
an

36
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,760
interesting kind of properties here for

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,479
this particular

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,560
terpene some studies even have reported

39
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,039
the anti-inflammatory effects

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,320
of this essential oil and it is found in

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,479
other things other than just

42
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,679
cannabis it's widely known for the

43
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,359
ability to reduce stress

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
and it's used as an anti-anxiety

45
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,840
antidepressant and also a sedative

46
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,438
lonely is also used to relieve seizure

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
symptoms provide relief from those

48
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,719
suffering from psychosis

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
has a relaxing effect it can help you

50
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,719
sleep better so a lot of

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,239
great benefits with this particular

52
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,280
terpene if you're looking at potentially

53
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,798
where to find it

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
well this kind of gives you a general

55
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,280
idea of some strains

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
that might have this terpene in a little

57
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,879
bit higher concentration

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,719
however cannabis strains with purple

59
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,798
leaves and flowers tend to have higher

60
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,640
concentrations of this lanalo

61
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,640
however the specific phenotype of each

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,879
plant will be have different levels

63
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,040
of this terpene that are actually

64
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,399
present always good to get a test done

65
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,360
now the reason why i stress the purple

66
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,038
leaves anthocyanins is another kind of

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
plant pigment that's produced and we

68
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,479
notice a lot of purple coloration

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,560
associated with this particular terpene

70
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,840
so that is just a slight indication that

71
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,680
if you're seeing something

72
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,439
that has higher anthocyanin production a

73
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,080
little more of purple leaves there's a

74
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,479
chance

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
or maybe odds that it will also have a

76
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,079
higher concentration of

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,759
linalool best of luck if you're looking

78
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,760
for this particular terpene
