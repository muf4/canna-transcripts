1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,068
okay here we are cat comparing an

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,240
inference and observation so if you

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:08,309
think they're interchangeable terms

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,559
they're not we're going to learn what

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,509
defines each we're going to come back to

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,678
this image in a second we're going to

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,440
make some inferences and some

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,368
observations based on this image so

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,800
starting first you should probably

10
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,778
explain what each is well the

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,789
observation is limited to a description

12
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,768
of actions or events without

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,470
interpretation the key part there's

14
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,299
without interpretation in contrast to

15
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:33,058
that inference is a conclusion we draw

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,558
based on what we observe so you may be

17
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,019
asked is something an inference or an

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,539
observation well that quick kind of also

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,070
comparison between the two looking at an

20
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,378
inference to start with it's a

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,929
conclusion reached as based on evidence

22
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:49,049
and reasoning it involves a mental

23
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,299
process and a logical interpretation of

24
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,669
observations it can be based on

25
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,899
secondhand experiences and what it

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,309
really wouldn't infants really comes

27
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,239
down is so what you think about from an

28
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:02,759
observation

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,128
so then observations that description

30
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,719
without interpretation it involves

31
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,060
paying close attention and gaining

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,819
information it can use the five senses

33
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,950
it aids in the ability to generate an

34
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:18,298
inference it can be experienced

35
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:22,079
firsthand things you can kind of see and

36
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,368
observe no interpretation so let's go

37
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,039
back to that first image and make some

38
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:29,728
inferences and some observations so if

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,430
you look at this here observation we see

40
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:34,109
women getting splashed now an inference

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,450
would be it's a hot day into getting

42
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,659
splashed with water but we don't know if

43
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,140
this is just regular water this is lemon

44
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,609
water

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,590
this is iced water we are only inferring

46
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:48,629
something there again based on the

47
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,450
observations see she's wearing glasses

48
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:55,469
you can splash it in the face here you

49
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,379
can see how we can infer a lot and have

50
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,450
very limited observations but if we

51
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,589
threw a couple more examples here so

52
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,320
there's again our definitions between

53
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,990
observations and inference so we see

54
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,840
some footprints here in the sand well an

55
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:12,479
observation via the footprints in the

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,860
sand have five toes so then we can count

57
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,169
observe

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,510
the footprints are about 25 centimeters

59
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:20,459
long to measure that the space between

60
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:22,679
each pair of footprints is about 60

61
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,260
centimeters those are three observations

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,000
for this image inferences three

63
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,310
inferences first imager and animal made

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,379
these footprints say a human made these

65
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,710
footprints and the human was walking

66
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,349
we're inferring that sure if it was

67
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:40,349
walking could be running but based on

68
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:44,219
the spacing we're gonna infer that this

69
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:46,560
individual was walking so go through

70
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,020
last example here observations and

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,959
inferences so I want you to pause the

72
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,880
video now and make some observations in

73
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,959
some inferences for this particular

74
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,909
image here hopefully you pause the video

75
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,860
there made some observations and

76
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:04,139
inferences now I want to do that same

77
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,860
process again a little bit more

78
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,769
information

79
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,840
now what observations and inferences can

80
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,840
you make from this position number two

81
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,259
hopefully you're done pausing the video

82
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,479
there watching this one last time one

83
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,859
third time here for position three so

84
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:25,768
make some observations and some

85
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:28,170
inferences for position three so you can

86
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,909
see how as we gain more information

87
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:33,238
you're able to make a little bit more

88
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:35,819
precise inferences maybe and also be

89
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,009
very careful on making pure observations

90
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,079
that aren't a mental processor aren't

91
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:45,389
influenced by maybe our opinions or

92
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:49,080
biases ok last image here taking a look

93
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,539
here the the ferry here located between

94
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,459
rocky hill and Glastonbury Connecticut I

95
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,379
want you just to observe this and I've

96
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,420
got a couple questions on the next slide

97
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,979
so if you take about pause the video

98
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,439
here take about 30 seconds to look at

99
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,179
everything and in and around ferry the

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,099
scenery in the background the foreground

101
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,379
what's on the ferries on and so forth

102
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:11,099
let's see how good your observation

103
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:13,169
skills are after you've taken a pause

104
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,228
there so you can answer these questions

105
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,939
here how many vehicles are on the ferry

106
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,519
what's the color of the van on the ferry

107
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,680
are there any other votes damaged what's

108
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,538
the name of the barge what direction was

109
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,430
a ferry traveling and how many people do

110
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:28,649
you see on the ferry

111
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,930
you can go back and compare and take a

112
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:33,060
look and so you can compare your answers

113
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,160
I have the last slide being the answers

114
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,530
and you're welcome to then go through

115
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,870
and compare your answers the ones I

116
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:41,519
provided here hopefully are very good

117
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,860
making observations and making

118
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,299
inferences and being able to distinguish

119
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,300
the difference between the two
