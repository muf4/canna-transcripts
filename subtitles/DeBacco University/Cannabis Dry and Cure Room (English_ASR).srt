1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,799
if the picture here of cannabis plants

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,108
drying in wine barrels showing line

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,300
that's curing they kind of give the idea

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:12,509
of the for cannabis the drying and

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,490
curing process is very important to kind

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,660
of finish off or finalize that end

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,539
product so the basics of a cure or dry

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,579
room is this room doesn't require a lot

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,410
but what it is required is essential for

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,969
a good finish to that final product you

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,899
don't want to lose it at the end there

12
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,169
you want to make sure it dries down

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:34,140
efficiently dries down well to hopefully

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,079
show some of the best traits of these

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,590
final what the plant has produced here

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,450
as the final product so waiting well I

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,550
want to keep that minimum or basically

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,680
when we're lighting a dry or curing want

19
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:49,468
to keep that is minimal or as least as

20
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,909
possible for as those buds are curing

21
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,550
want to keep them in a dark environment

22
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,529
and see here there's some lights and

23
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,929
that's probably just for the picture but

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,730
overall very dark environment dry racks

25
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:01,289
are advised this can minimize a total

26
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,869
space required and allow for adequate

27
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,159
air circulation something is required in

28
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:05,879
the dryer if your room is air

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,100
circulation

30
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,060
- cram all the plants in there we want

31
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,919
to also allow air to be exchanged

32
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,210
there's different procedures some

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,790
growers have different ideas about how

34
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:19,829
exactly the dry or cure or what the room

35
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,900
should look like some will dry the

36
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,179
entire branch we kind of see hanging

37
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,380
here others will only drive the buds and

38
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,799
will trim the buds and that's ahead of

39
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:30,359
time also that trimming allows for that

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,368
drying process to occur a little bit

41
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,859
more efficiently reduces the chance of

42
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:37,379
mold developing all those kind of leaves

43
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,420
also with the buds can increase the

44
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,158
trapping of moisture in there and Meccan

45
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,950
increase the chance of getting mold

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,049
which we want to try to avoid during in

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,509
the total process but also during the

48
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,368
special drying here then those all these

49
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,140
buds are very close together so if one

50
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,090
was to become infected with mold it'd be

51
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,939
very easy for that to spread throughout

52
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,469
the entire room here last we want to

53
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,569
make sure we're monitoring conditions to

54
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:02,759
check progress we had to catch potential

55
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,648
problems early so something was to go

56
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,030
awry or something wants to get out of

57
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,649
whack we want to catch that early

58
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,259
because we can't have that final end

59
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,900
product all in one location so that

60
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,809
monitoring and checking is very

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,030
important

62
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,569
I'm sure it could finish and minimize

63
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,568
the loss
