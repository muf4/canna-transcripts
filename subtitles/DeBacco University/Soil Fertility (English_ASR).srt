1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,318
here we're gonna look at soil fertility

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,508
and what kind of defines a soil is being

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,129
fertile a lot of times you may hear that

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,719
it's very fertile soil well what's that

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,910
actually mean here we'll look at some

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,259
more of the details behind that so in

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,059
particular the definition of sir

8
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,850
fertility is the building the soils to

9
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:19,169
sustain agricultural plant growth this

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,510
is by supplying essential plant

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,039
nutrients in water to allow that lay the

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,810
plant to grow but also reach

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,599
reproduction reach its full lifecycle

14
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,549
this conduct has to occur also in the

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,559
absence of toxic substances which mean

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,630
hit it plant growth so the higher is

17
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,369
soil is in soil fertility not only is it

18
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,219
allowing for plant growth it's allowing

19
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:40,828
it to be just phase of reproduction but

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,890
there's also an absence of harmful

21
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,689
substances now through several

22
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,128
conditions that contribute to soil

23
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,679
fertility such as root depth training

24
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,149
soil moisture proper pH and nutrients

25
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,149
this gives you just a little bit so

26
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,308
profile the horizons Oh organic is at

27
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,500
the very top a is very near the surface

28
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:59,968
the B is the subsoil which is pretty

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,058
much the extent in which the roots will

30
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,439
reach see the substrate name is where

31
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,739
roots are not going to reach and then

32
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,868
our we have as bedrock here now looking

33
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,579
particularly at root depth sufficient

34
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,469
soil depth for adequate root growth and

35
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,239
water retention so I want to make sure

36
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:18,298
that the soil is not just you know very

37
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,310
shallow that can cause some issues with

38
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,840
plants as they develop their roots see

39
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,118
kind of a profile here of a soil this is

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,030
a tree and we can kind of see that they

41
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,340
that root depth not doesn't quite go as

42
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,170
far as some may think is definite a

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,450
couple large area allowing for adequate

44
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,879
nutrient and water absorption as well as

45
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,380
anchoring this plant in the ground then

46
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,569
there's drainage a good drainage to

47
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,519
providing carburation roots here we see

48
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,679
a pitchfork being plunged into the soil

49
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,228
here we can kind of break the soil here

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,180
and help increase duration roots need to

51
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:49,859
respire they need to take it oxidant to

52
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,170
breathe to grow properly so you don't

53
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,299
want them soaking in water for a long

54
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,159
periods of time for most plants that's

55
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,479
not going to be good results that's

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,829
gonna be evidence of poor soil fertility

57
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,629
we have soil moisture so we do need to

58
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:06,599
have some moisture in the soil and that

59
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,818
is so the root zone needs to maintain a

60
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,949
proper moisture this means it's not one

61
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,958
logged or it's not too dry it's kind of

62
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,159
that nice even about the physical

63
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,409
properties of the soil

64
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,159
can impact this such as the particle

65
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,049
size here

66
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,990
how many large or small particles that

67
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,969
have kind of sandy that clay gravel

68
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,010
based that can really impact the ability

69
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:29,280
for a soil to maintain moisture levels

70
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:31,500
we have the proper soil pH so soil pH in

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,539
the range of 6 to 7 in fevering that

72
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,340
slightly acidic to neutral is preferred

73
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,319
and this is again speaking for most

74
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,789
plants there are a couple plants for

75
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,949
example like blueberries you for growing

76
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:43,859
in there looking at much more of the

77
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:46,769
acidic range here this various compiler

78
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,540
8 sales above 7 so we're just looking at

79
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,180
this pH range typically right around

80
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,769
neutral most nutrients are available to

81
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,010
class so that's where most are going to

82
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,870
prefer 6 to 7 the nutrients to support

83
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,090
plant growth we want the optimum rates

84
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,310
of nutrients that our plant available so

85
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,950
what this term plant-available means is

86
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,750
that the plant can take them up some

87
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:08,879
soils for different properties or

88
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,889
different issues may have a high amount

89
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,479
of nutrients in them but they may be

90
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,009
here the term called they're locked up

91
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,629
nutrients there are nutrients that

92
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,609
aren't able to be pulled out by the

93
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,159
plant so we want to have that kind of

94
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,870
that maximum growth maximum yield want

95
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,840
to have those nutrients being highly

96
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,539
plants available which often is provided

97
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,159
through a proper pH of the soil so just

98
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,389
a couple things that help contribute to

99
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,389
the term soil fertility
