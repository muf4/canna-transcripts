1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,599
okay here I'm ready going over the top

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,910
ten plant problems from the 2019 growing

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,649
season even though I'm sure that these

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,929
have been seen in the past and will very

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,910
likely be seen also going forward in the

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,830
future so when we're talking about

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,780
disease we want to first talk about the

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,028
things that it takes in order to get a

9
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,399
disease may the pathogen this could be a

10
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:23,309
bacteria fungus or a virus a susceptible

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,288
host a favorable environment in time for

12
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,750
all ways to interact in order to get the

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,420
disease so all three or three four if we

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,189
had time these factors must come in

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,739
contact with one another to get a

16
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,630
full-blown disease so counter acting or

17
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,250
preventing any one of these will prevent

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,920
the disease which might seem like it's

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,628
really easy but they can be very common

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,329
and very quick to spread giving the

21
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,699
right a lineup of conditions so when we

22
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,489
haven't issued we want to classify it a

23
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,550
virus nutrient insects fungi bacteria in

24
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:55,709
the grower are all main classification

25
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,299
areas with viruses it's kind of tough in

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,710
plants because there's not they're not

27
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,169
living there's really no cure for them

28
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,058
nutrients we tend to see occurrences

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,710
happen across a field and they can have

30
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:06,688
some very characteristic appearances

31
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,389
insects cement they can happen overnight

32
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:11,359
or in other cases they'll only attack

33
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,950
certain varieties we may have in a field

34
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:17,700
fungi that's why I have these fungicides

35
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,159
because it's a major area of problems

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,680
bacteria can be difficult to control not

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,390
necessarily super common in the

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,070
Northeast but certain years they

39
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,599
definitely are more common and then the

40
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,000
grower can also be the issue which can

41
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,469
be the hardest one to admit so if we're

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,328
looking here we have blossom and Rotten

43
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,069
Tomatoes and that set something dark and

44
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,828
region here it's also current on this

45
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:40,709
fruit down here now this is a calcium

46
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:43,438
deficiency so in all these slides I'm

47
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,419
going to occur include these resource

48
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,769
links these are also in the description

49
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,290
so if you go down to the description of

50
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,899
this video find the links to resources

51
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,520
you'll also find these links and they

52
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,280
were all checked at the post the day

53
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,599
this video was posted on to be active so

54
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,090
hopefully they still are when you got a

55
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,218
look at in speaking stick you'll early

56
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,109
to calcium deficiency it's a rots part

57
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:06,569
rotted spot that tends to start towards

58
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:08,219
the blossom end must be occurring

59
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:09,750
typically in to visit are longer because

60
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,008
that calcium basically runs out before

61
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,650
it gets to the end and that's why you

62
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:16,048
get the rotten appearance down here I'm

63
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,810
can occur particularly in high tunnels

64
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,430
with a lot of irrigation events because

65
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,750
simply we're flushing out you know

66
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,790
leaching out some of the calcium that

67
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,930
would be in the soil how to prevent it

68
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:28,590
while getting a soil test to know if

69
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,610
you're low tissue test as well and

70
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,289
making sure you're fertilizing with

71
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,120
calcium in particular if you're doing a

72
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:35,699
lot of irrigation events in high tunnels

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,408
for example Eilis to products here and a

74
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,959
resource link to give you some more

75
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:43,139
information continuing on we have

76
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,658
potassium and magnesium deficiency they

77
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:48,119
can occur both in melons and tomatoes we

78
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,888
see a zoomed in version here potassium

79
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,280
in particular looking at the margins and

80
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:56,579
magnesium here on the tomato so speaking

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,959
specifically to potassium okay what to

82
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,250
look for is browning of the leaf of

83
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,810
margin so don't just say leaves are

84
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,938
browning if it looks particularly this

85
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,519
tomato leaf this bean leaf here the

86
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:06,989
margins are what's burning if you're

87
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,459
growing tomatoes it can also know

88
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,799
sometimes a yellow shoulders can be

89
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,049
another indication of that occurring

90
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,450
within Tomatoes particularly again in

91
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,859
high tunnels how to prevent well when

92
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:18,119
you're irrigating you might want to

93
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,760
irrigate with potassium product

94
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,810
particularly during the plant growth or

95
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,969
at the end of the plant growth into

96
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,009
fruit development Buffet's sulfate

97
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:28,049
potassium zero zero 50 is very potent

98
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:30,328
source soon enough to use a lot of it to

99
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,340
get the necessary amount kelp is often

100
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:35,129
touted has been great in potassium but

101
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,878
it may have it may find it difficult to

102
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:40,948
add the quantities of kelp potassium in

103
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,478
kelp that you may need when your plants

104
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,519
are going to maximum fruit load and

105
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,979
fruit set and a couple of resource links

106
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,259
here continuing on to magnesium

107
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:50,699
deficiency again in tomatoes those lower

108
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,649
leaves will start to get this yellow

109
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,690
appearance it's intervener chlorosis is

110
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,430
what you're looking for typically starts

111
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:59,669
at fruit set and you want to monitor

112
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,199
your plants the fix can be actually

113
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,090
quite easy epsom salts starting at a

114
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,709
rate of one tablespoon per gallon and

115
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,269
that can be applied to the leaves and

116
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,759
also as a soil drench

117
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,289
also if you're using a Cal mag product

118
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,908
can be advised you're getting the

119
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:14,459
calcium different blossom end rot in

120
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:16,199
tomatoes and also some magnesium and

121
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,449
just keep in mind down here we also have

122
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:23,250
some link to a resource link for you

123
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:25,830
continuing on we have squash bug nymphs

124
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,720
so these are insects of course that can

125
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:28,430
occur

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,230
you tend not to find just one of them

127
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,150
tend to find em in clusters

128
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,860
this is vistas are basically hatching

129
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:35,870
and this is then a little bit more

130
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,030
advanced but not quite at the adult

131
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,769
stage these two stages are the key

132
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:44,029
points if you want to apply a control

133
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:45,709
product so our management of squash bugs

134
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:47,869
well what to look for there are all

135
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:49,699
these large brown deals when they crush

136
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,920
they smell like sour apple this one is

137
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,389
actively laying eggs here how to prevent

138
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,080
them will insect knitting is the only

139
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,669
real option

140
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,199
Spray products if you are going to apply

141
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,640
them this would be the time to apply

142
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,110
them because they're much easier to kill

143
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,329
here before they get this kind of

144
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,069
armored plating to them couple on

145
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:07,699
control products mentioned here as well

146
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:09,199
as some resource links Alton area or

147
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:11,420
early blight in tomatoes this is a very

148
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,740
classic sign here well there might be a

149
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,420
little nowadays in Division C going on

150
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,160
what we're focused on here is this brown

151
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,420
region right here it almost looks like

152
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,250
you've cut down a tree you can kind of

153
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,520
see the rings of a tree this is a

154
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,139
classic Alton area or early blight now

155
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,659
early blight on tomatoes we want to look

156
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,399
for our small black specks located on

157
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,200
the lower leaves it'll start out as that

158
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,449
then it will kind of progress to this

159
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,668
more Brown region that have rings like a

160
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,050
tree you want to limit soil splash a

161
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,089
neutral light penetration into the

162
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,629
canopy I'll get some control products

163
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:43,369
and some information here provided

164
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:45,620
verticillium on cucurbits and eggplant

165
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,629
so kind of looking at the brown regions

166
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,889
which you might initially get confused

167
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:51,350
where looks similar to potassium

168
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:54,110
deficiency there's some key factors here

169
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,450
with verticillium for verticillium we

170
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,220
look for is a V burn to the leaf margins

171
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,409
is characteristic so in some cases

172
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,240
virtus m only affect half of the leaf

173
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,790
but for those potassium would be across

174
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,680
the whole leaf very very common in

175
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,169
eggplants especially been growing in the

176
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,000
same area year after year and you

177
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,709
carrots the more of the entirely if you

178
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,899
don't quite get this a dramatic effect

179
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:16,250
on how to prevent it is crop rotations

180
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:18,739
and keeping an eye out for it when you

181
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,360
do see it no one can eat to rotate since

182
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,610
its soil base is very little you can do

183
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,530
so that's why that in season you want to

184
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,569
keep those rotations going and a couple

185
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,299
of resource links provided resource link

186
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:31,040
provided there at the bottom leaf mold

187
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,629
on Tomatoes well it'll stick from the

188
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,120
upper portion release hysterectomy or

189
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:37,490
portion lead and make a good hand model

190
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,649
sometime this is looking at the

191
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,280
comparisons of how leaf mold looks at

192
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,039
the top

193
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:45,799
and underside of the leaf so what I look

194
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,360
for is those fuzzies illusions either in

195
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,090
the top or bottom of the leaves

196
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,530
typically in areas that are protected

197
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:52,599
commonly in high tunnels in shady areas

198
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:55,309
where there can be a lot of moisture

199
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,900
that's kind of accumulating this disease

200
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,879
can spread very quickly especially if

201
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:00,319
there's high humidity so when you first

202
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,990
detect it's recommend you kind of get

203
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,339
the control product applied and trying

204
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,990
to maintain good air circulation with

205
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,329
Timmy hasn't can be through pruning and

206
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,949
over and avoid over feeding plants with

207
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:11,719
nitrogen that will cause an excess

208
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,430
foliage and increase the odds of

209
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,350
creating as high humidity environments

210
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,560
couple control products and also some

211
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,300
resource right powdery mildew

212
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,709
I'm the effectiveness of spray control

213
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,840
so powdery mildew we will try to

214
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25,609
identify at this stage because once we

215
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,949
see it at this stage it can spread very

216
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,050
quickly it's a little bit more common

217
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,560
this is typically what you'll see in the

218
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,689
field

219
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,250
however this leaf is very unique because

220
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,560
this girl was actually applying the

221
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,149
powdery mildew control products they're

222
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,740
like well they still have powdery but if

223
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:41,899
you notice in the center portion of the

224
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,759
leaf where that liquids gonna accumulate

225
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:46,189
kind of run down the center stalk here

226
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,019
where that product had the most contact

227
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:50,209
time with the leaf was definitely

228
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:52,459
preventing it from occurring these upper

229
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:54,079
curled up portions of the leaf higher

230
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:56,629
odds of getting powdery some because

231
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,069
there's less contact control I'm so very

232
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:59,659
important to notice that this grower is

233
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,969
actively sprang they should continue

234
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,300
because it is working where it's coming

235
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,070
in contact what to look for again this

236
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,110
is kind of that early detection the

237
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,668
earlier you can detect it the better you

238
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,110
want to look in the shadier regions the

239
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:13,219
underside of leaves this is the top

240
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,479
portion late that was Shady

241
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,940
they have to pull down and get in the

242
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,039
sunning at the picture also when you're

243
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,478
looking for powdery it's actually wise

244
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,460
to take your sunglasses off because the

245
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,219
polarization of the lenses as you turn

246
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:29,259
your head can actually hide some of the

247
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:32,240
smaller kind of fungus because it's a 3d

248
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,559
especially when it early thumb starts if

249
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,149
possibly want to select resistant

250
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,579
varieties and there's a whole bunch of

251
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:39,860
organic and chemical options for powdery

252
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,080
a lot of research has been done on it we

253
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,330
have a lot of resource links here the

254
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,250
best organic approach would be 40

255
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,110
percent milk and 60 percent water as

256
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,000
long as you apply that at least once a

257
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,529
week that can really slow down the

258
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,529
spread of powdery

259
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,620
so two that look very similar or

260
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,930
leafmold

261
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,879
and powdery mildew so this is leaf mold

262
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:02,829
on the underside this is the upper side

263
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,689
where we're seeing these leaf mold

264
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,490
regions are here in here we see the

265
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,590
powdery powdery tens have that cleaner

266
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:15,789
whiter appearance while we've pulled

267
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:17,500
that more brownish kind of lesions the

268
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,000
leaf bowls compared to powdering what to

269
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,190
look for again that left image of those

270
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,750
white spots of the powdery the El spots

271
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,160
are the leaf mold and here on the right

272
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,509
image we're seeing that same thing the

273
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,679
white spots seem non-existent

274
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:28,778
this case powders are occurring at the

275
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,759
top the leaf a lower portions here of

276
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:32,169
the brown how to prevent there's many

277
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,700
different options you might want to have

278
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,689
something on hand because once you see

279
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,640
this you want to be able to get out and

280
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,760
sprayed to control it to slow down its

281
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,689
spread getting antibacterial leaf spot

282
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,330
tomatoes and peppers

283
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,540
pepper plants tomato this is

284
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,790
characteristic of bacterial leaf spot

285
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:50,860
this is also that tree leaf spot this is

286
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:52,539
what it looks like on a larger scale it

287
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,669
starts as a small little dark specks

288
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:56,049
that are typically circular I can be

289
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:58,000
seen on both the leaves in the fruits

290
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:01,120
that's another concern for retail sale

291
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,409
we varied by the cultivar I want to

292
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,330
prevent it is trying to reduce soil

293
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:07,449
splash which is grower did here by

294
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,100
putting the mulch down we could see was

295
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,629
a very wet year and it tends to affect

296
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,940
that Loire region first and was

297
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:15,399
spreading down the whole row and also

298
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,100
off the plant fungicides will not work

299
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:21,970
so when I use a bacterial side copper or

300
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,930
oxidate or ko side are recommended

301
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,120
options that fall into this

302
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:26,829
classification check your local laws for

303
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,779
what can be used and here's a couple of

304
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,470
resource links to help learn a little

305
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:34,539
bit more if you identify bacterial spec

306
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,610
yellow vine decline on yvd that's it's

307
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:38,259
kind of yelling to the leaves it's not

308
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,029
necessarily the vines that yeah so it's

309
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:41,889
kind of misleading but we kind of get

310
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,750
this limey green appearance and a

311
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:46,509
concern as a single plant and spread to

312
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,649
other plants so it's becoming a bigger

313
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:50,080
issue that is kind of getting

314
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,699
misdiagnosed it tends to come in list

315
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,528
I'm noticing a little more common in

316
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,810
southern New England at times of high

317
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:58,120
heat so it's getting misdiagnosed as

318
00:10:55,809 --> 00:11:01,059
heat stress simply because it will cause

319
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,129
the actual fruit in this case washed

320
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:04,869
abort which is typically when we get

321
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,370
high heat that can happen but yellow

322
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,240
vine declines a little bit more serious

323
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,850
than that because those

324
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,830
plants will continue to abort even after

325
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,200
the temperatures may cool down after a

326
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,190
recent heatwave how to control this well

327
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,839
there's nearly nothing you can do

328
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,459
because it is a bacteria you have to

329
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,410
control the squash bugs because they are

330
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:22,299
the vector so preventing or controlling

331
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:24,819
squash bugs will prevent and control

332
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:25,769
yellow vine decline using instant

333
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,520
netting would be the best option

334
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,139
something needs to get a little bit more

335
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,528
attention cuz I think it's again getting

336
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:34,809
misdiagnosed and it's happening in more

337
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:36,480
fields than we may originally think up

338
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:39,069
to this point in time

339
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,450
lastly getting the last of the top 10 I

340
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,100
didn't order them didn't number them

341
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,399
there's really no exact order these

342
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,350
grower errors with the advantage of high

343
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,639
tunnels or even field growing we want to

344
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,000
make sure we're keeping everything nice

345
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,470
neat organized clean and easy to spot

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,200
potential errors that may be occurring

347
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,300
I'm having irrigation setup having

348
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,620
things pruned correctly getting ready

349
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:01,838
for the harvest and being able to walk

350
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,310
down and gonna see down the row these

351
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,800
are all key things that a girl can be

352
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:09,338
doing correctly of course in the ideal

353
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:11,079
situation the season extension talking

354
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:12,310
particularly to high tunnels you want to

355
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,220
be sure at the end of the season you are

356
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:17,259
cleaning them it's issues can occur

357
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,570
usually not just one plant will occur

358
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:21,819
across the entire tunnel so you want to

359
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,440
be taking the time to scout these and

360
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,360
document your practices so if you do

361
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,130
something right or good you're able to

362
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,149
document that and repeat that so it

363
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:30,759
doesn't go right you can kind of go back

364
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:31,778
and see what you may have done wrong how

365
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,159
to control it well it's a kind of a

366
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:34,269
self-reflection kind of hope you don't

367
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,649
get to the end of the year we have you

368
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,778
know squared or it's pulling up a lot of

369
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:40,328
money you're able to kind of prevent

370
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:42,070
problems keeping the structures clean is

371
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:43,659
a great way this can often be overlooked

372
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,190
especially in the busyness of the season

373
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:47,639
you want to reduce the potential for

374
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,660
disease carry over into next season and

375
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,338
insect netting would be a great thing to

376
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:51,939
add to your I tells both the vents and

377
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:53,770
doorways

378
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,940
it's your limit also local pest pressure

379
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,789
because you're creating a nice warm

380
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,220
environment so just be mindful document

381
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:02,528
what you need what you're doing so that

382
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,810
it can be repeated in the case of it

383
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:06,850
could season so hopefully this was

384
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:09,609
helpful in the top 10 plant growing

385
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,839
problems for 2019 season and if you've

386
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,789
seen some problems we've had in the past

387
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,640
or going forward this is helpful

388
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:17,769
that would be hopefully these links and

389
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,600
gets you ahead to at least identify what

390
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,980
issue you may be having so you can help

391
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,778
control it to redo

392
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,899
to reoccurrence or the spreading of the

393
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:24,899
issue
