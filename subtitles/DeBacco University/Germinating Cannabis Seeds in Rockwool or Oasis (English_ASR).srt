welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,679
if you're looking at this video you're

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:06,878
probably looking at dribbling your

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:10,558
cannabis seeds in

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,039
rockwell or oasis and debacle university

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,439
here

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,079
is to provide you with some helpful tips

8
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,710
and tricks

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:24,969
to increase the odds of your success

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,560
let's get into the video specifics well

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,639
first off when we're looking at

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,198
germany's seeds we have to keep in mind

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,759
that

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,800
we have some basics to be sure we're

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,000
adhering to

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,359
want to make sure the seed is from a

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,439
certified source we're keeping the

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,439
temperature within the accepted ranges

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,558
moisture level target level air

21
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,280
percentage depth

22
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,039
and light all need to be adhered to for

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,640
the basic environment to help ensure the

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,000
environment is supportive

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,920
of basic seed germination properties

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,679
now why would you use rockwell or oasis

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,120
well natural properties of both

28
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,759
are conducive to early plant

29
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,878
establishment both materials hold water

30
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,479
well while still providing roots

31
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,399
adequate air exchange allowing them to

32
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,079
respire and essentially breathe

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,320
and they often come in space efficient

34
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,000
trays with individual cubes per cut

35
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,478
which allow for very efficient

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,359
production on both a small scale as well

37
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,599
as a large scale so what are some

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,959
specifics particularly to rock wool

39
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,280
you want to typically soak your rock

40
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,519
well first before planting seeds in it

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
sometimes this may require soaking in

42
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,879
water that's ph tested

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,479
and if it's not required it might be a

44
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,239
good idea and should be something pretty

45
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,438
quick and easy for you to do

46
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,959
typically the small cubes are

47
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,478
recommended no matter where the ceiling

48
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,359
will be going for the rest of the growth

49
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,959
cycle

50
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,719
because they can be put into larger

51
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,118
blocks as we see here

52
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,560
common used example would be the grodan

53
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,159
o a cubes

54
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
they're a kind of name brand but they're

55
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,159
very established particularly in the

56
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,079
rockwool arena there for propagation

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,920
now as the plant grows we want to keep

58
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,879
this in mind that as the plant's growing

59
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,799
the cubes

60
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,239
are designed to fit into larger blocks

61
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,399
as we can see here is a small

62
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,319
cube that can easily be placed into this

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,718
larger block as a pre-cut hole

64
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,359
to allow during the trans planting

65
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,519
process

66
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,919
minimal root disturbance this is where

67
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,199
grodan block delta for example

68
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,199
they sell a series of different

69
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,519
sizes that all fit into one another that

70
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,719
allow for that natural progression

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
for a growing plant now both substrates

72
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,639
this is again for rockwell

73
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,480
and oasis are easily put into trays for

74
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,159
easy mass production in a small

75
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,759
area you can grow a lot of plants in a

76
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,280
very small square footage which is

77
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,959
advantageous

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,560
leave one planting spot empty though if

79
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,120
you're using a tray and particularly in

80
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
the middle

81
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,000
so that the water and the tray can be

82
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,318
properly determined to make sure you're

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,120
not under or over watering

84
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,799
your newly developing seedlings and

85
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,039
again this is true for both

86
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,719
substrates they can also be used for

87
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,039
clones as well as seeds

88
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,639
but here provide you hopeful with some

89
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,318
quick kind of general

90
00:02:52,639 --> 00:03:00,958
tips for germinating your seeds

91
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,958
in either rockwell or oasis
