1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:06,059
ok this video lectures in meiosis I

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:08,609
suggest you watch the other one that I

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:11,308
have on mitosis first because a lot of

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:15,599
these same steps repeat and use the same

5
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:17,278
terms so starting with meiosis here now

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,948
we're talking about meiosis we want to

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:22,109
be mindful of comparing it to mitosis

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,810
and we're gonna see these comparisons

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,179
done quite a bit mitosis is starting

10
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,129
with this diploid cell which is a normal

11
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,920
cell in your body and it's making two

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,649
identical copies meiosis here we're

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,660
taking that same initial start to the

14
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,480
cell we're going to end up with actually

15
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:42,569
four cells in the end that each have

16
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,488
half of the total genetic material do

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,140
another comparison here where we see our

18
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,538
parent cell we have this replication

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,280
phase and from that replication phase we

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,260
can go to mitosis which you could see

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,020
here is forming two identical copies of

22
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:58,229
the parent cell or meiosis here were

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,609
forming four total cells each with half

24
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:05,908
of the total genetic material so some of

25
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,859
the terms sister chromatids is one this

26
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,100
refers to e to either of the two

27
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,400
identical copies chromatids formed by

28
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,079
replication from a single chromosome

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,140
with both copies joined together with

30
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,509
his centromere so here's our chromosome

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,519
here here's our centromeres at center

32
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,099
location also represented here our

33
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:30,569
sister chromatids are those two things

34
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:34,978
two chromosomes joined together here in

35
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:38,250
that centromere together these make the

36
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:40,039
sister chromatid now there's also

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,840
something called daughter chromosomes

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,479
now these are appeard chromatids or

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,368
sister chromatids eventually separate

40
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,769
fewer dear separate and become daughter

41
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:52,950
chromosomes at the end of mitosis

42
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:55,739
daughter chromosomes are properly spaced

43
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,770
out in allocated to the different two

44
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,048
daughter cells together their sister

45
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:04,048
chromatids or from Anna chromosome

46
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,600
that's represented here or separated

47
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,649
their daughter chromosomes so I know

48
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,818
this is just sounds a little confusing

49
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,699
the difference between daughter

50
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,649
chromosomes and sister chromatids the

51
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,289
key part here the sister chromatids

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,799
actually joined the data chromosomes are

53
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:22,348
separated so getting into what's the

54
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:25,110
purpose of meiosis well for sexual

55
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:27,119
reproduction and for plants that seed

56
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,540
formation is basically to get to the

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,938
next generation spreading out the the

58
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:36,000
genes to then produce either in this

59
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:39,930
case it be pollen grains it could be on

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,329
forming in church seeds to be able to

61
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,870
make a new plant or a new person in this

62
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:48,780
case so first we have to understand two

63
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,969
key terms here first one is somatic

64
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,979
cells these are any cell a living

65
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:56,848
organism that is not a reproductive cell

66
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:59,219
here we have and endoderm lima mesoderm

67
00:02:56,848 --> 00:03:01,560
and ectoderm i and all the somatic cells

68
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,658
they go through and they confirm these

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,389
stem cells and they're forming lung

70
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:08,969
tissue the pancreas the heart or red

71
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:11,670
blood cells skin or neurons all these

72
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:13,318
are somatic cells they are also diploid

73
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:15,238
meaning they contain two sets of

74
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:18,268
chromosomes one from each parent

75
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,128
so one from mom one from dad these were

76
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,709
plant cells it could be leaves in roots

77
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:26,280
and shoots and stems and they would also

78
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,939
have one chromosome from the male plant

79
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,650
and one chromosome from the female plant

80
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,658
we talk about gametes this is these are

81
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,189
single cells produced by adult organisms

82
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:37,048
that are specialized for meaning and

83
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:39,180
only at half the number of chromosomes

84
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,159
and thus we call them haploids

85
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,099
they're the single set of unpaired

86
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,888
chromosomes so the former site oh we

87
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,959
need a sperm cell in an egg cell to come

88
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,510
together and this is the first cell the

89
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,789
new individual this zygote here you will

90
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:56,009
see the ovules in a plant you receive

91
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:58,289
pollen grains if these two come together

92
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:01,828
that's from the fruit here these are an

93
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:03,568
example would be Tomatoes looking a

94
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,639
little bit closer at comparing the two

95
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:09,238
how ployed is usually represented with

96
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:12,799
just a letter n and diploid is 2n help

97
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:16,978
haploid sperm fertilizes a haploid egg

98
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,978
the resulting diploid zygote yourself up

99
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,560
here diploid zygote receives one copy of

100
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,870
each gene from mother and one from

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,360
father so here we see the example here

102
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,800
how ployed eggs in a haploid sperm

103
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,658
come together to from the diploid zygote

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,788
this is me the start of the new

105
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:36,060
individual same thing here

106
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:38,759
how boy sperm haploid egg forming a new

107
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:43,949
individual also and this is diploid one

108
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:47,520
copy from mom one copy from dad so a two

109
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:50,370
divisions of meiosis one cell divides

110
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,218
into two and then each of those divide

111
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,348
again resulting in four total cells so

112
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:57,718
unlike mitosis where we were forming two

113
00:04:55,348 --> 00:05:01,110
identical copies here performing four

114
00:04:57,718 --> 00:05:04,408
unique cells through very similar phases

115
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,870
prophase metaphase anaphase and

116
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:09,449
telophase one and then the same thing

117
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,848
repeats prophase metaphase anaphase and

118
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,870
telophase all represented to will go

119
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:15,959
into these a little bit more detail

120
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,579
sorry with prophase one chromosomes coil

121
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:20,008
becomes shorter and thicker nuclear

122
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:21,930
envelope in nucleolus dissociate apart

123
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,210
chromatids can be seen centromere is

124
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,389
performing at microtubules attach kind

125
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:30,089
of later prophase in mitosis seeing that

126
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,460
condensing here of the chromosomes we

127
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:34,198
could see our centrioles developing the

128
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,329
chromosomes are condensing the nucleus

129
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,598
breaking down and this is term crossing

130
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:41,878
over is important during prophase one

131
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:44,158
crossing over can occur this is a very

132
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,050
important thinking that happens in

133
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:48,240
prophase one it's a process where

134
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,550
homologous chromosomes pair up with each

135
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,259
other in exchange different segments of

136
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,870
their genetic material to form

137
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,120
recombinant chromosomes what does this

138
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,379
mean when we have longest chromosomes

139
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,379
and these urges could be the same

140
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:03,689
chromosome one for example and they line

141
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,250
up next to one another what's crossing

142
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:07,110
over is because these are homologous

143
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,240
meaningly essentially encodes in the

144
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,729
same thing one could be from mom one

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,769
could be from dad crossing over meaning

146
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:16,438
a section could break off this chromatid

147
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:18,778
and rejoining here and this is what's

148
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,870
causing or what we call crossing over

149
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:26,069
because a piece is crossing over here we

150
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,658
have a white and a black chromosome here

151
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,310
we get crossing over and we see to get a

152
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:31,319
kind of a stripe to a parents gonna wait

153
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,598
in the black the white and a black of

154
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,729
the white in a black this is crossing

155
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:37,829
over mean these were unique genetics

156
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:40,769
separated out now they're kind of joined

157
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:43,258
together this isn't

158
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:45,180
for example on metaphase the chromosomes

159
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:47,400
align at the equator and spindle fibers

160
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,949
become apparent meditation over the line

161
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,269
at metaphase plate the equator of this

162
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,300
cell here is lined up

163
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:56,008
remember this is metaphase 1 so what it

164
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,030
looks like on a real world image here I

165
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,419
could see everything all lined up

166
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:02,579
distinctly through the dye anaphase 1

167
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:05,698
his chromosomes migrate to the poles

168
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:08,250
again we're getting the pulling part of

169
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,658
our chromosomes now the centromeres are

170
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,579
not broken here that's an important

171
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:12,810
aspect to keep in mind they are still

172
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:14,969
attached the centuries are still

173
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,470
attached but now if we got this one for

174
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,599
Mom this one from dad is very pulled

175
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,900
part here we notice a little crossing

176
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,490
over did occur so anaphase looks like

177
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,848
that pole in the part of those

178
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,340
chromosomes telophase 1 and cytokinesis

179
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:31,168
this is a weak formation of the nucleus

180
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,689
because remember they're gonna divide

181
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:35,698
again you see initially we're starting

182
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,649
to have a nucleus starting to form but

183
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:42,930
that's gonna slowly divide and break

184
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:45,120
apart more here so division 2 similar

185
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,840
but not the exact same process repeats

186
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,668
so be careful in mind flow was different

187
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,769
so here in prophase 2 chromosomes become

188
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:54,598
shorter they never really completely

189
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:56,959
dissociated but they become shorter more

190
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,728
condensed spindle fibers are forming

191
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:03,839
here in metaphase 2 they're lining up

192
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:07,199
again an important part here between

193
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:10,109
metaphase 1 and metaphase 2 if you look

194
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,968
at these images there's three here this

195
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,788
one and this would look very similar

196
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:17,370
this one looks distinctly different we

197
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:19,019
notice here we're gonna hit separation

198
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,959
at the centromere here we're just gonna

199
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:24,060
migrate the chromosomes who knows this

200
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,299
is evident in metaphase - same with this

201
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,550
one

202
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,000
this is metaphase 1 that century will

203
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,579
not be broken in metaphase 1 again

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,259
metaphase 2 here a little bit harder to

205
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,879
see and some of these stained images

206
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:37,639
will get the sense for what that looks

207
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,939
like everything kind of lined up on the

208
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:43,828
equator region anaphase 2 same thing

209
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,529
happens or chromatids separate aligned

210
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:47,399
chromosomes to migrate to the poles

211
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:50,100
important for interphase - were actually

212
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,250
breaking those centromeres and those are

213
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,580
actually migrating to the poles here

214
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,708
teyla phase 2 and cytokinesis

215
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,778
chromosomes become longer new nuclear

216
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,789
envelope develops into the ol Ivy appear

217
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:03,278
new cell walls develop between each of

218
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:04,629
the four groups of chromosomes nuclear

219
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,120
envelope forms around each set of

220
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:09,039
chromosomes in the cytoplasm divides you

221
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,810
could see we're getting a distinct four

222
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:16,449
distinct cells that are forming meiosis

223
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:18,699
stage 1 unless is stage 2 could see kind

224
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,800
of the comparison here the key part here

225
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,040
with minuses or ending up with four

226
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:27,669
cells in the end each with half the

227
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:29,230
total genetic information so to kind of

228
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:32,229
give you a little bit of an animation of

229
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:34,269
what's what's generally occurring most

230
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,589
everything lines up we are just pulling

231
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:40,299
them apart nothing was broken getting

232
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:43,329
our formation and this is for a single

233
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:45,578
egg cell so we'll talk about we get to

234
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:48,179
human development egg cells or le

235
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:50,349
technically one total mature true egg

236
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:52,989
well you can kind of see and replay this

237
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,089
again what's going on how things are

238
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,879
migrating what is these are just moving

239
00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:01,630
across no centromere is broken and then

240
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:02,919
when they do get broken polar bodies

241
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:05,320
will talk about that we do human

242
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:07,509
reproduction so you hear the centromeres

243
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,640
are actually being broken and for the

244
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:12,789
formation of eggs a single egg there's

245
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,679
only one true egg that's formed then

246
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:17,169
important in a good quiz question

247
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:20,229
between mitosis and meiosis here's a

248
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:22,958
great comparison between the two so

249
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:27,269
mitosis again forming those two total

250
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:29,708
cells meiosis forming those four and

251
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:31,809
being able to compare and contrast these

252
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:34,119
two ORS important aspects to show

253
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:36,189
understanding and if you want a couple

254
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,600
more links to some videos here is a

255
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,600
couple that I've provided to
