1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
so here I'm gonna talk about the

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,599
pollination process there's actually

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,839
very important to our basic survival in

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,489
food production of food in general here

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,439
we see an example would be going through

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,528
and doing this exact process I'm going

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,820
to be describing so start with why there

8
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:20,129
are different kinds of flowers so this

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,679
is again pertaining to angiosperms and

10
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,960
the pollination process so insects and

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,429
plants have a co-evolved so that certain

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,830
insects specialize in visiting

13
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,118
particular kinds of flowers a particular

14
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,399
insect carries pollen from one

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,859
individual flower to another of the same

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,808
species these are the most numerous

17
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,609
insect pollinator birds can also

18
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:41,039
pollinate some flowers especially red

19
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,920
ones so if you have hummingbird feeder

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,628
typically you put red dye in it

21
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,059
grasses and some other endosperm have

22
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,729
reverted to wind pollination so just

23
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,628
because there are inset polymers they

24
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:56,849
don't pollinate necessarily everything

25
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:57,468
so beasts and UV light which is

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,140
interesting

27
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:03,539
BC UV light so flowers look different to

28
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,819
them compared to us so remember our

29
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,849
visible light spectrum here UV is

30
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,279
ultraviolet ways so ultraviolet talking

31
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:13,438
we're over here in our light spectrum

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,920
here getting closer to our x-rays and

33
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,469
gamma-rays

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,109
then we are from our infrared or our

35
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,030
radar waves there so it's called

36
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,700
ultraviolet because it's beyond the

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,219
violet spectrum so what we see versus

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,140
what bees are able to see differences in

39
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,209
color sensitivity between humans honey

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,368
bees and hummingbirds is what provides

41
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:35,009
flowers to actually look different I

42
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:37,609
think these are some notable examples so

43
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,469
under normal light we see this as a

44
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:42,209
consistently yellow flower

45
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:44,129
however under UV light this is almost

46
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,228
like a target region that develops in

47
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,399
the center that's where the bees are

48
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:49,618
going to see and so they're going to

49
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,049
target to try to find the the pollen or

50
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,060
the nectar in their case same thing here

51
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,250
normal we see our nice kind of yellow

52
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,009
here under UV light we see that

53
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,750
distinctive darkening center region and

54
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,728
same goes for this flower and also this

55
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,500
flower provides kind of that extra

56
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:09,239
highlight to tell the bees hey come here

57
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,919
this is where the nectar is as I

58
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,569
mentioned those flowers matched a

59
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,949
pollinator so hummingbirds tenda

60
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:17,219
pollinate red flowers in

61
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:19,229
notice they have a very long beak thin

62
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,689
the beak at that and the flowers

63
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:23,549
replicate that bats call me white

64
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,919
flowers and have sweet smells and open

65
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,140
at night those sweet smells are so the

66
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,389
bats can help detect them moths are also

67
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,779
nighttime pollinators and some gourds

68
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:34,979
will calmly very white flowers that open

69
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,379
at night again

70
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:40,018
ants can also pollinate here as we see

71
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,180
here and all this pollen greens overhead

72
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,500
go through and go through the to the

73
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,480
next flower to help transfer some of

74
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,900
that or even help that same flower get

75
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,219
crossed

76
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,689
get pollinated by twin itself

77
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:53,489
pollination process in seed plants free

78
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:56,729
waters not required in fertilization

79
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:58,439
process pollination by insects wind or

80
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:01,199
other agents transfers pollen to an

81
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:04,530
ovule the pollen grain then cracks open

82
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,318
and sprouts as a pollen tube in bringing

83
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,629
the sperm cells directly to the egg what

84
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,098
we see here so here's our flower and

85
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,289
you're not familiar with the parts you

86
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,000
can refer back to some of the other

87
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:17,459
videos that I have particularly

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,979
gymnosperms and angiosperms see the

89
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,159
pollen lands here on the sticky stigma

90
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,590
and its travels down here and a store go

91
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,209
all the way to reach the ovule so

92
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,219
there's no distance that it needs to

93
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,500
travel so just because the pollen is

94
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:34,739
transferred to these stigma doesn't mean

95
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,419
it automatically gets pollinated that

96
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,259
needs to be able to survive and live and

97
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:42,358
be able to travel all this distance now

98
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:44,969
in particular we have something called

99
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:46,560
double fertilization so tubes from or

100
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:48,959
pollen grains are required to produce a

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,539
seed one sperm fertilizes the egg to

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,389
produce that zygote to men the other

103
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:56,189
fertilized polar nuclei to form eight

104
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,650
the three and end of sperm which is the

105
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,680
food source for the embryo so this means

106
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,469
one pollen grain is fertilizing the egg

107
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,450
to produce this I go the other one is

108
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:10,590
fertilizing this area here to produce

109
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:13,589
the food for that seed once in

110
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,120
germinated to initially feed on so we

111
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,310
see here's our pollen grain or pollen

112
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,709
tube two sperm cells coming down both

113
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,538
fertilizing this particular one

114
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,720
technically is fertilizing it the other

115
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:26,879
one is making the endosperm which is the

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,630
food region here so palm green adheres

117
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,019
to the statement

118
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:33,689
two cells generates this cell in tube

119
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:35,909
cell the pollen tube grows into the

120
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:37,529
style generator cell transfers inside

121
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,410
the pollen tube dividing the form to

122
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:42,869
sperm cells the pollen tube penetrates

123
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,270
the opening ovule to calm the macro file

124
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,160
here one of the sperm fertilizes the egg

125
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,959
to form the diploid zygote the other

126
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,240
sperm fertilizes two polar nuclei to

127
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,129
form the triploid endosperm which

128
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,650
becomes the food source for the growing

129
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:58,529
embryo this is an important process that

130
00:04:55,649 --> 00:05:01,379
does occur here's the same image down

131
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:03,239
here this double four ization energy is

132
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,189
produced special highly nutritious

133
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,259
tissue called the endosperm for their

134
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:09,269
seeds when a flower is pollinated the

135
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,819
pollen tube grows down from pollen grain

136
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:14,159
on the stigma pong game contains two

137
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,930
haploid sperm the first worm fuses with

138
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,370
the egg at the base of the ovary the

139
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,400
second firm fuses with the polar nuclei

140
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,290
from the triploid endosperm cell which

141
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,750
divides faster than the zygote and gives

142
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,540
rise to the endosperm tissue remember

143
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,750
this endosperm tissue is the food region

144
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,640
for the cell for the UM seed the process

145
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,439
of fertilization to produce both zygote

146
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,709
and endosperm is called double

147
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,730
fertilization

148
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:43,109
now pollination process is actually

149
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,600
accidental so it's kind of amazing that

150
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,939
something we're so dependent on as far

151
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,920
as sustaining our species providing the

152
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,350
food for the world is actually an

153
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,170
accidental process the pollinator gets

154
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,680
nectar and accidentally transfers pollen

155
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,930
as we see here the male flower so here's

156
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,850
a be going down getting nectar bumping

157
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,560
into this portion transferring pollen

158
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,720
over again the bees more concerned about

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,310
that nectar than the actual pollen the

160
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,700
bee flies out of this flower and this is

161
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,230
a female flower as the squash plant that

162
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,779
produces both and that's why I chose

163
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,310
this to show it distinctively here's the

164
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,500
bead throwing back down here to get the

165
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,410
nectar and now it's kind of taking the

166
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,399
Palmetto the quired here and

167
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,620
transferring it to the stigma here

168
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,329
that's why you typically see these in

169
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,819
these types of flowers with their heads

170
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:31,769
down trying to absorb the nectar down

171
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,990
here they're not really concerned with

172
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:36,269
the transfer of pollen they're more

173
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,100
concerned with the acquisition of the

174
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:40,289
nectar and the pollen that's getting

175
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,990
transferred is simply an accidental

176
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,280
process

177
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,629
we have two parts of pollination is

178
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,189
something called cross-pollination

179
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,959
paalam is transferred between two

180
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,329
different individuals from the same

181
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,909
species here is one flower is another

182
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:55,979
flower sis cross-pollination advantages

183
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,140
increases our genetic variability in the

184
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,780
species but it can produce unfit

185
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,490
individuals versus self pollination

186
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,729
where we see pollen from the same flower

187
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,840
getting poly it with the same flower

188
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,700
this pollen from the same individual is

189
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,469
used to pollinate the same plant the

190
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,959
Evangelist produces seeds when

191
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,420
individuals are isolated the kind of

192
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,919
reduces to genetic variability and

193
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,650
doesn't open the species up to really

194
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,960
adapting much to the environment so

195
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:24,469
again pros and cons to each but both can

196
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,529
occur and produce viable seeds

197
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,940
lastly the lifecycle of an angiosperm

198
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:33,209
tying a lot of the other videos together

199
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,290
tying in some of the flower anatomy some

200
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:37,889
of the terms we discussed previously

201
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:40,670
such as meiosis and mitosis the sperm

202
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,560
cells the egg cells pollination process

203
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,949
something you may want to review and be

204
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,430
familiar with for the quiz coming up on

205
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,430
