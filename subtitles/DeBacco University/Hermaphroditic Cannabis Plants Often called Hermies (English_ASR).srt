00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,879
in this debaco university video we'll be

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,798
going over hermaphroditic cannabis

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,679
plants and what to look for

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,920
on how to visually identify them as

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,559
being producing both a combination of

6
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,920
male

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,919
and female flowers

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,679
[Music]

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,000
as we can see in the image here we see

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,118
some definite some female structures but

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,599
we also can see

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,359
some male structures on this same plant

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,840
mixed within the same flowers

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,480
this is what we call a hermaphroditic

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,239
plant

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,839
sometimes often called hermes in the

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,839
cannabis world

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
so visually recognizing a hemorrhagic

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,840
plant is important

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,960
because they contain both male and

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,440
female

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
sex organs it's not very common at least

23
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,839
in general

24
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,839
some strains have a greater odds of

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,760
producing hermaphroditic plants

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,280
but also plants under stress may also

27
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,599
increase the odds of producing this

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,800
combination of male and female flowers

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,559
these hermaphroditic plants can

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,640
sometimes self-pollinate since both

31
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,679
pollen and ovaries will be produced on

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
the same plant

33
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,000
assuming they open in at the same time

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,118
to allow the pollen

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,959
to be received by the female plant now

36
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,280
harming out due to stress is sometimes

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,118
what

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,879
some growers will say and this is uh can

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,920
be an example of when there's heavy

40
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,679
plant damage

41
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
this can be plant damage that is

42
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
accidental or it could be induced by

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,079
heavy pruning there's also environmental

44
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,478
stresses such as water stress

45
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,840
salt stress in the root zone or simply

46
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,118
the plant becoming root bound in its

47
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
growing container

48
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,959
there's also nutrient deficiencies we

49
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,118
can also induce a stress on the plant

50
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,519
that could increase the odds of

51
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,078
producing both male and female plants

52
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,158
flowers in the same plant we want to

53
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,839
monitor our plants so when plants are

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,840
exposed to known stresses this should be

55
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
an indicator for growers to do an extra

56
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,920
scout for flower identification

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,759
indoor stress examples is making sure

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,519
the temperature doesn't get too high

59
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,879
watching our light intensities for

60
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,959
outdoor applications

61
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,319
this would be physical damage to a plant

62
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,279
that could be grower induced but it

63
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,118
could also be

64
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,718
wind damage could be physical damage due

65
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,000
to wind breaking branches or something

66
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,079
like that

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
know the genetics of some strains that

68
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,120
tend to have more hermaphroditic

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
tendencies and should be removed once

70
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,080
identified

71
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
to avoid the chance of causing that

72
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,920
pollination to occur

73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,360
lastly what are you actually looking for

74
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,280
well you want to look at both the buds

75
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,760
and palm sacs the same plant

76
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,039
sometimes within the same flower cluster

77
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,280
we can see that right here we see a

78
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,919
definite strong

79
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,199
female plant identification but we also

80
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,518
see that pollen sac

81
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,518
also develop in here within that plant

82
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,319
this is an example of hermaphroditic

83
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,920
flower

84
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,839
so hopefully this allows you to kind of

85
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,679
get a developing understanding of just

86
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
what a hermaphroditic plant is

87
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,040
and what to visually look for within

88
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,039
your own plants
