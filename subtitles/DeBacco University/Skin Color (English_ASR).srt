1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
okay this videos gonna look at skin

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,599
color and what kind of makes up the

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,660
pigmentation for the different skin

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,399
colors that we see depicted here so

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,990
looking first at skin color in the

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,509
pigments there's three main ones we want

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,460
to focus on first one is melanin and

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,410
this is the most important provides UV

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,269
protection now there's a delicate

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,250
balance between being protected from UV

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,829
light and being able to synthesize

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,140
vitamin D I have a separate video that

13
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:31,439
handles all light vs vitamin D my

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,750
welcome to check that out the second

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,840
type of skin pigment is keratin this is

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,659
provided from our diet carrots yellow

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,940
vegetables tomatoes these have a lot of

18
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,669
keratin in them carrots for example

19
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:45,738
beta-carotene you may have heard of

20
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,899
hemoglobins the last one it's the pink

21
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:51,659
of light-skinned Caucasian skin contains

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,070
little melanin and it's actually some of

23
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,339
the haemoglobin that's coming through

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,980
that's giving the skin its color or

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,480
appearance now we're looking at map of

26
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,839
the world here and we could see

27
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,069
different regions of the world tie in

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,850
with the skin color

29
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,649
well those areas that tend to be higher

30
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:12,899
intensities of sun where there's a large

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,540
population to have darker skin colors

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,520
than at the North Pole for example here

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,680
whether you tends to be less intense

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,629
sunlight so we could see if there's

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,540
definitely correlation here particularly

36
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:27,539
in Africa and Australia with the skin

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,729
tone the chromatic scale and the

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,659
relation to the equator or the intensity

39
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:35,368
of Sun reading this has a genetic and

40
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,469
things and we're looking at skin color

41
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:39,150
is genetic the intensity of the pigment

42
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,368
is based on the amount of melanin and

43
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,590
that's genetically controlled light

44
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,810
colored skin do the connective tissue in

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,020
hemoglobin giving it its light color and

46
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,149
we saw before geographic location and

47
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:53,009
has a set amount of UV radiation which

48
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,439
correlates with the indigenous skin

49
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,069
pigment in c-average skin pigment for

50
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,589
that region

51
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:01,438
I did say skin color is genetic which is

52
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,368
true we see that evident here where we

53
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:07,859
have a homozygous basically recessive

54
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:10,288
for all of the color genes here light

55
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,509
and then almost I guess down here for a

56
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,949
very dark and if yet are heterozygotes

57
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:16,439
here we breed those here

58
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:19,439
f2 generation and we get this kind of

59
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,300
effect here most out of resulting from

60
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,030
this cross will be kind of that medium

61
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,000
in this case a scale of three skin color

62
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,250
as there will be very as rare as number

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,090
six here and you see it kind of also

64
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,848
depicted here in a Punnett square like

65
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,739
for a high hybrid cross so again it's

66
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:41,729
genetic we kinda have the ideas here but

67
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:45,360
with the geographic location being an

68
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:49,979
influence on selecting for one skin type

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,810
or one pigmentation versus another so a

70
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,090
little comparison between what we see

71
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,079
the macroscopic view in the microscopic

72
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:01,379
view so the Photoshop 40 X magnification

73
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:02,730
and Caucasian skin here is a and may not

74
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,639
be able to see it here but these locator

75
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:08,219
is this is a microscopic version of the

76
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:11,479
skin and we see see here for East

77
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:14,129
Indians and then D is located here

78
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,289
ESO came here for african-americans and

79
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,750
then F here so if you're looking one of

80
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:20,189
these letters are located the B the D

81
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,840
and the F might be a little hard to pick

82
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:23,669
out initially if you note the

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,030
progression increase of melanin as skin

84
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:29,458
pigment darkens as is you check the

85
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,780
links here courtesy of someone who was

86
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,700
able to provide these pictures online

87
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,459
than that music here to show you guys

88
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,409
how the what we're noticing is the

89
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,549
melanin or pigmentation is darkening as

90
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:44,219
our skin color is darkening so what

91
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,260
provides this well the melanocyte

92
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:49,079
location this is what's producing the

93
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,578
actual melanin melanin production so

94
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,650
here's our skin this will kind of

95
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,569
towards the upper surface here we have

96
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,700
the dermis and dermal layers if we zoom

97
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:59,818
in that box it looks like this and this

98
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:03,328
is our specific zoom aid of the local on

99
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:05,879
the site can't hide altogether

100
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,920
i'm here's our milan site down here this

101
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,259
would be dark skin on the left and light

102
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,168
skin on the right and we notice that

103
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:16,519
there's a lot of these Malena somes that

104
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:18,989
are dark so melanin is the pigmentation

105
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,209
and these cells contain a lot of that

106
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,500
mess tends to be the darker skin here

107
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,500
the lighter skin we see a lot of those

108
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,269
basically left white or blank they don't

109
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,509
have that pigmentation and that will

110
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,310
show

111
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:31,230
ultimately as lighter skin allowing

112
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,839
hemoglobin and connective tissue to show

113
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,120
through here with our intense melanin

114
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,459
gritting that darker skin appearance

115
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,139
their few minuses our high epidermis

116
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,839
here this is the skin cells that will be

117
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,719
kind of leading off and getting broken

118
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,159
off and being shed and this is our layer

119
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,530
down here that's working its progression

120
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,360
up here hopefully this provides a little

121
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:54,529
bit of a background on the pigmentation

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,530
of different skin color
