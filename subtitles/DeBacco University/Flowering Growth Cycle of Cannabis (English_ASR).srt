1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
thank you for a look at flowering growth

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,660
cycle of cannabis and we could see in

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,300
the picture here that initial kind of

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,699
female flower is starting to be produced

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,320
at the apical meristem of this branch

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:15,239
there we're gonna let see just a little

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,310
bit more about this growth cycle that

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,109
the plant goes through so flowering

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,089
first is induced by an even 12 hours of

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,680
light you twelve hours of dark the key

11
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,800
remembers those twelve hours of

12
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,480
continuous darkness after the change

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,580
plants will show visible response in

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,000
under two weeks so once you kind of go

15
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:35,219
from those 1618 plus hours of light to

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,780
twelve hours of light and dark after

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,550
this change that's we're gonna start to

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,890
see that within about two weeks time

19
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,019
there's flowers development this mimics

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,308
the fall season where Knights begin to

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,980
get longer which is typically when

22
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:50,189
plants want to begin to prepare flowers

23
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,558
to carry on for the next generation now

24
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:53,820
as a plant prepares for fall time New

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,530
England we have the leaves that turn

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,409
different colors indicated by that

27
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,109
shortening days for canvas the

28
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:03,419
vegetative part or phase the plant will

29
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,978
begin to slow it will still grow maize

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,079
stems may still stretch and leaves may

31
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,629
still grow but they may produce less

32
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,519
blades and typically that it hit of

33
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,438
course will be slowed for sure this is

34
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,509
when plants are needing less nitrogen in

35
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,489
their fertilizer program which is where

36
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,079
bloom fertilizers come in bloom furrows

37
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,509
are typically higher in phosphorous

38
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,228
which can be come integrated to

39
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,759
encourage flower production into your

40
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:28,438
nutrient reservoir during the flowering

41
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,509
stage is when most of the cannabinoid

42
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,188
interpreting production will occur so

43
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,719
keep that in mind this is considered

44
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:35,758
flower rooms are often considered the

45
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,978
money room even though it is important

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,618
to set your plants up well in it through

47
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,700
the vegetative stage

48
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:43,200
remember your chosen cultivars of

49
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,180
cannabis ruderalis will flower

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,430
automatically in about three or four ish

51
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,829
weeks of growth regardless of the photo

52
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,840
period there's some late blooming sativa

53
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:53,398
varieties that may need special care so

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,290
again just knowing your cultivar that

55
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,879
you've chosen to grow and all the pros

56
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,009
and cons associated with that ahead of

57
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,009
time will be best for your operation
