1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
so here gonna give you some details

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,469
about metal-halide grow lights deviated

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:09,989
mhm keep in mind these are not the same

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:13,048
as ceramic metal halides do just your

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,298
plain old metal k lines these are being

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:18,210
used less and less it seems like as the

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,800
years go on metal headlights are

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,480
available in a wide variety of water it

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,939
is six and thousand Watts being the most

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,829
common each one it has a suggested gross

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,349
base typically eight thousand watts it's

12
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:30,778
covering about a 5x5 area that's six

13
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,460
hundred about a 4x4 area bulbs can

14
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:33,719
differ by manufacturer but if you see a

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,980
super bulb

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,510
it'll be brighter than a standard bulb

17
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:41,369
while commonly rated with a life of

18
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:43,199
about nine thousand hours most growers

19
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:44,159
who have placed bulbs after six to

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,809
twelve months

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,569
keep in mind when you are changing out

22
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:51,179
your middle key light bulbs to dispose

23
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,920
of them properly because of some of the

24
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,229
contents that they have can be

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,399
considered toxic so we want to make sure

26
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,608
just not throwing them out we're

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,350
disposing of them properly typically

28
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,480
recommend for the vegetative stage of

29
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,728
growth these metal halides phase due to

30
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,709
the increased amount of blue light to

31
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,769
keep the internode distance minimal

32
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:13,259
implants this can also have good canopy

33
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,359
penetration but often requires cooling

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,469
that internode distance that prevents

35
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,989
plants from stretching and getting

36
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,989
really leggy so this is why metal

37
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:25,609
halides are typically using the

38
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:25,609
vegetative phase of growth
