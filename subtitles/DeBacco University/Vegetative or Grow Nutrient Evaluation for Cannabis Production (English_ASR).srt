00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
if you're looking at some vegetative or

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,200
grow nutrients here on this tobacco

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,559
university video

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,480
i'll provide you just kind of an example

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:16,910
and go through some of the fertilizers

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:19,920
you might be considering

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,519
[Music]

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,439
all right let's get into vegetative or

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,800
grow nutrient evaluation for cannabis

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,240
production

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,839
and keep in mind that i'm not sponsored

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,358
by any of these companies but these are

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,799
just kind of a general review

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:36,160
botanicare very common name the tanacare

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,640
pureblend pro grow 3 2

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,319
4 fertilizer blend essential elements

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,600
are not derived from urea or ammonium

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
nitrates that's something to take into

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,879
consideration

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,799
the organic components of pureblend pro

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,519
enhance uptake and utilization of plant

22
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,159
nutrients

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,320
at least according to the company an

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,759
amplified metabolic rate and capacity

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,679
enables plants to produce

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,799
fruits and vegetables with more minerals

27
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,558
and vitamins

28
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,718
again another statement from the company

29
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,039
here but this is a very common

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,640
grow nutrient blend that many growers

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,320
may choose to utilize

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,000
but then there is also the general

33
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,359
organics so this

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,879
is a general hydroponics i should say

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,200
floral nutrients seven

36
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,399
four ten be aware of the high potassium

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,400
ratio in this fertilizer so if you're

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,520
fertilizing for the grow in particularly

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,280
you're gonna be looking at the nitrogen

40
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,039
number and that's important but keep in

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,640
mind this also has a relatively high

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,159
potassium number so take that into

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,079
consideration when you're going through

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,439
and fertilizing your plants

45
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,359
then we have fox farm here this is a

46
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,118
fox farm grow big liquid concentrate

47
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,959
it's a 644 blend

48
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,959
manufacturer recommendations are all

49
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,118
stated here general feeding heavy

50
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,399
feeding and foliar feeding as well

51
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,239
keep in mind if you are going to do

52
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,439
foliar feeding with any fertilizer not

53
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,199
just this one

54
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,719
you want to apply it to both sides of

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,399
the leaves and you don't want to apply

56
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,118
it to plants that are in direct sunlight

57
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,920
because that could

58
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,719
increase the chance of damage so here we

59
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,079
have our

60
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,920
general feeding of two to three

61
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,718
teaspoons heavy feeding of four

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,960
teaspoons

63
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,118
again generally follow the recommended

64
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,399
recommendations don't go above because

65
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,840
feeding your plants more

66
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,159
will not necessarily make them grow any

67
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,800
better they have

68
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,159
npk industries so they get their name

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
from the nitrogen phosphorus and

70
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,318
potassium listed in fertilizers

71
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,159
they have a raw veg a a raw edge b we

72
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,919
can see different ratios listed here

73
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,280
they have a feeding schedule here as

74
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,119
well all these

75
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
products are water soluble forms meaning

76
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
they're a powder that you'll add to

77
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,520
water

78
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,560
while the company recommends equal parts

79
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,480
realize that there

80
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,080
are concentration differences in these

81
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,639
fertilizers the advantages

82
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
you can potentially make modifications

83
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,679
to match

84
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,598
your particular growing situation and

85
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,439
then lastly we have advanced nutrients

86
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,119
which specifically targets the cannabis

87
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,239
industry in their marketing and kind of

88
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,080
all their research

89
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,759
there is a great focus on ph balanced

90
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,280
nutrient lines particularly for

91
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,719
hydroponic production

92
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,959
however keep in mind with advanced

93
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,080
nutrients the products often carry a

94
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
premium cost

95
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,000
compared to other nutrients so again

96
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,200
take that into consideration

97
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,800
that when you're looking at applying

98
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,479
nutrients you want to be also

99
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
considerate of the cost

100
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,759
that you're going to incur for the

101
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,959
plants that you'll be fertilizing

102
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,639
hopefully this gives you just a couple

103
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,039
companies to kind of look at or consider

104
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,318
or compare again not sponsored by anyone

105
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,158
but just here to provide you with a

106
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,919
little bit of some ideas

107
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,359
for nutrients you might want to consider

108
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,799
during the vegetative

109
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,800
cycle of your plants
