1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
here we're learning about calculating

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,479
average atomic mass so grab your

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,080
calculators and play our home game on

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,880
calculating average atomic mass so first

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,949
off what is average atomic mass well

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,740
average atomic mass is based on what we

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:18,989
call a weighted average of the isotopes

8
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:22,229
that exist for an element keep in mind

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:25,169
isotopes refers to atoms that have

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,599
different amounts of neutrons it's a

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,730
weighted average meaning we're taking

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,009
into account certain percentages it's

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,630
not just a straight add up by the total

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,119
number that you have and divided by that

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,920
number the number expressed as we see

16
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,878
here for iron fifty five point eight

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,789
five on the periodic table this number

18
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,920
is expressed even though there is not an

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,808
isotope of the element it actually has

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,448
mass stated on the table

21
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:53,218
so no isotope really has a mass of fifty

22
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:55,259
five point eight five even though that's

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,000
the number we use if you think about

24
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:01,679
this related to grades when you use s as

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,750
an example you may your average in on

26
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,728
the report card may not represent any

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,219
single one grade that you've gotten or

28
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,260
received but that is stated as your

29
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,359
average would be an example of a

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,930
weighted average so let's take this to

31
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,489
the example looking at grades so why not

32
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,229
just divide by the sum of the total

33
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:20,849
number this is because this is a

34
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:23,519
weighted average so the percent

35
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:25,739
abundance takes into it is taken into

36
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,658
account that an isotope that may have a

37
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,478
greater percentage will have a greater

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,469
influence on that average so then you

39
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,420
probably know when this doesn't really

40
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:34,618
make a whole lot of sense so it's really

41
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,200
something you probably bit more

42
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,400
concerned about was grades

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,950
think of it as a grade average where

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,618
quizzes count less or a smaller

45
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,228
percentage than a test in this case your

46
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,299
greatest example will wait an average so

47
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:51,478
I have two examples here in this case

48
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,670
the student at the same grade on quizzes

49
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,519
same grade on homework tests lab reports

50
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,469
and projects in this example since

51
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,700
everything is equal if you notice our

52
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:02,009
percent of final grade everything is

53
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,490
weighted the same we can add up all

54
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,868
these numbers and divide by the total so

55
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:08,969
we can add all these numbers up divided

56
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:12,479
by five because there's five different

57
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:13,560
grades and get our final average pretty

58
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,359
simple

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,800
however in this case which is what we're

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,920
gonna focus on this is a weighted

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,650
average so this example of the exact

62
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,189
same grades need to count the weight of

63
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,400
each so quizzes count for 15% homework

64
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:32,879
is 10% tester 40 lab reports are 15

65
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,950
product or 20% so with those same grades

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,750
we're going to take our grade multiplied

67
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:37,979
by the percent or gonna convert this to

68
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,379
a decimal we're going to go over in a

69
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,359
second this is gonna give us a number we

70
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,879
add all of these numbers up we get the

71
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,630
average so here you can see with these

72
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:52,340
weighted average because test counts so

73
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:55,469
much and the test grade was so poor it

74
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,030
resulted in a lower final grade than

75
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:58,530
just the straight weight where's

76
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,330
everything being equal

77
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,189
so let's not relate this to a chemistry

78
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,959
example so looking here calculating

79
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:08,879
average atomic mass for boron renews

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,860
this as an example step one is to find

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,739
in natural percent abundance in the mass

82
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,930
of each isotope so here's our mass and

83
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,700
atomic mass units and here's a percent

84
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,260
abundance this information will be

85
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,609
provided to you in some way not expected

86
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:22,129
to memorize or know the percent

87
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,329
abundance for these different isotopes

88
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:25,949
keep in mind that the total percent

89
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,519
abundances should add up to 100 percent

90
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:31,409
for all possibilities so this is present

91
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,709
abundance we need to account for all the

92
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:36,120
isotopes that'd be a hundred percent so

93
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,009
now we want to convert the percent

94
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,930
abundance to a decimal and then multiply

95
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:42,030
that mass so how do we go about doing

96
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,730
this to convert the percent to a decimal

97
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,000
we divide by 100 so if we look at our

98
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:50,629
abundance we go back for one moment

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,109
19.8% and eighty-eight point two percent

100
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:58,049
are then converted to 0.198 point eight

101
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,129
zero two-thirds our example here forty

102
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,500
seven point eight percent would be

103
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:03,509
expressed as point four seven eight or

104
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,139
simply moving the decimal two places to

105
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,419
the left

106
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,059
we didn't want to multiply the mass here

107
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:12,929
at rest and atomic mass units times the

108
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,079
abundance to get a number once we have

109
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,970
these numbers we're going to go through

110
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,410
and we're going to take the sum will be

111
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,299
the average of the atomic masses would

112
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,530
be one point nine eight and add it to

113
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,259
eight point eight three

114
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:26,969
so our weighted average would be ten

115
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,039
point eight one

116
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,970
which would be the weighted average for

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,410
Warren now if you're feeling confident

118
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,910
or you want to review that again I want

119
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,850
you to calculate the average atomic mass

120
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,430
for iron and I gave you this example now

121
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,670
well the problem is in this example I

122
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,889
leave two things out one of the percent

123
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,720
abundant and one's the mass so the mass

124
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,659
is pretty easy didn't see the isotope is

125
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,680
50 for the masses 54 56 56 so this

126
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,180
question mark would be simply 57%

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,100
abundance we have to remember what I

128
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,110
said earlier these all have to add up to

129
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,340
a hundred so even though I don't give

130
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,920
you the percent or expect you to

131
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:07,019
memorize it if we add these all up and

132
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,259
subtract from 100 we can figure out that

133
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:13,979
percent as we see here step one is to

134
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:16,289
fill in the gaps 57 the isotope number

135
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,870
provided and five point eight zero

136
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,220
percent needs to be calculated by adding

137
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,569
up all the other percents and

138
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,220
subtracting from 100 continuing on step

139
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:28,529
two is to convert the percents to

140
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,420
decimals be careful

141
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,969
notice how you misspelled careful on

142
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:36,449
purpose be careful here because when we

143
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:39,870
divide by a hundred watch the placement

144
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:42,810
of the decimal points so we're lot of

145
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,639
students get tripped up here is 0.28 we

146
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,519
still have to move that decimal two

147
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,089
places to the left so that becomes point

148
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,519
zero zero two eight same here with two

149
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:56,449
point two percent we look back to point

150
00:05:53,519 --> 00:06:01,459
two percent becomes decimal two places

151
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:04,319
point zero two two non zero is our

152
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:05,370
abundance now just like we did

153
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,000
previously we're going to multiply the

154
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,699
mass by the abundance and put the number

155
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,839
in the right column here no significant

156
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,819
figures have been ignored for

157
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,139
demonstration purposes we go over

158
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:17,279
significant figures right now we're just

159
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,519
trying to get you to understand the

160
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,989
basic process so this is all of our mass

161
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,629
times abundance because it's our answers

162
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,329
again in red or just the items that were

163
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:29,850
left out in the original example we add

164
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:32,430
these all together and we have our

165
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,020
calculated weighted bass here by simply

166
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,090
adding up the weighted masses up to get

167
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,069
the average atomic mass right here this

168
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,959
would be expressed in a.m. use or atomic

169
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,819
mass unit

170
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,469
remember there's no need to divide

171
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:44,259
because the percent abundance has

172
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,940
already been taken into account to

173
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:49,340
generate our average atomic mass for

174
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,740
iron would be fifty five point nine one

175
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:53,329
one six you can look at a periodic table

176
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,550
and you may not get the exact same

177
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:57,550
answer but it should be very close
