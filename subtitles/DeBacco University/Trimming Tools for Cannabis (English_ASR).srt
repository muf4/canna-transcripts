00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,839
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:07,199
going to be looking at trimming tool

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:09,439
options for cannabis both on a manual

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,240
standpoint and also a mechanical

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,239
standpoint

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,920
and some of the pros and cons associated

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,920
with each

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,039
[Music]

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,599
all right let's get into trimming tools

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,080
for cannabis well first off trimming in

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,079
general

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,959
unlike many other plants cannabis does

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,280
require some method of kind of

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,719
singling out unpollinated buds for the

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
rest of the plant material

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,079
the process of removing the leaves near

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,799
the buds can require some detailed

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,039
trimming

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,479
if you're going for high quality dry

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,640
flour as your chosen

21
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,078
end product however there can be a lot

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,759
of plant volume

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,119
to get through so utilizing some

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,439
mechanical method

25
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,878
may be advised at least to remove some

26
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,640
of the bulk material

27
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,238
allowing for less plant material that

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,840
needs to be manually removed

29
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,679
which will improve your overall

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,280
efficiency so some will use a

31
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,759
combination of manual

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,198
methods as well as mechanized methods

33
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,079
now some will choose to use one or the

34
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,679
other

35
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,280
so if you're using hand trimming methods

36
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,040
your manual methods

37
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,439
the advantage of this is that allows

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,200
each bud to be handled in a very unique

39
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,879
way there's someone physically there

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,118
going through and taking out

41
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,039
this leaf and not that leaf or removing

42
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,719
that or trimming it in this angle

43
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,799
so that's the great part of it the

44
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,079
disadvantages is with that option is

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,200
that it is very labor

46
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,200
intensive you have to go through and be

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,799
mindful and take one section and not

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,280
another section

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
and be careful not to remove very vital

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
portions

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,319
remove those excess areas so that's why

52
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,839
some growers will go with a

53
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,919
kind of a machine trimming kind of

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,520
option as we see here a trauma version

55
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,118
it's very efficient method particularly

56
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,959
for high volume material

57
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,399
simply feed in the system here and it

58
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,078
goes through and kind of

59
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
manicured buds kind of come out the

60
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,919
other end the disadvantage

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
is that this can damage buds because it

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
is a mechanical kind of tumbling process

63
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,840
and there are other methods but

64
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,438
regardless machines do have more of that

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,399
physical contact with the buds and could

66
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,158
damage them

67
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
they also may remove too much plant

68
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,920
material because they're not

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,639
able to go through and be very precise

70
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,639
and unique with each individual bud

71
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,000
now some growers are utilizing both

72
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,679
methods where they

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,520
have a lot of plant material to process

74
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
so as a result they use a trommel or

75
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,439
some other form of mechanized system

76
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,599
might be a good first step to initially

77
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,959
trim the buds and then

78
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,719
this will remove some of the larger

79
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,439
leaves bulk material which will then

80
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,318
allow for

81
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,159
the grower to spend time doing the

82
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,719
detailed work with each unique dry

83
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,479
flower

84
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,080
so it gets the individual attention it

85
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,878
needs to look its best

86
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,800
now this is only possible kind of

87
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,239
because of the larger volumes to take

88
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,760
off some of those plant materials

89
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,840
so that the amount of individual

90
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,639
attention or the time that's spent with

91
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,800
that individual

92
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,479
tension is definitely reduced then

93
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
starting with freshly harvested plant

94
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,119
material or dried plant material

95
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,759
and starting basically to remove all the

96
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,439
leaves

97
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,840
and then go through and manicure them

98
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,560
sometimes utilization of that mechanical

99
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,560
machine

100
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,479
can be advantageous to take out some of

101
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,120
the grunt work and then allow the kind

102
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,959
of

103
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
trimmer to go through to the detailed

104
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,039
work so you're producing the highest

105
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,479
quality

106
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,479
end product possible
