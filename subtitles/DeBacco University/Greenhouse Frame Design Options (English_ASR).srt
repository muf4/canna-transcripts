1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
and we're looking at greenhouse frame

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,440
design options there's many to choose

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,750
from this one's actually an image from

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,190
the New York Botanical Gardens and while

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,740
this may look like an impressive frame

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:15,718
design structure it's rarely used in

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,390
production due to some of his

8
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:21,149
inefficiencies some more efficient

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,670
designs once called a nor'easter version

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,079
and this has a peak in the middle to

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,240
deal with snow that's common in the

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,268
Northeast United States it's a very

13
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,098
strong freestanding greenhouse structure

14
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:33,929
and it also that often has a trust

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,189
support system to offer even more

16
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:39,390
strength so this design this peak design

17
00:00:37,189 --> 00:00:41,339
ideally reduces the chance of snow

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,500
building up on top as we see on this car

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,020
so instead of it building up it can kind

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,628
of work its way and slide off that

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,420
greenhouse with hopefully minimal effort

22
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:53,718
or labor needed from the outside to help

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,059
remove that that's what it has that

24
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,510
well-defined peak in the middle when

25
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,979
it's not at the peak but is also

26
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:04,109
designed to really maximize that floor

27
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,750
space so it's called a traditional hoop

28
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:09,000
house these tend to be cheaper they're

29
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,739
very simple and easy to construct and we

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,079
could see them on the larger scale here

31
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,868
and here and also on the smaller scale

32
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,868
here that inherent curved design is very

33
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:21,090
supportive and allows the structure to

34
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:24,239
be very strong even though it's just a

35
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,710
very simple Hoopa design we have a high

36
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,319
side frame this increases the greenhouse

37
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:30,328
height to allow for increased internal

38
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,059
space it makes it easier to put benches

39
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,188
upright to the side walls in addition

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,079
this increased height creates a greater

41
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,089
distance between a very hot air to the

42
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,298
crop level so that can be advantageous

43
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,368
especially if you're growing into kind

44
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,350
of extending this season where you still

45
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:49,618
maybe have an early warmup or a late

46
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:51,750
warmup this can also help moderate those

47
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,930
temperatures at least at the crop level

48
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,368
a little bit more then there's the open

49
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,920
roof design this is the most expensive

50
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:01,799
design for greenhouses due to the

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,599
ingenuity to open the roof and you could

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,368
see you have some partially open roofs

53
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,048
here and then a full open roof here

54
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:08,788
however this is the most efficient

55
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,129
cooling method because all the hot air

56
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,259
rises so this is extra an excellent

57
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:13,799
venting area and here when they open the

58
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,959
entire

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,820
'we really efficiently allows that heat

60
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,219
to be vented out of the greenhouse very

61
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,979
quickly as a result I think this is kind

62
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,750
of the best design in the sense that

63
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,599
you're venting the hottest air you're

64
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,000
alive for great air circulation it's a

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,719
very passive system but it does require

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,719
a lot of ingenuity here and structure to

67
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,370
make it happen but again looking at a

68
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,979
permanent structure this might be worth

69
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,450
it an option considering and see if you

70
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:44,449
can justify the upfront cost
