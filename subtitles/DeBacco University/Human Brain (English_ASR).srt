1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
here we'll look at some of the regions

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,899
of the human brain and also go over some

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,820
of the very important functions that

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,888
these different regions are responsible

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,359
for so starting with the brain in

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:14,759
general it's a mess about a hundred

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,948
billion neurons located inside the skull

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,420
and hopefully your brain it's a little

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,609
bit bigger than Homer Simpson's brain

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,609
does here this is where learning occurs

11
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,890
and this happens when more and stronger

12
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,830
connections are made between neurons

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,230
that are located in your brain may have

14
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:35,009
heard of left brain and right brain

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:39,359
people left brain typically referring to

16
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:41,159
those good with logic meth right brain

17
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,679
referring to those that are creative and

18
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,319
associated with the arts this may have

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,058
some truth behind it but there's a lot

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,390
of interconnections that occur between

21
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,369
both your left and right brain

22
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,590
continuing on eart tells Cephalon is a

23
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,299
region of the brain is devoted largely

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,989
to associative activity

25
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:02,849
the cerebrum or the cerebrum it's about

26
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:05,039
eighty-five percent of the weight of the

27
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,750
human brain located here in red and

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,240
highlighted so you can have an idea of

29
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,579
just how large it is and also where it's

30
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,709
located this is the dominant part of the

31
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:17,429
brain and receives sensory data and

32
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:20,280
issues motor commands the cerebral

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,290
cortex is the great outer layer hid in

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,359
this region functions in language

35
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:30,118
thought personality and other thinking

36
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:32,519
and feeling activities this cerebrum is

37
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,859
also the largest part of the human brain

38
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,658
now while it may be divided in different

39
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,790
regions as we see here such as the

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,009
frontal lobe the temporal lobe the

41
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,299
parental lobe and the occipital lobe all

42
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,250
these are composed or all these together

43
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,530
make up the cerebrum

44
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,060
this is repo-man all these different

45
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,489
lobes are responsible for thought

46
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,368
language senses memory and voluntary

47
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,839
movement continuing on we have the

48
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:01,500
cerebellum and this is at the base of

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,118
the brain located in red here well it

50
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,700
may be a little bit smaller in nature

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,550
than the cerebrum we just talked about

52
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,000
is responsible for muscle coordination

53
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,469
balance and posture all things that are

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,020
very vital

55
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,669
to our day-to-day lives this is a

56
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,230
cross-section of how it looks you can

57
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,539
see a lot of folds located in this

58
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:24,419
region and sometimes you may have heard

59
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:26,929
hear it referred to as the hindbrain but

60
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:29,819
will refer to as the cerebellum

61
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,140
continuing aadmi of the brainstem this

62
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,419
connects the brain to the spinal cord

63
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,129
which sounds pretty easy the brainstem

64
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,819
can explain the spinal cord

65
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:41,849
however the brainstem itself also has

66
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:43,889
some very important responsibilities and

67
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,289
highlighted here in red this region is

68
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:48,539
responsible for monitoring and keeping

69
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:50,909
us breathing our swallowing our

70
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:53,909
digestion our heartbeat and also

71
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:58,099
monitoring maintaining a healthy blood

72
00:02:53,909 --> 00:03:01,259
pressure continuing on we have the

73
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:03,689
Dianna's Cephalon region this is

74
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:05,699
composed of the thalamus which is the

75
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:08,699
relay center between incoming sensory

76
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:10,560
information and the cerebrum in the

77
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,439
hypothalamus which coordinates nervous

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,939
and hormonal responses to many internal

79
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,209
stimuli such as body temperature and

80
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,370
blood pressure so on and so forth also

81
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:22,530
emotions controls pituitary brilliant

82
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,769
and it's secretion so we see here's our

83
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,259
thalamus here's our hypothalamus located

84
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:31,469
here and some direct relation to the

85
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:33,030
pituitary gland so there's a right

86
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:36,599
thalamus and a left thalamus and

87
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:39,989
hypothalamus all these different regions

88
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,389
here are performing very important

89
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,530
functions to help us maintain

90
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,048
homeostasis

91
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,030
let me see it's okay just about bets and

92
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:50,489
our portion you see these the skull here

93
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,409
rotates and that red referring to where

94
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:53,909
that thalamus is we see where the

95
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:55,349
thalamus is that head without muscles

96
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:58,319
located right in the frontal region

97
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:59,729
there just to give you the anatomy of

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,709
the brain there's these three room

99
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:04,250
there's the cerebellum and there's our

100
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,250
brainstem
