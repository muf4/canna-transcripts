1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
so understanding the reproductive

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,459
strategy of plants is important we're

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,619
going to look at a couple different ways

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,690
and see how they relate to cannabis in

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,638
particular and what makes that plant

6
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:15,149
unique or different than some other

7
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:17,399
plant species so there's two main types

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,980
of reproductive strategies there's -

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:23,070
which are male and female reproductive

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,630
organs produced on the same plan this is

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,439
common in oak trees corn and squash

12
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:27,599
plants

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,300
there's diabetes where a plant only

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,299
produces male or female reproductive

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,120
organs this is found in Kinkos asparagus

16
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,549
and also cannabis regardless of the

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,359
reproductive strategy the end goal is to

18
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:44,488
produce viable seeds so look at the -

19
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,829
are hermaphrodites is sometimes referred

20
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:50,070
to these are plants with both male and

21
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,719
female flowers this limits the travel

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,659
distance for pollen and can help Wow for

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,850
a few individuals to populate an area so

24
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,009
this - we see a male flower and a female

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,020
flower this is the male flower here

26
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,698
produces the pollen this is the female

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,379
flower that's producing in this case the

28
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,438
small pumpkin that will grow and mature

29
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,969
and have the seeds in it - is plants

30
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,769
though this reproductive strategy

31
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,469
requires transfer of pollen from one

32
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,329
individual to another here we have a

33
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,789
male plant this plan will only produce

34
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:21,569
male flowers this is a female plant or

35
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,390
only produce female flowers as a result

36
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:25,949
the genetic variability will increase so

37
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,070
if we had a separate plant producing

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,450
pollen and a separate plant producing

39
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:32,819
female portions they would need to

40
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,520
transfer that pollen over which we know

41
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,578
increase the mobility for this

42
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,298
particular species that I should plant

43
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:44,339
for example cannabis produces male or

44
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:46,290
female plants not and it's or female

45
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,960
plants the male plants only produce

46
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,600
pollen and the female plants only

47
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,780
produce buds or seeds upon successful

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,599
pollination so where cannabis seeds come

49
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,790
from or Hema seeds come from seeds are

50
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,030
result of a successful pollination what

51
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,100
does that mean well the pollination is

52
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,590
pollen fertilizing an ovum or an egg

53
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,118
that will result in a seed the

54
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,039
production of seeds requires the plant

55
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,439
to devote most of its energy to the next

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,189
generation as seeds require energy

57
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:21,150
orange protective seed coat and a whole

58
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:23,159
bunch of other things now how does see

59
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,590
this cannabis produced how is this

60
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,930
possible well kind of no major secret

61
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,330
these the whole goal is to grow a female

62
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,439
plant and simply do not allow polymer

63
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,030
come in contact with it

64
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,590
but that could be burning a flower here

65
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,569
and not allowing to be in this case to

66
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,200
come in contact with it here we see a

67
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:43,650
research plot here and we see the bags

68
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:46,199
over all of these flower structures this

69
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,480
would be eliminating pollen transfer or

70
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,789
allowing the specific crosses to be made

71
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,799
so houston the scale is produced well

72
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:54,449
it's quite simple you just prevent

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,620
pollen from coming in contact with the

74
00:02:54,449 --> 00:03:00,869
female flower reason why most growers

75
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,689
are only growing male early grand

76
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,520
females and males are discarded his

77
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,129
nails will not yield buds that will

78
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,719
produce much in the way of cannabinoids

79
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:12,479
so value of male plants and blood

80
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:15,960
production is basically zero growing

81
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,369
males is more important for breeders but

82
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,709
not for people looking to produce

83
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,750
cannabinoids male plants should be

84
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,969
identified early and discarded since

85
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,469
they do not yield much in their pollen

86
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:28,199
could jeopardise female plants from

87
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,939
producing quality buds quality bud in

88
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:33,030
having a plant produced higher

89
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:35,099
cannabinoids if it's producing seeds its

90
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,489
its cannabinoid production will suffer

91
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,709
the only value for males is for breeders

92
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,379
for their pollen to create viable seeds

93
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,530
to produce genetic variation or grow

94
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:49,079
more plants but for most people males

95
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,719
are simply discarded as soon as they can

96
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,209
be identified because their quality or

97
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:58,009
cannabinoid production is quite poor in

98
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,009
comparison to female plants
