1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,839
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,639
video here looking at

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,599
soil's importance in forensic science so

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,879
something we may not

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,959
necessarily always take into

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,040
consideration particularly for outdoor

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,080
sites but can also sometimes apply to

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,278
indoor sites

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,198
is the understanding of soil

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,039
so first off figure i should define what

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,600
soil basically is and it's the upper

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,039
layer

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,039
of the earth where plants grown is

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,400
composed of a mixture of minerals

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,118
water grasses and organic decaying

16
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,039
remains rocks are broken down and mixed

17
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,238
with organic materials from living

18
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,479
organisms

19
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,759
so here we see the earthworm here in the

20
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,000
top of the soil

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,679
initially on a quick look all soil may

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,520
look to be the same

23
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,119
but there's actually key and distinctive

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
differences

25
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,679
so when we're looking at forensic

26
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,439
science in particular we're looking at

27
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,519
where we're going to find this

28
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,280
a lot of times we're inspecting footwear

29
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,079
or tires for example

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
where soil can get lodged in the tread

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,119
so this can help

32
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,640
establish the likelihood that a person

33
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,158
or object was present at the

34
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,840
scene of the crime so just finding soil

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,840
is one thing but now identifying or

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,799
potentially matching that soil up to a

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,920
crime scene

38
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,118
is the next step so when we're looking

39
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
at that soil

40
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,359
as far as a detail goes there are

41
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,639
different types of soils we're looking

42
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,000
at sandy soils

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,478
they have high porosity they have a

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,560
relatively large particle size

45
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,319
gravel would be the largest as we see

46
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,040
over uh over in this direction

47
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,239
sand is also quite large water drains

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,680
very quickly through that you can think

49
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,920
of the beach you watch a

50
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
wave come over a sandy beach and water

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,960
drains right through it

52
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,879
then we have silt soil and this is like

53
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,519
mid-sized particles and they may be

54
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,359
saying

55
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,798
that's a pretty big jump from sand to

56
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,280
silt and the image and

57
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,118
while it is clay is even smaller but

58
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,640
that silt being that mid size

59
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,640
it's favorable for water holding

60
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,118
supporting plant growth typically a lot

61
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,239
of

62
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,118
farmers type related soils have a good

63
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,759
percentage of

64
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,560
silt in them then lastly we have clay

65
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
which is uh

66
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,799
has very small spaces it's very very

67
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,560
fine particles

68
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,719
and because of that those particles tend

69
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,959
to fold and kind of lay together

70
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,758
almost looks like a folding of a pages

71
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,039
of a book here

72
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,958
where they're kind of like stacking on

73
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,559
top of one another

74
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,080
and we can see that evident here and

75
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,479
that's what tends to be so

76
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,560
fine tends to get almost like a sticky

77
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,959
like consistency

78
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
when we're inspecting a sample of soil

79
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,520
on a visual

80
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,200
basis uh this can be used a microscope

81
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,280
we want to dry the sample and observe

82
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,479
the color of that soil once dry

83
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
we look at the particles that are

84
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,759
present when we remove any trace

85
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,360
evidence that we may find this could be

86
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,759
fibers glass or hair

87
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,560
and compare observations with control

88
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,959
samples

89
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,239
or comparison of samples of crime scene

90
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,598
to suspected

91
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,360
or potential crime scenes there

92
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,280
now we have chemical composition of soil

93
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
samples so taking it one step further

94
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,199
than just the

95
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,080
visible means looking at what is the

96
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,318
chemical

97
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
makeup of that soil so using a

98
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,679
microscope

99
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
you want to take a subsample and a small

100
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
drop of

101
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,599
hydrochloric acid the goal there is to

102
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,759
see

103
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,959
if one's added to the soil if bubbles

104
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,158
are formed

105
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,239
i could also see if there's a color

106
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,000
change in the soil if you notice bubbles

107
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,560
that's the present of carbonates such as

108
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
chalk or

109
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,318
limestone and that can be an indication

110
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,439
of some of the chemical composition of

111
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,119
the soil

112
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,199
there's a yellow color that indicates

113
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,039
the presence of iron

114
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,479
so some soils tend to be a little bit

115
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,919
higher in iron and it's going to be one

116
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,439
way of determining that

117
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,518
i want to confirm the presence of iron

118
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,158
by adding a few drops of potassium

119
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,560
ferrous

120
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,560
cyanide and this is an observing green

121
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,280
color in that sample and this will help

122
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
you determine with a very small soil

123
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,840
sample

124
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,799
whether or not iron is present which can

125
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,400
help classify a soil

126
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,080
another way to classify soils looking at

127
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,599
the organic matter so if you have any

128
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,080
gardens a lot of people look at

129
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,878
what the organic matter is in their soil

130
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,719
it's prefer

131
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,158
performed by what's called an ignition

132
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,239
test where you dry the sample

133
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,878
you weigh it you heat the sample to a

134
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,759
very high amount of heat 750 to 800

135
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,759
degrees celsius

136
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,878
for about an hour then you allow it to

137
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,639
cool and you re-weigh it

138
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,239
and you will calculate the percentage of

139
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,479
loss on ignition you're essentially

140
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,680
burning off some of the components

141
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,719
particularly the organic

142
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,319
components of that soil and being left

143
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,000
only with the minerals

144
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,159
and this can really help determine or

145
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,600
classify a soil is for example

146
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,840
on the extreme case if someone walked

147
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,520
through a potential compost pile

148
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,119
looking at a very high organic matter

149
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,079
and that could be a way to classify

150
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,478
or identify that particular soil type

151
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,199
there's

152
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,519
also soils ph which if you're looking at

153
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,199
growing plants something very important

154
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,439
also knowing the ph this can provide a

155
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
general idea of two soils if there could

156
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,000
be a match

157
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,519
we're having one it's really acidic or

158
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,519
really basic uh

159
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,719
is there a potential on that they match

160
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,120
or is it neutral is it an

161
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
odd soil ph potentially did it have

162
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
limestone added to it

163
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,639
or did it have potash added to it that

164
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,840
can vastly affect

165
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,600
the soil ph compared to the native soil

166
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,679
particle size distributions this is

167
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,479
referring to how much percentage of clay

168
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,199
silt sand and gravel is present in the

169
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,279
soil

170
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,560
this can involve the set of sieves to

171
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,079
separate the particle based on their

172
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,038
size and calculate the weights

173
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,758
and percentage of each size just another

174
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,439
factor another way we can help classify

175
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,759
that soil to get a little bit more

176
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,279
specific

177
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,439
soil changes in different regions so

178
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,319
again keep in mind that soil can change

179
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,719
in small

180
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,478
sections or in an area and this could be

181
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,759
in where there might be plant material

182
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,279
this could be the area where

183
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,280
there's certain plants growing what the

184
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,719
land might land might be used for

185
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,319
so all these to be taken into

186
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,440
consideration and the soil sample should

187
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,879
be taken as close

188
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,120
to the suspected area where it was

189
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,240
picked up on the tire tread or

190
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,399
on the shoe as possible

191
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,680
the whole point on the goal of this kind

192
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,959
of soil

193
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,800
investigation is to provide increased

194
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,399
lengths so it's very common in hit and

195
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,199
run accidents automotive accidents

196
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,599
burglaries

197
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,280
outdoor scenes in general so using the

198
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,680
visual and chemical methods the goals

199
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,399
establish links from the recovered and

200
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,600
standard

201
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:10,719
soil sample which are very important

202
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,720
in the great scheme of forensic science
