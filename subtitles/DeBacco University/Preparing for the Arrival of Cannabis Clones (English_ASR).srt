00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
here in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,200
i'm going to go over how you would go

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
about preparing for the arrival of

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,919
cannabis clones

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,320
while this image shows an outdoor

6
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:16,849
application this can also apply to

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:20,000
indoor grows as well

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,080
[Music]

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,679
all right let's go over how to prepare

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,198
for the arrival of cannabis clones that

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,719
you might be receiving

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,240
so first off you want to prepare for the

13
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,759
arrival of the cleanse how do you go

14
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,598
about doing this

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,800
you may not need to have a full

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,119
propagation environment

17
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,839
the exact day of arrival implanting day

18
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,439
will likely

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
not be a perfect match so there's going

20
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,799
to be a slight difference here

21
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,878
as a result growers need to have an area

22
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,718
to be ready to receive the clones

23
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,718
that is supportive for their growth and

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,719
at least kind of easing that transition

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
process again while we're seeing some

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,640
outdoor preparations here

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
this also applies to someone who might

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,120
be using clones for an

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,079
indoor operation because the clones

30
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,759
often arrived

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,600
stress so this is important factor to

32
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,960
keep in mind even the best companies

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,320
that ship them or even if they come in

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,159
and purchase them locally

35
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,679
they're going to be a little stressed

36
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,640
they typically arrive on site with some

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,479
degree of stress

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,879
and that could be light stress water

39
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:13,920
stress temperature or any combination of

40
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,759
the above factor

41
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,600
so growers need to create a kind of a

42
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,759
nursing environment to actually

43
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,519
allow your newly arrived clones to

44
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,519
adjust to an area before

45
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,280
they go to the main growing area clones

46
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,000
are typically exposed to long hours of

47
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,599
darkness

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,438
so exposing plants to proper photo

49
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,118
period is also important

50
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,319
now we could see here these clones are

51
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,200
going to be prepared for an outdoor

52
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,359
operation

53
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,880
but they were put outside under a tree

54
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,159
in the very early morning you can tell

55
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,719
by that by this

56
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
very uh sun angle that we see there it's

57
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,959
not directly above them

58
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,600
just kind of in the morning they're

59
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,000
helping them adjust to that outside

60
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,599
uh light the natural sunlight but not

61
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,640
blazing high noon

62
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,158
bright sun the old goal overall here as

63
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,599
we see is to keep the intensity

64
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,040
initially a little bit lower

65
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,640
but increase the plants as they get

66
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,159
accustomed to their new environment

67
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,680
if you're an indoor grower that could be

68
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,439
putting shade netting up or if you have

69
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,600
a dimmable option on your lights

70
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,118
turning them down until they're dimmed

71
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,519
so that your plants aren't getting that

72
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:09,439
full

73
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,199
par reading at least right when they get

74
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,759
to your location

75
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,199
now your goal as a grower if it's a pot

76
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,560
of arrival your crohn's should try to

77
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,238
for your clones you should try to

78
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
stabilize the environment that the

79
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,878
clones are being exposed to

80
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,039
you don't want to keep going through

81
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,639
constant changes while you want to have

82
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,878
it match the conditions they will be

83
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,479
experiencing at the vegetative cycle

84
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,399
you may have to work the plants up to

85
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,679
that level of stress and that could be

86
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,159
light stress water stress temperature

87
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
stress

88
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,079
all those above included so i want to

89
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,840
slowly get them to

90
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
that area that they're going to be

91
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,239
spending their vegetative propagation

92
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,680
portion of their life cycle now

93
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,878
depending on the duration depending on

94
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
how long you need to

95
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,959
stage or hold your clones before they

96
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
reach their final planting site will

97
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,519
impact

98
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,840
the care and attention that they will

99
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,959
need the longer the duration the more

100
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,519
careful

101
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,039
care and attention needs to be given but

102
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,599
keep in mind while you're giving that

103
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,359
care and

104
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,280
attention while you're holding them keep

105
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
in mind you want to make sure that

106
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,000
you're having that environment

107
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,518
represent where they're going to go to

108
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,800
next you don't want to have them go

109
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,080
through a massive change

110
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,719
you want to try to replicate that

111
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,879
environment as best that you can

112
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,479
now when you're holding clones the goal

113
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,000
is to keep them alive and healthy but

114
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,598
not really make them grow all that

115
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
much particularly if they're going

116
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,560
outdoors and you have to hold them

117
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,680
indoors for a period of time

118
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
you just want to keep them alive you

119
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
don't want to grow crazy or stretch or

120
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,640
cause any sorts of other issues

121
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
a lot of growers get their clones in

122
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,359
they're excited their plants you don't

123
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
really want to push a lot of growth

124
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,200
because that can cause stress to the

125
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,479
plants often they'll have a limited

126
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,238
rooting system

127
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,679
and they're going to be transplanted so

128
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,120
they're going to get disturbed again

129
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,959
so you just kind of want to hold them in

130
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,480
that nice healthy state

131
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,759
before they get to their final

132
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,719
environment don't try to push a bunch of

133
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,598
growth and think you're going to get a

134
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,560
big head start

135
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,439
before they transition to the last spot

136
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,199
if you're holding clothes for an

137
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,239
extended period of time this isn't just

138
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,359
an important note

139
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,560
your timing is a little bit off you want

140
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,920
to be sure that

141
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,598
when they're being transferred to their

142
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,359
final growing environment you may need

143
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,798
to transplant the clones to allow the

144
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,400
roots to expand

145
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,400
so keep in mind that when you're looking

146
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,360
at that longer duration if your timing

147
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
is a little bit off

148
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,640
you may have to up pot them before they

149
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,719
get transplanted

150
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,798
now this can be a time consuming process

151
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,399
so it's best really to time the delivery

152
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,319
so you do not need to hold clones for

153
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,159
extended period of time and up pot them

154
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,000
but in some cases you may need to do

155
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,880
this and it might be advantageous for

156
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,040
you to do that

157
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,560
if your timing isn't quite right there

158
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,000
because sometimes the clones come in

159
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,639
when the clones come in and you might

160
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,040
have issues with your final site or

161
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,560
preparation time this is a viable option

162
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,759
to ensure when those clones do go out to

163
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,959
their final location

164
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,280
they're going to be in the best shape

165
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,478
possible and hopefully produce the best

166
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,079
quality plants

167
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,879
for the duration of the growing season

168
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,879
for you
