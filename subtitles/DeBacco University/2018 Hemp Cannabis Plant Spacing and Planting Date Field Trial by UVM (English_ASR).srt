1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,000
when it comes to outdoor growing

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,160
oftentimes questions get asked about

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,759
how far should i space my plants what's

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,000
my ideal planting date

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,440
well here is going to be a trial looking

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,759
at hemp cannabis

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,969
uh to answer some of those questions and

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,660
we presented here on tobacco university

9
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:20,660
[Music]

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,880
so let's look at the 2018 hemp cannabis

11
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,000
plant spacing

12
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,280
in planting date field trial by uvm

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
now if you're looking to get some more

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,679
information on where this information is

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,399
pulled from

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,359
here's a link to the article and this

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,960
study by uvm

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,878
answers a lot of questions growers may

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,679
have at least provides you with some

20
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,718
research data comparisons again uvm is a

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,878
university of vermont

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,480
extension they're the original source of

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,558
this information

24
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,919
so first off well where are we talking

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,759
geographically did this

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,399
research where was this research

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,960
conducted and we could see here way up

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,239
in kind of northern vermont here almost

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,719
where kind of new york

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,399
vermont and canada all kind of come a

31
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,239
little intersection there

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,920
so keep in mind probably a little bit

33
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,000
far north compared to

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,439
some other growers but just gives you an

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,200
idea again where this was

36
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,559
where this occurred as far as the

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,159
different plant spacings

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,600
there was a one foot by one foot three

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,960
foot by three foot five foot by five

40
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,798
foot with the plant spacings

41
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,039
and here we can see the different

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,200
populations of plants per acre

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
with each of those different spacings

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
with outdoor research good to have an

45
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,920
idea of the location the previous crop

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
the planting date fertilization harvest

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,079
date

48
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,560
and here that information is provided

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,438
also with outdoor locations one of the

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,640
great variable

51
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,158
factors is the weather and here while

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,399
and it'd be a little different for your

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,079
regions it's important to know

54
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,840
that for outdoor locations the weather

55
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,639
is important to know because it can vary

56
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,960
from year to year

57
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,000
and vastly impact the data collected in

58
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,000
here while you may not be growing in

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,078
this exact location you can get an idea

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,118
what their departure from normal was for

61
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,199
average temperature

62
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,599
precipitation as well as growing degree

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,560
days of the months of june july august

64
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,679
september and

65
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,959
october then we're looking at our plant

66
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
spacing on

67
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,039
plant weight and also plant height well

68
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,280
the plants in the five foot by five foot

69
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,679
spacing had significantly greater plant

70
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
weight

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,080
compared to other spacings the average

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,878
weight was 9.11 pounds you can see that

73
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,040
right here

74
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,039
vastly different than the two other

75
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,439
spacings that were also studied

76
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,199
the plant heights relatively similar

77
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,359
across all plant spacings

78
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,878
looking at height again measured here in

79
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,599
centimeters

80
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,479
now plants facing impact on flower yield

81
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:37,119
because that's what we're kind of

82
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,199
looking at

83
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
is kind of the yield and particularly

84
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,238
the flower yield

85
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,080
well the five foot by five foot spacing

86
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,080
resulted in the greatest amount of dry

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,200
matter flower yield in pounds per plant

88
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,360
this could be correlated with the

89
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,439
highest pounds per plant weight

90
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,280
however the one foot by one foot spacing

91
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,159
resulted in the greatest amount of dry

92
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,120
flower yield

93
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,878
in pounds per acre so again important to

94
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,599
make this distinction between pounds per

95
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,518
plant

96
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,959
and pounds per acre if you're going to

97
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,158
be growing on a very large scale and

98
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,280
you're concerned about pulling the most

99
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,280
pounds per acre

100
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,800
that can slide you to one spacing if

101
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,080
you're limited on the number of plants

102
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,400
you want to have the highest

103
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
pound per plant well that might shift to

104
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
a different spacing

105
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,120
if you're curious with some more the

106
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,878
detail the data looked like the data

107
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,158
table is provided down here

108
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,239
on this slide and you're welcome to

109
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,199
pause the video

110
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,680
now the planting date impact on plant

111
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,238
weight

112
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,080
and height as might be expected the

113
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,239
plant weight in pounds per plant

114
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,519
decreased as the planting dates became

115
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,039
later in the year

116
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,200
and we can clearly see that with the

117
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,318
planting date of june 14th june 21st and

118
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,158
june 27th

119
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,238
and the plant weight in pounds overall

120
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,639
decreasing from there as you eat with

121
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,719
each

122
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,238
proceeding later planting date from the

123
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,000
one studied

124
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,280
now planting dates impact on flower

125
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,280
yield because again it always comes back

126
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,039
to kind of that yield in the end

127
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,318
it was surprising when averaged across

128
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,318
all plant spacings

129
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,238
there was no significant differences

130
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,479
observed between planting dates

131
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,239
for flower yield however there were

132
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,919
differences noted when plant spacing and

133
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,239
planting date interactions

134
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,839
were investigated so that's just an

135
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,280
important kind of note there that where

136
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,319
where were there differences and where

137
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,560
they're not differences

138
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,959
again see the data here really at the

139
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,319
lsd level of 0.1

140
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,600
no significant difference shown here

141
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,759
now we're looking at our planting

142
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,919
spacing

143
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,439
myself here plant spacing impact and

144
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:31,039
yield and also

145
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,959
plant weight well the june 14 2018

146
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,439
planting the five by five foot spacing

147
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,198
plants

148
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,680
showed the best yields and highest

149
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,840
amounts of unmarketable buds

150
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,439
on a per plant basis for the june 21st

151
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,439
planting the one foot by one foot

152
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,360
spacing had the best yield and least

153
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,800
amount of unmarkable buds

154
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,199
per acre basis and here we have the five

155
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,199
by

156
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,040
five foot spacing again for the 27th

157
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,639
planting having the best yield and

158
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
greatest amount of unmarketable buds

159
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,879
per plant so again looking the data here

160
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,879
we can see the different spacings

161
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,120
different planting dates here's the 14th

162
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,719
the 21st and the 27th

163
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
i've tried to provide a little bit of a

164
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
summary here focusing on them see the

165
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,560
plant weight

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,120
dry matter or flower unmarketable dry

167
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
flower

168
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,160
dry amount of flower yield in a

169
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,120
marketable dry flower yield as well so

170
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
it's important to take into

171
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,478
consideration

172
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,160
that unmarkable dry flour as well as far

173
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,439
as what might be considered to be a loss

174
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,320
or need to go really to

175
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,600
extraction or be a lesser quality

176
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,360
overall

177
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
so the conclusions is that surprisingly

178
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,600
the 5 by 5 foot treatment generally had

179
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,560
the greatest amount of unmarketable buds

180
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,919
per acre on a per plant basis however

181
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,918
this could be explained because the

182
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,918
flower buds were deemed unmarketable

183
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,198
primarily due to soil contamination that

184
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:43,758
was simply because the plants were so

185
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,439
big

186
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,960
there could be some drooping effects to

187
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,879
occur so it's important

188
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,239
yes it produces produce those

189
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,079
unmarketable buds

190
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,879
but this was a reason why they were

191
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:57,839
considered to be unmarketable

192
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,519
now as always weather has an impact and

193
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,239
climate variability may

194
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,560
affect the yield benefit for example

195
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,519
comparing the 27th of june planting

196
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,319
compared to that 27th of june planting

197
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,519
the june 17 planting yielded 165 pounds

198
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,319
of dry matter bud

199
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,879
uh per acre more and the june 21st

200
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,400
planting yield did about 488 pounds of

201
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,879
dry matter per bud

202
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,439
per acre more even though it was planted

203
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,680
seven days after the june 14 planting

204
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,360
it yielded more this could be because

205
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
june was a relatively cold month for

206
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,400
this

207
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,120
2018 year compared to historical

208
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,359
averages

209
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,160
which may have stunted the june 14th

210
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
planting

211
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,919
so again this just kind of shows you the

212
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,478
variability and sometimes the luck of

213
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,120
the draw

214
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,079
when you're looking at outdoor planting

215
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,079
lastly just my

216
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,758
end kind of grower suggestions of we

217
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,038
looked at all this information

218
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,479
you know what can i kind of like pull

219
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,759
from this information what could i use

220
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,560
for this information

221
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,360
well in regards to plant spacing if your

222
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
area is

223
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,319
limited size greater plant spacing of 5

224
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,720
foot by 5 foot is advised

225
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,680
to grow larger plants growers are

226
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,000
suggested

227
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,319
to apply more individual care to each

228
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,759
plant to reduce the unmarketable dry

229
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,160
flower yield

230
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,879
however if you're in a growing situation

231
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,280
that your area is not space limited

232
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,000
then a drastic reduced plant spacing to

233
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,318
all the way down to

234
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,639
one foot by one foot will increase the

235
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,280
dry matter flower yield in pounds per

236
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,598
acre

237
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,318
with reduced need for individual plant

238
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:25,519
care

239
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,680
so again everyone wants to know what the

240
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,598
ideal plant spacing is we can come down

241
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,519
to what the grower's conditions are

242
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,879
as far as planting date goes assuming

243
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,399
favorable weather

244
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,918
mid-june should be the target planting

245
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,839
date to allow for timing with the

246
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,318
longest photo periods of the year

247
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,279
to hopefully retail in the best yields

248
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,479
at the end

249
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,000
so again these are just some grower

250
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,359
suggestions here but kind of that

251
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,038
interesting note

252
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,439
if you're looking at the pounds per acre

253
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,519
or pounds per plant how that will affect

254
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,439
your spacing and that really comes down

255
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,279
to your method or style

256
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,360
of growing so hopefully this was helpful

257
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,279
to digest some of this complex data

258
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,360
to give you some actual suggestions that

259
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,159
you can apply to your field growing

260
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,160
situation
