1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,879
here on this debaco university video go

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,490
over understanding light intensity to

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:10,179
drive cannabis production

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,179
[Music]

5
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,919
all right let's see how light intensity

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,679
plays a role with cannabis production

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,199
well first off giving the plant more

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,160
light you think would naturally always

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,600
be better

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,039
and when you give the plant more light

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
this can theoretically increase

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,039
photosynthesis

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,719
and result in more biomass however no

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,599
other factors can be limiting for this

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,519
to occur

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
those other factors can include water

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,120
nutrients

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,239
air carbon dioxide and kind of a few

19
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,799
other things

20
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:45,839
increasing ppfd past 850 to 900 micro

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,599
moles per meter per second a meter

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
squared per second will require carbon

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,840
oxide enrichment to take advantage of

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,480
this

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,680
level of light so just keep that in mind

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,878
and we're looking at you know we want to

27
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,679
have a good root structure we don't have

28
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,079
any disease

29
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,759
there's other little factors to consider

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,439
but when we start to get above that 850

31
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,640
to 900 if you're not supplementing with

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,640
carbon dioxide

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,239
you're not going to allow those plants

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,840
to take full advantage of that

35
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,239
additional light intensity

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,799
that you're providing for them so light

37
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,879
intensity by strain well all cannabis

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,920
can be treated as a high light intensity

39
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,239
tolerant

40
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,840
since all have been bred outside for an

41
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,118
extended period of time

42
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,880
during the history of plants

43
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,680
domestication process

44
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,599
so what that means is because this is a

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,159
recently brought inside plant

46
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,959
but for the most part an outdoor grown

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
plant

48
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,319
is been bred and allowed to be able to

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,720
handle

50
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,239
the intensities of natural sunlight

51
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,560
which typically is a lot higher than

52
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,399
what

53
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,159
plants would be experiencing in an

54
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
indoor environment we can see our light

55
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,320
intensity increasing and our yield

56
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,159
also increasing while this does look

57
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,559
linear don't think that this continues

58
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,680
on

59
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,519
forever so growers typically increase

60
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
the ppfd as the plant

61
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,640
ages and that's simply referring to the

62
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
intensity

63
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,320
of light so while some growers increase

64
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
light intensity with age

65
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,879
if the plant requirements are kept

66
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,919
optimum plants can be grown at high

67
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,478
consistent ppfds and again that stands

68
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,000
for photosynthetic photon flux density

69
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,760
this can be a challenge with water

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,719
especially when plants and root systems

71
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,159
are small

72
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,159
so this is part of the reason why

73
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,719
growers tend to increase that as plants

74
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,400
age

75
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,560
but as in the picture here shows that

76
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
the graph whereas we're increasing those

77
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
intensities here

78
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,039
with the vegetative going to fruits and

79
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,878
flowering kind of going to the end here

80
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,519
this potentially could be brought up

81
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:34,159
much sooner because maintaining high pdf

82
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,360
ppfd will maximize plant productivity

83
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,639
for all strains

84
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,800
but is especially important for

85
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,719
autoflowers that have only a limited

86
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
number of days to complete their life

87
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,639
cycle

88
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,319
so you want to give the plant as much

89
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,199
light as it can handle without burning

90
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,598
it or causing

91
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,039
negative setbacks and typically this can

92
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,719
be a little bit higher

93
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,239
then some growers often will provide

94
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,479
their plants

95
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,759
so we're looking at net photosynthesis

96
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,119
while increasing

97
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,719
the transpiration so netflix and this

98
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
and transpiration while increasing the

99
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,800
light intensity measured in ppfd

100
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,719
photosynthetic response of cannabis

101
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
variations in net photosynthesis for

102
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,519
cannabis sativa with varying

103
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,680
photosynthetic photon flux

104
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,439
densities remember that's what ppfd

105
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,319
stands for in temperature conditions

106
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,400
expressed

107
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,000
in celsius so if we look at our little

108
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
graphs here what does this kind of mean

109
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
well we have our photon flux density

110
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,919
again both on the

111
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,878
x-axis down here and net photosynthesis

112
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,958
here on the

113
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,560
y and we can see that there is an

114
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,439
increase and then kind of

115
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,759
all leveling off here with regards to

116
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,719
net

117
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,079
photosynthesis here on this graph here

118
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,919
we have the rate of transpiration which

119
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,280
is the movement of water through plants

120
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,878
so when we're looking at photosynthetic

121
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,840
rate we are seeing kind of a little bit

122
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:47,039
of a leveling off sometimes a decrease

123
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,959
kind of above that that same 1500 we're

124
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,318
seeing water consumption also being at

125
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,920
the highest level so you want to have

126
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,079
this balance between the plants being

127
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,598
able to maintain their trigger pressure

128
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,680
while still growing at the most

129
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,560
aggressive rate possible

130
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,120
so light intensity maximum while no

131
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,519
carbon

132
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,360
dioxide enrichment the maximum ppfd for

133
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
the plants utilize is about 900

134
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,439
micromiles per

135
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,519
meter squared per second for plants to

136
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,598
use higher light levels

137
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,599
over this this carbon dioxide needs to

138
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,560
be added to the growing environment so

139
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,000
this is where

140
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,918
we're having we can add more light and

141
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,279
that's great but we want to

142
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,599
maximize that we want to be

143
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,399
supplementing also with carbon dioxide

144
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,400
in one note about this graph the 2

145
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,198
should be as a subscript not a

146
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,599
superscript so just keep that in mind

147
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
the ppfd level determination by co2

148
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
concentration

149
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,239
so this is referring to concentration of

150
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
co2

151
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
right up right up over here since co2

152
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,919
concentration will be the limiting

153
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
factor the level of carbon dioxide in a

154
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,680
growth space determines the maximum

155
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,519
light intensity plants can use and we

156
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,439
see that represented right here

157
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,560
and again this assumes all their factors

158
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,120
are not limiting

159
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,319
water nutrients health of the plant in

160
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,759
in general

161
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,800
so if we're maximizing at 400 parts per

162
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,319
million

163
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
for carbon dioxide to be the natural

164
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,360
atmospheric conditions looking at a

165
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,919
light intensity

166
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
estimated on this graph around 500 if we

167
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,399
double our carbon dioxide

168
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,240
we go from about 500 to about probably

169
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,038
850

170
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,879
ppfds and we go to 1400 in this graph

171
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,439
represented here we can go over a

172
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,439
thousand

173
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,560
on the light intensity so again keep

174
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,319
that in mind that

175
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
yes you can give plants more light but

176
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,240
if they don't have the co2 they will not

177
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,360
be able to utilize that light

178
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,038
so light intensity at both extremes so

179
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,960
while growers focus on the maximum light

180
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,879
intensity to get the greatest yield for

181
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,079
photoperiod dependent strains it's also

182
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,079
important to consider the other

183
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,319
end of the spectrum while it can be

184
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,079
difficult to measure low light levels

185
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,918
without special sensitive equipment at

186
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,359
least it is also important to consider

187
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,038
how dark the dark period

188
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,479
needs to be a lot of growers are

189
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,279
concerned with blackout and one little

190
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:52,639
pinhole

191
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,119
and they want to make sure that there's

192
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,439
absolutely zero light at all

193
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,800
so how dark should the dark period be

194
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,160
and this is a good question particularly

195
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
for the indoor growers

196
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,960
well most growers will ensure that

197
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,560
there's not a pinhole sized amount of

198
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,038
light entering plants during this dark

199
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,519
phase

200
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,639
this may be unnecessary keep in mind

201
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,639
plants growing outside

202
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,000
regular photoperiod dependent ones full

203
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,560
moon light will not

204
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,720
impact cannabis light sensitive at night

205
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,918
just like poinsettias so the full moon

206
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,080
intensity of light

207
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,120
will not affect canvas plants however it

208
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,038
may not take much

209
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
more light exposure than a full moon to

210
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,279
have plants considered to be a

211
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,199
day or a light on period so just realize

212
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,119
that dark does not have to be 100

213
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,960
no light so while it is important to

214
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
kind of seal areas off you don't have to

215
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,758
be

216
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,399
completely going over every teeny little

217
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
pinhole

218
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,839
on the sense that your whole plant is

219
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,800
going to flip into flower or go and stay

220
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,959
in veg

221
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,879
keep in mind plants grown outside full

222
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,198
moon light keeps them on the same

223
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,000
photo period so again just keep that in

224
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,360
mind particularly

225
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,360
for the indoor growers
