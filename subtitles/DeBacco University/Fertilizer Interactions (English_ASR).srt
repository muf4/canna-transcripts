1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,599
okay when girls are looking at applying

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,580
fertilizers they typically want to do it

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,140
an efficient way a lot of times this can

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,120
lead to growers wanting to mix

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,129
fertilizers it's important to keep in

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,539
mind fertilizers do interact with one

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,339
another they can be a positive

8
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,559
interaction as we see with these gears

9
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,649
or it can be a negative interaction if

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,698
we want everything working together

11
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:22,439
so this interactions mixing different

12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,910
providers a lot of births - it is it and

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,219
save time and it's a great advantage

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,679
however there's also the possibility of

15
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,358
some unwanted interactions it's

16
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,009
beneficial to only tank mix certain

17
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,770
nutrients to reduce the chance of

18
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,750
negative interactions so our example

19
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,190
here for looking to produce color we mix

20
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,890
all three together we're going to get in

21
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:43,349
some case white or we're not producing a

22
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,579
one of the three colors here so you keep

23
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,280
in mind those interactions can be

24
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,950
beneficial but they can also be negative

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,350
so keep the amount of fertilizers you're

26
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,539
mixing together minimal because you'll

27
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,210
reduce the chance of having unwanted

28
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,100
results now certain flowers cannot be

29
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,140
take pics but spacing out applications

30
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,090
in spoon-feeding plants is more

31
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,099
advantageous to the grow psycho anyway

32
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,228
however you a lot of times if you read

33
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,938
labels they'll say perform a jar test if

34
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:10,859
there are questions well what a jar test

35
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,779
is is where you mix the chemicals ahead

36
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,459
of time in a clear jar and visually

37
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,650
inspect them to see if there's a

38
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,599
separation or other forms of interaction

39
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,100
if you mix everything together and let

40
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,309
it settle for a little bit it comes up

41
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,589
nice and consistent this would be a very

42
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,450
positive result however if you mix

43
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,439
everything and get this separation these

44
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,728
are in evidence a visual sign that these

45
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,500
fertilizers may have a negative

46
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:36,900
interaction and you don't want to apply

47
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,700
these to your plant also if you mix them

48
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,380
together you wanna let them settle and

49
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,390
see if any precipitate forms it's a

50
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,118
solid as a result mixing two liquids

51
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,799
that would be another negative when

52
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,969
you're performing the jar test you don't

53
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,799
want to simply splash everything in the

54
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:51,328
jar take a quick look and move on I'm

55
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,430
gonna give it some time to have an

56
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:55,289
interaction to see if a precipitate will

57
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,570
form sometimes it's gonna take several

58
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,610
minutes or I usually let them sit for

59
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:00,929
about half an hour go back and inspect

60
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,569
them and if it all looks nice and

61
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,689
consistent then you have a very good

62
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,978
odds of having low odds of negative

63
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:09,030
interactions even as you're going

64
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,250
through and applying the various

65
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,969
products well that gives you some idea

66
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,979
of what to look for and what to

67
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:17,379
consider when mixing fertilizers to have

68
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:19,949
positive interactions in benefits of

69
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,949
saving time
