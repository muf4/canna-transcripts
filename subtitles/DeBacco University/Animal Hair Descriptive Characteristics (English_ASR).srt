1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,318
welcome to debaco university here we're

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,440
going to be looking at

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:10,320
animal hair descriptive characteristics

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,839
and some of the distinguishing factors

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,839
that we look at when we're looking at

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,559
hair particularly at the microscopic

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,079
level so starting with why is animal

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,599
hair in general important

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,358
well if evidence shows animal hair

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
present it can generate questions

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,640
such as if the victim does not own a dog

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,840
it could

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,760
interfere with suspect owns a dog or has

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,479
come in contact with a dog

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,399
also dna can be removed from animal's

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,759
mouth if bitten and blood samples can be

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,320
moved from the animal's fur

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,280
feet or etc so when we're looking at why

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,960
is handle air

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,640
important even in forensics

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,359
investigation

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,039
identifying animal hair can be very

23
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,719
important

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
there's different types of animal hair

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,800
so keep in mind when we're looking at

26
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,519
comparison different hair types on

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,519
animals

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,199
we are often looking at guard hairs

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,879
which are thicker

30
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,719
longer straight and form the outer

31
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,759
protective coat of an animal

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,558
the fur or wool hairs are thinner often

33
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,319
soft

34
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,399
kinked and not straight and found close

35
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,679
to the skin forming an insulating inner

36
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,359
coat to the animal

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,040
and we have tactile hairs which provide

38
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,319
sensory functions and typically found

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,479
the head of animals

40
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,199
such as the whiskers let me just kind of

41
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:21,118
see this quick comparison here

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,960
of here's here's the dog here's the

43
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,640
guard here and here's the under fur here

44
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,719
you can just see from the same dog

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
this stark difference in those animal

46
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,599
hair types just on quick

47
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,560
visual inspection both at 400

48
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,478
times magnification now the cuticle

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,840
scale pattern is another area we want to

50
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,679
be looking at

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,680
we have the intricate scales that are

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,840
random overlapping patterns

53
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,320
much like roof tiles and are often

54
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,960
flattened so here's that example here

55
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,239
of the intricate kind of scale pattern

56
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,839
that we see

57
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,239
then we have the spinous which are

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,240
scales that have spiny long and pointed

59
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,839
appearance that overlap and you can

60
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,239
definitely see that here in the

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,399
mink here then we have the coronal which

62
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,798
are crown like scale pattern which is

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,640
very

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,200
fine hairs it looks like a stack of

65
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,399
paper cups common in small rodents

66
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,479
bats and is very rare in humans

67
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,000
so this is an example here of bat hair

68
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,878
and we can see clearly

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,598
on how it's very distinctive on a visual

70
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,239
basis

71
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,598
compared to the mink hair here or just

72
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,280
kind of the unidentified animal here

73
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,759
with the intricate scale pattern

74
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,959
this is an important method of being

75
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,039
able to identify

76
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,280
for at least classifying the hair in a

77
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,439
particular species

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
moving on to the cortex color was a wide

79
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,639
range of natural colors and shadings

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
that do occur and we see a couple of

81
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,598
them here

82
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,280
we have guard hairs of a black bear a

83
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,439
brown bear and a polar bear

84
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,039
and just click on that cortex color

85
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,439
that's the region right here we can see

86
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,439
the

87
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,759
differences as well here and those

88
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,519
colors in shadings

89
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,518
then we have the medulla description

90
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,239
categories so how we kind of going

91
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,239
through

92
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,158
and describing the different medulla

93
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,759
regions well let's remember the medulla

94
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,158
is the innermost layer of the hair and

95
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,598
serves

96
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,318
as kind of the mirror of the hair that

97
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,919
center portion it's composed of air

98
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,560
filled components that are typically

99
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,679
harder to see in human hair compared to

100
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,158
other animals

101
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,519
looking here at the coyote the harbor

102
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,158
seal and the raccoon

103
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,039
we can definitely see some major

104
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,318
differences

105
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:25,120
in how we classify the different medulla

106
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,839
patterns that we notice now those

107
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,080
patterns

108
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
specifically we're looking at they could

109
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,719
be absent

110
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,280
they could be fragmented they could be

111
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,959
intermittent or they could be continuous

112
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
and there's just one example of looking

113
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,439
kind of a far away

114
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,439
microscopic view of the fischer cat on

115
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,079
how we definitely see a unique

116
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,120
medulla pattern here there's different

117
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,200
structures

118
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,560
so here's just that quick kind of uh

119
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:53,759
comparison of morris

120
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,719
morris a cereal multi-serial

121
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,199
cellular or a lattice so this amorphous

122
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,919
kind of

123
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,759
shape here let me get into the lattice

124
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,280
the multi-cereal the unicereal

125
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,158
very distinctive patterns and we're

126
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,479
going to see some examples of those here

127
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,519
so first off starting with the amorphous

128
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,598
shape

129
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,840
it appears as a solid line but lacks a

130
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,560
clear pattern or

131
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,920
structure and this is what we're

132
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,079
noticing here

133
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,599
and looking at a jersey cow's hair

134
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,478
sample at 400 uh

135
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,840
i'm sorry at 40 microns here this is an

136
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,439
example of this

137
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,439
amorphous shape and if you're not with

138
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,040
the jersey cow that's what one

139
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,360
looks like there the uni on this serial

140
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,439
has one ladder row of components running

141
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
down the hair longitudinally

142
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,279
and here's kind of what the general

143
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,758
image looks like and the example of that

144
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,478
would be

145
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,040
guinea pig here so we can see that ud

146
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,639
surreal pattern here to the medulla

147
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,720
and there's a happy little guinea pig

148
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,720
there looking at the camera

149
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,720
then we have the multi cereal here and

150
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
this is looking at an example of

151
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
rabbit hair would fall under this

152
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,000
category this has multiple

153
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,600
ladder rows components running down the

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,399
hair again in that longitudinal

155
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
direction

156
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,399
and we can see that evident here keeping

157
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,160
it the same magnification

158
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:11,918
of 4 40 microns here with

159
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,080
rabbit here then we have the um

160
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,758
cellular where we're looking at a wide

161
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,159
band of randomly shaped

162
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
cell-like structures and the silver fox

163
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,639
would be an example here

164
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,439
of this medulla pattern and looking at

165
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,800
each one of these bars removing 10

166
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,918
micro meters here then this

167
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,800
lattice structure so this can occupy

168
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,799
nearly the entire width of the hair with

169
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,478
small circular shaped components

170
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,120
if you look really closely here at this

171
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,319
deer hair sample we definitely see that

172
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,759
and again there's filled us there's

173
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,319
partially filled this would be

174
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,960
considered

175
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,719
filled of this white-tailed deer in the

176
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,079
image here

177
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
now we have something also called the

178
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,240
medulla index this describes

179
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,240
the thickness of the medulla layer in

180
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,680
humans the value of the medullary index

181
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,519
is usually about 1 3 or less and that of

182
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,079
animal hair is typically

183
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,758
one half or greater and how we get that

184
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,560
is looking at the diameter of the

185
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,439
medulla

186
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,160
compared to to the diameter of the

187
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,639
actual

188
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
hair so how do we go about that

189
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,079
calculation

190
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,918
again using a microscope that would

191
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,318
ideally have

192
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,918
some way of measuring that the index

193
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,680
this medullary index is calculated by

194
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,639
dividing the modular width

195
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,400
by the width of the entire cortex here

196
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,439
we'd write those two numbers down

197
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,159
we divide those two and we multiply by

198
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,439
100 here and here's the diameter here's

199
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
the total width there

200
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,199
and we would simply divide those two to

201
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,038
get this medullary index

202
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,319
this can be important for identification

203
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,159
for classifying

204
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,840
and keep in mind this still always falls

205
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,800
under that area of class evidence not

206
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,679
individual

207
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
evidence but still important to document

208
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,478
and

209
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,319
when we're looking at developing an

210
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,240
understanding and comparison

211
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,080
of different animal hairs as we saw in

212
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,079
the images in this presentation
