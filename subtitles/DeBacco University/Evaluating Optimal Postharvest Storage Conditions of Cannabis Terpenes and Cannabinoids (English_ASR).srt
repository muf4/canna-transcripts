1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,480
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,720
going to go through a research article

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,000
that evaluated the optimum post-harvest

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,759
storage conditions

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,359
for cannabis terpenes as well as

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,039
cannabinoids now this

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,119
is a great research article however

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,839
there is a lot of data presented

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,439
so you're encouraged to pause download

10
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,198
the slides pause the video

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,800
look at the original research article a

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,840
lot of great information does get a

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,160
little complex

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,160
hopefully here we can break it down for

15
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:31,839
you

16
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:37,039
[Music]

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
all right let's get into evaluating

18
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:42,000
optimum post-harvest storage conditions

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,840
of cannabis terpenes and cannabinoids as

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
mentioned before be sure to look at the

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,079
original research article

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
presented right here fairly recent go

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,558
through the data

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,320
download it and take a look at it for

25
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,479
yourself a lot of great information

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,439
here so first off let's start with some

27
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,519
of the basics we're looking at

28
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,718
decarboxylation and oxidation products

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,000
of the delta nine

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,359
thca so thca oxidation will be

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,879
converting it to

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:11,760
uh cbna and decarboxylation delta nine

33
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:14,879
thc or if we decarb decarboxylate

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,400
a we get uh cbn here if we oxidize

35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,920
delta 9 thc we also get cbn so

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,920
kind of getting into some of the

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,960
complexities of the chemical

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,040
pathways here so let's compare

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,239
of our phytocannabinoids here and this

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,720
is looking at the

41
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,839
data presented and this kind of carries

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,879
throughout

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,359
cbn in whole and ground samples of type

44
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,719
3

45
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:42,000
chemovar which were qualified by uhplc

46
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,200
in uv at four month intervals over the

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,560
course of a year

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,680
so when we see things like t0 t4

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,640
t8 and t12 all of those in our data

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,640
tables that we're going to see

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,000
correspond with the initial time

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,079
in 4 8 and 12 months of storage

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,560
respectively so if we go through and we

54
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,639
see t0 well that's the initial point

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,799
t4 would be four months t8 would be

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,560
eight months and t12 here would be 12

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,000
months or one calendar year

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,199
statistically significant differences

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,878
were observed in all treatments

60
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,639
temperatures and time points

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,959
compared with t0 which is the original

62
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,519
point and we can see that data presented

63
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,439
here

64
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,640
we see the different p levels with the

65
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,479
different level of

66
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,159
stars or asterisks then what we're

67
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,959
looking at is whole plant

68
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,759
for thc delta 9 thc and cbn and then

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,039
ground plant

70
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,959
same thing delta 9 thc as well as cbn

71
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,318
and we're noticing overall the general

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,199
trend here

73
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,759
as our we're looking at for t0 looking

74
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,119
at the

75
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,878
t zero is that initial that's why

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,599
there's only one bar there

77
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,039
and then we see four months eight months

78
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,399
twelve months four eight twelve four

79
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,000
eight twelve so on and so forth we'll

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,480
notice that this 25 degrees

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,519
celsius temperature had the greatest

82
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,799
degree of kind of

83
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,959
breakdown there and the colder

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
temperatures were relatively similar

85
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,759
across the board there

86
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,280
and that hotel true both for the

87
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,560
delta 9 thc as well as a cbd presented

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,239
here

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,840
now whole versus ground plant samples

90
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
this is one thing that the study did

91
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,319
look at and this comparison of delta

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,759
nine thc and cpn concentrations in hole

93
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:12,639
and ground samples at different storage

94
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,639
temperatures

95
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,759
for four eight and twelve months data

96
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,598
presented here

97
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,359
so again here's our four month eight

98
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,518
months and one year

99
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
later held at the different temperatures

100
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,560
and again we see relatively

101
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,560
similar results here uh kind of the same

102
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,598
thing here and we but we do notice

103
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,799
down here at one year looking at the

104
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,000
delta 9 thc

105
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,360
the 25 degrees celsius temperatures

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,598
seem to have the greatest kind of

107
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
breakdown evidence there

108
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,280
so let's make the cannabinoid comparison

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,959
here comparisons of the full

110
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,959
phytocannabinoid cbn

111
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,120
profiles in hole and ground type 1 and

112
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,080
type 3 cannabis inflorescence after one

113
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,959
year of storage at different

114
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
temperatures

115
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,640
the phytocannabinoids were identified

116
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,799
and qualified using the

117
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,318
very precise methods here at the initial

118
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,040
time and after 12 months

119
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,958
storage time 0 and t12 respectively they

120
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,679
looked at an n which is basically about

121
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,360
three

122
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,200
plant samples here absolute

123
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,799
concentrations were color-coded

124
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,878
relative to the maximum value for each

125
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,680
compound that we're going to see in the

126
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,438
next

127
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
slides so i'm going to show some of the

128
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,639
data this is kind of the background to

129
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,079
that data because i wanted to have it be

130
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,319
on the full slide set

131
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,918
and just as a reminder as all the videos

132
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,279
in the description you can find a link

133
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,279
to the actual slides

134
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,439
as well as citation for all the material

135
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,959
and images that are used

136
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,639
this might be a good time to utilize

137
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,000
that so you can get this kind of good

138
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,400
quality information

139
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,560
and there's a lot going on here so red

140
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,638
and blue arrows indicate decarbolog

141
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,680
carboxylation and aging pathways

142
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,759
respectively

143
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360
we're seeing that move through here so

144
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,479
if i kind of like position myself

145
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,919
i have to block some of it sadly here

146
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,719
we're looking at the aging the

147
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:53,758
biosynthesis products here we see the

148
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,440
different components in whole samples

149
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,040
as well as ground samples at different

150
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,079
temperatures at

151
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,120
12 months same thing here we're looking

152
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,918
at whole and ground plant samples and

153
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,840
then we have

154
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,758
our kind of aging that occurs in

155
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,758
decarboxylation that occurs acids

156
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,240
to neutrals there we're seeing the

157
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,680
darker colors are darker i should say

158
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,519
box highlights represent more the

159
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,120
maximum and the white

160
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,198
or lighter coloration showing where the

161
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,959
breakdown is occurring

162
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,319
so i'm going to kind of move myself kind

163
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,560
of off

164
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,159
off to the side up here i should say

165
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,918
welcome to pause the video

166
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,280
and take a look at this again remember

167
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,439
this is looking at the uh

168
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,638
delta nine thc the next one we're gonna

169
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,519
look is the um

170
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,120
at the cbd levels same information

171
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,560
presented

172
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
so here thc now here is the cbd blue and

173
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
arrow

174
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,319
blue red and blue arrows indicate

175
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,680
decarboxation aging pathways

176
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,360
respectively again

177
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,199
we're seeing basically the same kind of

178
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,600
breakdown or same

179
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,120
way that data is presented don't worry

180
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,039
i'll get to some general conclusions

181
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,319
here let me move myself again

182
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,839
so you can kind of get an idea of the

183
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,120
full data set that's what i like about

184
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,560
these scientific studies they present

185
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,918
with a lot of information a lot of

186
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,000
detail

187
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,519
but some people don't really want to be

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,399
interested in all the details want the

189
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,879
bigger picture

190
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,359
but i want to provide you with this so

191
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,639
look at the general terpene comparisons

192
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,960
so comparisons here looking at just two

193
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,720
terpene concentrations again looking at

194
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,478
the different temperatures

195
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,639
times zero here when they initially

196
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,839
harvest and then whole plants and ground

197
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,918
plant samples at the different

198
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,439
temperatures for our different terpenes

199
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,959
so important just to keep in mind that

200
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,680
definitely we're noticing here the

201
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,239
initial

202
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,319
was definitely higher we had degradation

203
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,840
at all of these um intervals

204
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,600
here at all these different um

205
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,719
temperatures so again just important to

206
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,800
keep that in mind

207
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,840
we're looking at basically time zero and

208
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,360
then four month

209
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,959
storage uh for a duration of time

210
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,800
now stripping profiles that we see kind

211
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,038
of the same thing here the

212
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,439
maximum or 100 percent and then what

213
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,279
they kind of uh broke down to

214
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,279
their respective terpene profiles

215
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,799
comparisons of terpene profiles and the

216
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,239
hole in ground type 3 cannabis

217
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,360
inflorescence after four months of

218
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,360
storage t4

219
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,038
at different temperatures absolute

220
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,960
concentrations were color-coded relative

221
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,560
the maximum value of each compound

222
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,719
so again here's time zero concerned to

223
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,240
be the maximum we can see they all had a

224
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,840
degree of breakdown

225
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,598
darker colorations are representing

226
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,159
where the breakdown was slower

227
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,120
and the lighter colorations indicate a

228
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,160
more

229
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,000
negative or greater degree of breakdown

230
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
just for a quick example here looking at

231
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,319
here looking at 99

232
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,080
here we've worked out like 22 percent

233
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,680
it's like 22 percent of what

234
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,839
originally it started with just to give

235
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,639
you a general idea good to kind of use

236
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,399
that number

237
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,000
again welcome to pause look at the data

238
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,758
here at the different terpene profiles

239
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,279
looking at cannabis insolvent so they

240
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,240
also looked at guidance on how to store

241
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,478
these

242
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
dmso very common solvent used in

243
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,878
scientific laboratories

244
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,399
ethanol and olive oil and we'll notice

245
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,319
that there is definitely this kind of

246
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,198
change at these different temperatures

247
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,160
at time zero uh t6 and t12 so it'd be

248
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,400
six months

249
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
and then a year and what we generally

250
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,959
noticed to kind of give you the general

251
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,319
taco message

252
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,680
message in both thc and cbd for the most

253
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,439
part the olive oil

254
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,560
seem to have the least amount of

255
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,000
breakdown compared to dmso or ethanol

256
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,680
very important for those looking at

257
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,639
studying these in labs because a lot of

258
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,199
times dmso

259
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,840
is the lab standard we can see that

260
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,520
there was

261
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,839
a fair amount greater amount of

262
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,639
breakdown particularly at 25 degrees

263
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,000
celsius so with the general conclusions

264
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,120
hopefully all that data didn't scare you

265
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,918
off and you're still here watching the

266
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,759
video

267
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,598
but for phytocannabinoids and cannabis

268
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,599
inflorescence are more stable during

269
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,599
storage compared with extracts under

270
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,278
similar conditions

271
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,440
terpenoid concentrations were found to

272
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,679
decrease rapidly under all storage

273
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,760
conditions but temperatures lower than

274
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,120
negative 20 degrees celsius in grinding

275
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,600
of the inflorescence

276
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,799
were the least favorable conditions this

277
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,399
is what should be avoided if you're

278
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,439
looking for long-term storage and

279
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,399
preservation

280
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,920
of terpenes olive oil was found to be

281
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,919
the best vehicle for preserving the

282
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,319
natural phytocannabinoid composition

283
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,599
of the extracts so kind of an important

284
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,920
note right there

285
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,000
so lastly the best preservation

286
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:10,639
conditions would be storage of the whole

287
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,639
inflorescence and extracts dissolved in

288
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,559
olive oil at four degrees celsius were

289
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,360
the optimum post-harvest conditions for

290
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,199
cannabis

291
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,360
so we take all that confusing

292
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,320
information and here's our quick little

293
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,680
general summary here but as always

294
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,760
scientific studies can be great to

295
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,519
investigate and look at the details

296
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,639
welcome to go back take a look at those

297
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,399
pause some of those look in the

298
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,759
description download the videos

299
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,278
download the slides take a look at it

300
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,919
for yourself but if you want that quick

301
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,240
storage

302
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,958
uh conditions based on all that data

303
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,959
presented

304
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,799
this is your quick little summary here

305
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,518
and hopefully you found the scientific

306
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,679
study

307
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,759
interesting and will help you better

308
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,679
store and maintain

309
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,439
the conditions and preservation of the

310
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:53,120
important cannabinoids and terpenes

311
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,120
within your cannabis plants
