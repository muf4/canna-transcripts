1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
while two greenhouses may look very

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,179
similar in structure there are many

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,660
options when it comes to covering a

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:14,218
greenhouse or what type of plastic or

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,210
glass or copolymer do you use to act as

6
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:17,309
a barrier between the outside

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,160
environment and how to protect your

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,509
plants on the inside so first off

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,760
greenhouses sometimes are called class

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,250
houses because you know he used to be

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,439
made out of entirely glass glass is

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,079
great because it offers excellent a high

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,480
percent of light transmission does have

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,570
a very long service life potentially

15
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:39,269
decades however what some pros also come

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,878
some cons so this material can shatter

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,370
if it gets loose if there's wind if

18
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,229
there's snow load and it's typically

19
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,019
more expensive material and some of the

20
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,279
other options I'm going to talk about

21
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,440
should be tempered glass to prevent

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,780
shattering or breaking of a panel that

23
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,238
can help protect not only the plants but

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,600
the people working in the greenhouse

25
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:02,729
also when it's using glass the panel's

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,040
even for small panels for their size can

27
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:08,219
be very heavy and hard to transport and

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,840
store polycarbonate another option this

29
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,780
is a strong lightweight material

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,978
it's almost as transparent as glass and

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,960
it's considered by some to be the

32
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,359
jack-of-all-trades to us due to its

33
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:21,688
durability and ease with working with it

34
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:24,209
it lasts for about ten years so that's a

35
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:26,069
good for most growers good longevity and

36
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,949
it can be used on you know straight

37
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,868
panels or it can also in some cases

38
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:34,200
beatitude true hoop houses and that's

39
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:36,118
polycarbonate polyethylene is the least

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,799
expensive covering material it's kind of

41
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,450
like this cleaning wrap is something to

42
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,850
think about it it does come in different

43
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,579
thicknesses typically three mil to eight

44
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,769
mil is the general kind of variance and

45
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,078
it comes and that's mils same four

46
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,840
millimeters he typically only lasts for

47
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:54,539
about four years and that's the average

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,270
material because there's wind there's a

49
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,740
lot of stressors on that plastic six mil

50
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:01,170
is considered in general to be the

51
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:03,149
standard 3 mils kind of use for that one

52
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,930
time user that small structures 8 mil

53
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,610
can be a little bit stronger in

54
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:11,219
environments that I'm needing of that

55
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,900
little bit thicker polyethylene covering

56
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,919
there's different types of polyethylene

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,810
there's

58
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,909
Antti condensation ones it reduces the

59
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,318
dripping okay but this can also reduce

60
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:21,209
our impact some of the light

61
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,799
transmission could also be thermally

62
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,259
protected if you're looking at using

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,660
this structure in particularly colder

64
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,848
months it's delivered in large rolls of

65
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,560
plastic which can make installation at

66
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:34,259
least the first part of installation a

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,239
little challenging especially if it's a

68
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,789
windy day that you can gotta get

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,830
everyone together any winds this large

70
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:43,348
sail can easily catch that and make it

71
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,420
very difficult to install then there's

72
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:51,179
copolymers and resins ethylene

73
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:53,339
tetrafluoroethylene is a copolymer ETFE

74
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,719
film is what's called this is a

75
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,400
high-performance film that goes from

76
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,620
before the trade name F Queen as

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,019
potential benefits overall the previous

78
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,659
mentioned covering materials has a very

79
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:07,019
high light transmission transmission at

80
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:09,180
about 93 also allows UV light at about

81
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,969
94% and this could help with the

82
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,409
anthocyanin production in the crop it's

83
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,150
a nonstick surface so it does allow for

84
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:18,329
easy snow removal and it's very durable

85
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,650
in last 25 years this is kind of what it

86
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:21,930
may look like these are some structures

87
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,099
made out of it because it's a resin and

88
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,930
originates as these kind of little

89
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,810
plastic beads that are melted together

90
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,239
to form this particular covering

91
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,920
material and I provide a little link

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,920
here if you want to check out this

93
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,349
particular one in more detail now

94
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,469
considering coverings insulation ability

95
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:44,150
so this is something worth considering

96
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:46,799
here is the installation of a particular

97
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,000
covering for a greenhouse this is

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,439
important when you're growing in

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,449
particular cold weather

100
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,669
however for plastics having two layers

101
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,039
inflated versus not having them inflated

102
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,589
become a big impact on the insulation or

103
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,419
r-value single plan glasses at our valve

104
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,000
point nine five compared to a double

105
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,199
layer panel point two what this means is

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,509
that the bigger the number the greater

107
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,849
the insulating factor and the less heat

108
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:11,099
you're going to lose now this is an

109
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:14,759
example of insulation but as you can see

110
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,379
there's no light transmission here so we

111
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,069
want to be mindful of that we still want

112
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:21,209
to maintain good insulation ability also

113
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:23,339
good light penetration

114
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,720
therefore double paneling is typically

115
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,779
more efficient choice for greenhouses

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,490
glazed with glass and also poly tunnels

117
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,649
a house would be easily insulated but

118
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,840
again not allowing light throw this is

119
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:35,669
looking at an infrared camera and where

120
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,859
the red and white is you can see a lot

121
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,230
more heat escaping in this case this

122
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,470
Rufus is causing a lot of heat and very

123
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,830
warm in comparison to the sidewalls that

124
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,910
our value that insulation I talked about

125
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:50,729
it's a commercial unit used to measure

126
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,670
effectiveness of thermal insulation how

127
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,129
well does it restrict or resists

128
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,020
conduction of heat the larger the number

129
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,430
of represents a higher insulation value

130
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:02,490
so this is our twenty ones is a very

131
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,709
high value greater healing heating and

132
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,199
cooling efficiency you can see this

133
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:08,699
materials are very high our value

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,039
because it's not allowing the heat from

135
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,879
this blowtorch to ignite any of these

136
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,500
matches lastly here looking at some

137
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,699
greenhouse coverings and installations

138
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,910
and our values looking at some of the

139
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,168
data specific brand names product our

140
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,370
values may vary slightly from these

141
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:25,649
figures but this gives you the general

142
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,740
idea here's a website where I got this

143
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:32,399
from this shows the blower of inflating

144
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,120
and creating a two wall or a double

145
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,349
layer I should say polyethylene

146
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,090
structure you can see the difference

147
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,570
here between double layer inflated our

148
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:45,299
value versus just regular six mil

149
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:46,769
polyethylene in the double or twin walls

150
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,810
you can see the increase so that's

151
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,879
definitely worth consideration even

152
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,110
though it will be increased cost if

153
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,418
you're looking at growing during the

154
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,360
cold months having a high r-value is

155
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:58,769
definitely well worth it if you welcome

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,660
the positive we do here to take a look

157
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:02,519
at this further but this is again

158
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,160
provides you with the journal comparison

159
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,740
of some polycarbonate some polyethylene

160
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,210
and some glass to see the idea of their

161
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,210
insulating or R factor
