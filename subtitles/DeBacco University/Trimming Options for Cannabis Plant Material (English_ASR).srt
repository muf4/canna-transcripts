1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,000
so in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,480
going to go over some trimming options

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,200
we're going to

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:16,960
compare wet trimming versus dry trimming

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:18,480
in this video lecture

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,240
all right let's go over trimming options

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,679
for canvas plant material comparing the

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,959
wet trim where you trim before you go

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,480
through the drying process

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,480
to a dry trim where you're trimming

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,480
after a drying process

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
so looking at these options in more

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,880
detail that wet trimming is the entire

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,960
plants cut down and the buds are removed

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,960
and then are trimmed they're dried all

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,558
in one continuous sequence a lot of

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,359
growers may refer to that as what's

18
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:40,718
called

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,238
bucking up the plants kind of cutting

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,759
down the plants kind of all in one

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,439
fellow swoop there

22
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,960
dry trimming is the plant is cut down

23
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,519
and then hung to dry for a period of

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
time

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,199
typically somewhere in the 5 to 10 day

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,079
range which is followed by the removal

27
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:53,920
of the buds

28
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,119
from the branches after the plant

29
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
material has dried

30
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,759
because you're going to be trimming

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,799
those buds when they're dry this is why

32
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,000
it's referred to

33
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,599
as the dry trimming process now getting

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,159
in a little bit more the pros and cons

35
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,560
of each

36
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,080
if we're looking at wet trimming the

37
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
advantages of wet trimming is that it

38
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,560
can be complete the entire process

39
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,599
in one continuous sequence of steps from

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
cutting down the plant

41
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,599
to trimming the plant this does reduce

42
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
the drying space that's needed so that

43
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,839
can be advantageous for growers that are

44
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,400
drying space limited it also allows for

45
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,079
a tighter

46
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
uh trim since the leaves are basically

47
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,959
flat at that time

48
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,639
there's less damage to the trichomes

49
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,199
because they're not brittly dry there's

50
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,879
a little room for kind of handling air

51
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,040
waste material can be disposed of

52
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,798
immediately however the disadvantage

53
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,960
with wet trimming is the process is time

54
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,159
sensitive as if the plants we want the

55
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,158
plants sitting around waiting for the

56
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,359
trimming phase because the odds of mold

57
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,520
will increase

58
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,478
there's also less room for error with

59
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,078
the wet trim

60
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,840
some would also argue you also may

61
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,000
produce a little lower quality

62
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,759
and flower there with the wet trimming

63
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,519
process compared to

64
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,359
the dry trimming process now when we're

65
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,478
talking about dry trimming it is easier

66
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,799
to clean up

67
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,519
the trimming can be spread out over more

68
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,439
time

69
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,280
there's also less equipment that's

70
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,039
needed with the dry trim process

71
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,878
the disadvantages is there are greater

72
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,560
space requirements to hang those plants

73
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,479
during the drying process

74
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
the plant material is more fragile when

75
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,439
dry compared to when it was wet or

76
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
recently harvested

77
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,318
and the fan leaves typically still need

78
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,759
to be removed so again keep that in mind

79
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,919
that's a good little comparison wet and

80
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,199
dry trimming if you want to learn about

81
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,598
more of these in detail

82
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,359
you can search this channel however some

83
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,399
growers are actually utilizing both of

84
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,040
these methods

85
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
so how do you utilize both methods well

86
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,039
they're combining wet and dry trimming

87
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,280
they're removing fan leaves right before

88
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,679
harvest help reduce the labor later

89
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,199
and speed up the drying process overall

90
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,760
the goal is to maintain the trichome

91
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,199
quality

92
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,799
by having the smaller leaves around the

93
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,359
bud called the sugar leaves

94
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
act as a physical protective barrier

95
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
this allows

96
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,519
the best of both trimming options

97
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,039
combined into one many commercial

98
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,480
growers will trim wet

99
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,158
just to remove some of the bigger fan

100
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,799
leaves and then manicure the buds by

101
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,878
hand

102
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,040
to achieve that kind of boutique style

103
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,079
look that many consumers are expecting

104
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,120
these days

105
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
with when they come to purchasing a high

106
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,719
quality

107
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,719
final dry flour
