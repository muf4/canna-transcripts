00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
on this tobacco university video if

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,759
you're growing plants outdoors

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,679
how do we kind of work on that

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,199
progression from the vegetative

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,959
to the flowering stage where are some

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,558
things we need to keep in mind

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,639
and what are some considerations we

8
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,279
should be making you'll all be presented

9
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,399
here

10
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,399
on this video lecture

11
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,479
[Music]

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,839
all right let's get into outdoor natural

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,118
progression of cannabis

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,719
from vegetative to flowering phases

15
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,479
so first off we have to consider the

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,759
photoperiod which also comes from just

17
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,439
the natural sunlight

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,280
and with outdoor growers plants will

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,679
flower based on the duration of sun that

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
naturally changes with the seasons

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,119
in mid-summer when days become shorter

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
than 12 hours is when

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,878
the photoperiod dependent varieties will

24
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,159
start to flower regardless of the

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,000
plant's age

26
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,198
however be mindful of any light

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
pollution

28
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,878
on the plants which can include but not

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,198
limited to garden lights

30
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,799
street lights or various spotlights that

31
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,920
might offset the plant's

32
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:06,478
natural perception of the photo period

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,920
now timing is key so with outdoor

34
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,000
growing there are set of conditions that

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,519
growers need to plan accordingly

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,040
the calendar will dictate the photo

37
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,840
period and also the

38
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,360
typical weather to be expected so both

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,719
play an important role in canvas plant

40
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,560
morphology development

41
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,798
so we want to make sure our timing is

42
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,280
spot on and everything looks nice and

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,799
good

44
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,519
because if we're off it definitely

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,680
starts to look very awkward

46
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,599
now that calendar so photoperiod

47
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,320
dependent varieties will go into flower

48
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,000
based on

49
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,000
the photoperiod so the timing of the

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
plants needs to be based on day length

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
that's timing based on when you choose

52
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,759
to plant them

53
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,479
autoflowers may not be impacted by the

54
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,239
day length

55
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,759
but there is also the growing season for

56
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,438
many areas which is shorter

57
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
than those that have a winter season so

58
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,000
keep that in mind even though

59
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,399
autoflowers will just

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,159
flower x number of days old we want to

61
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,759
make sure we're maximizing favorable

62
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,399
plant environmental conditions

63
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,280
based on the season season and timing of

64
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,718
the year

65
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,478
timing is important for outdoor growers

66
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,280
that is centered around their chosen

67
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,039
planting date

68
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,718
that's how you can modify what the

69
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,000
plants will be exposed to

70
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,239
so we're looking at photoperiod

71
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,318
dependence we want to take a look at the

72
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,159
calendar growers should look at duration

73
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,598
of time that has over 12 hours of

74
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,878
sunlight and when the critical day

75
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,479
length occurs

76
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,399
planting should occur to ensure that

77
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,439
there's enough time for the vegetative

78
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
growth of the plants

79
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,318
to support quality bud production and a

80
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,319
lot of this depends on your degree of

81
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,439
latitude so you want to be planting too

82
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,878
late in the season and

83
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,719
only allowing plants to go through veg

84
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,560
phase for a very short period of time

85
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,800
keep that in mind look at the calendar

86
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,280
when should your planting date be

87
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
now auto farming plants well they may

88
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,479
not change to flower

89
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,920
production based on the photo period but

90
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,518
there are other factors considered to

91
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,598
maximize your plant production

92
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,360
providing plants with longer days can

93
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,560
help increase plant efficiency

94
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,400
so this needs to be taken into

95
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
consideration along with the local

96
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,840
weather patterns to catch the optimum

97
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,480
growing conditions

98
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,560
so while planting height is in part

99
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,039
determined by the actual variety being

100
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
grown

101
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,719
can also be influenced by the timing of

102
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,238
the planting while a bigger plant can

103
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,479
theoretically at least produce more

104
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,319
yield a tall plant can be more

105
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,399
likely to become wind damaged late in

106
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,158
the season this is common areas near

107
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,280
coastlines that may get tropical storms

108
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,359
or hurricanes

109
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
so again take that into consideration as

110
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,519
well

111
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,319
lastly staking or plan of plant support

112
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,480
structures

113
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,359
for outdoor production plant supports

114
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,079
are an option

115
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,959
but this may be more applicable to small

116
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,319
growers

117
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
also the material you should be

118
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,639
considered as typically plants can get

119
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,759
quite large and require strong supports

120
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,759
which is often used with metal rebar

121
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,719
it can also depend on your pruning style

122
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,919
if you're going in large scale

123
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,560
production you may not be doing a lot of

124
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,158
pruning

125
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,400
if you're growing a smaller operation

126
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,479
outdoors pruning might be an option

127
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,840
screen of green might be another worth

128
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,919
consideration

129
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,759
we are laying out a bunch of trellis

130
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,079
netting allowing plants to grow up

131
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,798
to only keep them to maximize production

132
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
per plant

133
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,400
but to also provide some physical

134
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,480
support so take these all

135
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
and options into consideration when

136
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,560
growing cannabis plants

137
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,560
outdoors
