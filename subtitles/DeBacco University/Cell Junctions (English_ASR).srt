1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
okay this is a short video lecture on

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,569
cell Junction there's three major ones

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:09,539
we're going to go over so starting with

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,669
the first one tight junctions this is a

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,829
specialized connection of two adjacent

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,469
animal cell membranes usually

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,710
eliminating space see here's our tight

8
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,519
junctions really close together

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,769
basically you can think of them kind of

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,250
like fusing together super tight

11
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:27,839
junctions looming in a space in this

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,759
case we're two hands to be touching here

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,890
here are tight junctions that we're

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,109
looking at basically eliminating that

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,109
space set that may be present there

16
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:42,299
desmosomes is the other form of cells

17
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,640
the cell Junction a structure by which

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,738
two adjacent cells are attached forms

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,140
with protein plates in the cell

20
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:50,909
membranes linked by filaments these

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,289
function like rivets so if you've seen

22
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:56,909
the underside of like a bridge the

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,219
bridge will have rivets these little

24
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:01,439
areas here are rivets and that's kind of

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,890
the same concept that's occurring here

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,959
our desmosomes have these rivet like

27
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,909
structures or these structures

28
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,688
homologous to the rivets that hold up

29
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:17,310
the bridge to be able to adhere one cell

30
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:19,349
to another cell the last form of cell

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,969
junctions would be gap junctions in the

32
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:22,709
animal cells these are specialized

33
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,590
intracellular connections that join the

34
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:28,589
satellizer of two cells we see here is

35
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,159
one cell down here this gap junction is

36
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,020
this little kind of protein like channel

37
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,780
allowing communication to occur from the

38
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:39,030
lower cell through the upper cell now in

39
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,829
animal cells are called gap junctions

40
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,290
however in plant cells they have a

41
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:44,188
different name they're called plus

42
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,320
plasma des Matta

43
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,029
their channels through the cell walls

44
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,339
remember plant cells have the cell wall

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,290
that allows molecules and substances to

46
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,850
move freely as needed this is

47
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,899
advantageous for the cells so it reduces

48
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:59,459
the energy when it's looking to move

49
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:01,769
particular nutrients or could be waste

50
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,929
products or signals from one cell to

51
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,188
another they look just like this they're

52
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,399
holes in the cell wall these

53
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,989
plasmodesmata are holes however while

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,979
this is great in allows things to move

55
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,930
freely viruses really enjoy plasma does

56
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:19,679
in the sense that they can move through

57
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,530
a leaf structure very quickly and this

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,780
is one of the downfall so plasmodesmata

59
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,699
remember the same basic structure of

60
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,680
kurzon plant cells as possible desmona

61
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,268
and as animal cells as gap junctions

62
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,250
even though they're basically the same

63
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,430
thing plant cells have that cell wall

64
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,848
that nice comparison between these three

65
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,799
here

66
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:39,389
remember gap junctions providing the

67
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:41,629
cytoplasmic channels from one cell to

68
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:43,889
adjacent cells for communication

69
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:45,628
desmosomes are function like rivets

70
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:48,809
fastening cells together in our strong

71
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:50,578
sheets in our tape junctions rotate

72
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,959
junctions our membranes at adjacent

73
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:54,959
cells are very tightly bonded together

74
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,359
forming seals around the cells these are

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,289
some examples of the three main types of

76
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,290
cell junctions
