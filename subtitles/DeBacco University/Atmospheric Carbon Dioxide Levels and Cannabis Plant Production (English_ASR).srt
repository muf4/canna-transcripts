1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,759
so you want to grow your cannabis plants

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,879
that normal atmospheric levels of carbon

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,719
dioxide

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,638
that doesn't require any additional

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,039
enrichment plants have been doing just

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,039
fine

7
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,119
on this level of carbon dioxide for many

8
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,959
many many years all outdoor plants

9
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,559
are subject to atmospheric levels

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,609
however there's a couple things you

11
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,299
should keep in mind

12
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,300
[Music]

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,160
so let's look at growing plants

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,839
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,600
related to cannabis production

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,359
can we talk about atmospheric conditions

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,239
they have been on the rise here we can

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,640
see some

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,919
circulation but overall we do see a kind

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,439
of in this example

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,079
kind of an increase here a linear

22
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,399
progression running around that kind of

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,439
around that 400 ish parts per million

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,399
would be considered

25
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,280
atmospheric levels now as i said i'm

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,280
going to use at

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,039
400 parts per million to be that normal

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,320
atmospheric levels

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,320
keep in mind that cannabis has been

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,000
grown atmospheric levels carbon accident

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,920
for thousands of years

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
all outdoor plants that's what they're

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,920
subject to this can produce quality

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,438
yields assuming no other factors are

35
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
limiting and as i said atmospheric

36
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,399
conditions

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,320
are on the rise and they are varying

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
year to year

39
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,959
so if we are growing in atmospheric

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
conditions something you want to keep in

41
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,319
mind

42
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,240
is air circulation so by simply

43
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,158
circulating air around the canvas plant

44
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,519
a grower can deliver 400 parts million

45
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
of carbon dioxide

46
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,438
fans and air circulation are important

47
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,438
components of any growing environment

48
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,959
so this supplementation of carbon oxide

49
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,279
comes as a bonus

50
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,798
you don't want to have the arb stagnant

51
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
because plants can consume

52
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,079
the carbon dioxide and actually reduce

53
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,680
those levels

54
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,199
so by circulating air particularly

55
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,799
bringing outside air in

56
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,799
is a great way to ensure they're

57
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,360
constantly getting that normal

58
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,640
about 400 parts per million atmospheric

59
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,679
levels

60
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,239
they're growing plants at these

61
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,600
atmospheric levels and there's no need

62
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,478
for any additional equipment

63
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,000
or monitoring devices this makes a very

64
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:58,478
easy grow and this could be an indoor

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,159
grow

66
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,359
this could also be an outdoor grow

67
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,920
probably a little easier in the outdoor

68
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,679
grow but

69
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,439
even indoor grow keep that air moving

70
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
keep bringing air out from the outside

71
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,839
in

72
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,759
to ensure your growing environment is at

73
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,360
least at atmospheric levels because it

74
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,878
extends plant canopies can cause that to

75
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,560
drop below

76
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,399
now there are some challenges with

77
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,318
atmospheric conditions

78
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,599
if air ventilation is not sufficient

79
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,759
while plants are consuming

80
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,679
large quantities of carbon dioxide this

81
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,479
can cause those carbon dioxide levels to

82
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,400
drop below

83
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,840
atmospheric conditions which is around

84
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000
400 parts per million

85
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,878
if levels drop below 250 parts per

86
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,878
million or

87
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,959
lower this will actually result in plant

88
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,799
stunting with no monitor it can be

89
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,640
difficult to know if this happens

90
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
so just constantly keep air moving

91
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,039
around now we see the kind of the

92
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,519
example here with

93
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,120
a lettuce crop many crops like lettuce

94
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,239
can benefit from supplementation of

95
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,400
carbon dioxide

96
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
plant on the left received less than 400

97
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
parts per million

98
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,280
then the plant below here received 500

99
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,680
parts which again is above atmospheric

100
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,000
levels but we can see this difference

101
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,879
here at least visually

102
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,360
now for indoor conditions keep in mind

103
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,158
with

104
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,760
indoor indoors lighting needs to be

105
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,840
supplemented as well

106
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,518
if only using atmospheric conditions

107
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
lower light intensities can potentially

108
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,719
be

109
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
used because even under 400 parts plant

110
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,598
of carbon dioxide

111
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
plants will be correctly limited if

112
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,399
given higher which is considered above

113
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,680
my

114
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,439
900 micro moles of light levels

115
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,040
so just keep that in mind that if you're

116
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,199
seeing different lights for sale and

117
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,199
high intensity light

118
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,359
it may recommend with carbon dioxide

119
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,679
because plants at atmospheric levels

120
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
can not really use much above 900

121
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,239
micromoles

122
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,759
so these atmospheric levels

123
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,360
normal atmospheric levels can produce

124
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,719
good yields as growers have been working

125
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,159
with this for many years

126
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,840
however this should be considered the

127
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,679
standard or control

128
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,598
production levels because if you add

129
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,840
carbon dioxide you have the potential

130
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,839
to increase your yields from here
