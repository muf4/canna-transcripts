1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
so while the use of electronic

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,150
cigarettes has been on the rise found

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:10,410
some alarming facts and I want to share

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,330
with you regarding their usage so more

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,460
than 2-million middle and high school

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,289
students were current users of attract

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,210
cigarettes now it's just kind of an

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,330
alarming fact when clearly they're not

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,670
for sale to minors 11% of high school

10
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,009
and 4.3 percent of middle school

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,050
students are recurrent users of

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,150
e-cigarettes in 2006 based on the

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,980
information that I found and I've

14
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,808
included links at the bottom here so

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,420
remember the in the description you can

16
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:39,628
go to the slides pause it and direct

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,030
copy the URL into your chosen web

18
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:45,929
browser what's interesting now is

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,579
according to 2013 new 2014 survey eighty

20
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,850
one percent of current youths see

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,039
cigarette users cited availability of

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,800
appealing flavors as the primary reason

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,500
for their use so that's a little bit of

24
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,419
a concern when we're looking at how

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,019
these are being marketed and who they're

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,329
being potentially marketed to so let's

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,460
get to like the Surgeon General and the

28
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,709
American Lung Association their feelings

29
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,688
on these well the US Surgeon General

30
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,239
concluded that e-cigarettes can expose

31
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:19,469
users to several potentially harmful

32
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:22,789
chemicals more than just the nicotine we

33
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:26,039
might associate with the term cigarette

34
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,450
carboxyl groups of all volatile organic

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,460
compounds are just some of the other

36
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,159
harmful chemicals that you might be

37
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,889
exposed to if you're choosing to use

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,640
these the American Lung Association as a

39
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,500
result supports basically prohibiting

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,689
the use of e-cigarettes in work sites

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,239
and public places including e-cigarettes

42
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:48,209
under smoke-free laws with other tobacco

43
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,069
products the reason for this is they

44
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,169
remain concerned about their impact on

45
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:56,819
public health given a dramatic increase

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,618
in use especially among the youth these

47
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,859
cigarettes are our tobacco product in

48
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,379
the youth youth are using e-cigarettes

49
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:06,750
increasing and actually an alarming rate

50
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:09,060
the information I found again URL found

51
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,288
at the bottom here at the US Surgeon

52
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,709
General found a cigarettes

53
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,889
among high school students increased by

54
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,240
900

55
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:19,679
percent from just 2011 to 2015 it was

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,930
the most current date and I can find

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,840
with more teams now using e-cigarettes

58
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,610
and cigarettes now that reason is

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,640
potentials being glamorized more also

60
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:35,550
marketing of these cigarettes could be

61
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,349
more directed to youth because they're

62
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,000
offering like candy flavors like bubble

63
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,090
gum and gummy bears which are typically

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,560
appealing to a younger audience so this

65
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,409
is just something we're noticing a

66
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,840
dramatic increase of however there is

67
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:51,539
definitely some associate risk with this

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,580
so if you are considering this as a

69
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,889
cleaner or better alternative to

70
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,320
traditional cigarettes you may want to

71
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:00,629
think twice even though it is being

72
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,389
increased in the amount of use that

73
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:06,180
we're seeing across the nation the scary

74
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:09,089
part is it's being used at a much higher

75
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,500
rate amongst youth such as middle sadly

76
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,500
and even high school students
