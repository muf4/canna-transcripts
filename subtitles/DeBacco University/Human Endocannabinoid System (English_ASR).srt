1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,278
so on this debaco university video go

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:08,080
over the human endocannabinoid system

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:11,080
how it relates to the cb1 and cb2

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,080
receptors

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,800
[Music]

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,039
all right so focusing on these receptors

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
is as a side note the cb2 receptor here

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,279
is involved with the immune system found

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,960
in the thalamus and the cb1 receptor is

10
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,239
in the brain there so we're going to

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,679
talk about two different locations

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,879
within the body

13
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:32,479
so realize that there are different

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,238
types of cannabinoids and a lot of

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,919
people get hung up on just one or two

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,718
that they like to focus on we realize

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,160
there are many types and you know we've

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,079
got the side chain of all right there's

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,159
a whole bunch of different types here

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,878
these are produced not only by cannabis

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,640
so keep that in mind as well that

22
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,039
cannabis does produce these but there's

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,520
other plants in fungi and other species

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,359
basically that do produce these as well

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
liverworts for example rhododendron are

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,000
just some examples cannabinoids are

27
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,079
defined generally as specific species of

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,679
terpenoids molecules that has the

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,760
potential to interact with the

30
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,400
endocannabinoid system typically

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,840
abbreviate ecs

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
now don't forget about the terpenes

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,520
remember also some terpenes that

34
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,560
interact with the endocannabinoid system

35
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,959
as well

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,439
one established example of this effect

37
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:23,280
is the beta carothylene which has been

38
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,519
identified as a cb2 agonist acting as an

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,478
allergistic way to suppress the

40
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,399
suppressor of neural inflammation and

41
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,400
with this property this makes it a

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,040
candidate for the treatment of multiple

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,880
sclerosis remember an agonist is going

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,439
to allow for the activation of the

45
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,920
binding and activation of that molecule

46
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,959
and antagonist is going to either lessen

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,719
that activation or block it entirely

48
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,199
now cannabis are inside of you your own

49
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,359
body contains a system of anginas

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,960
receptors and ligands which work to

51
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,719
regulate a vast number of cellular

52
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,280
functions in tissues throughout your

53
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,359
body they do play a vital role with

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,000
these cannabinoids in maintaining

55
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,840
homeostasis so they are very important

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,759
keep in mind here looking at the graphic

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,920
we are talking about the synapse area

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,479
here which is that area between those

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,280
two neurons and this does work on a

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,560
negative feedback loop system

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,759
at least two of these cannabis produced

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,800
by your own body are called anamide

63
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,079
which is

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,680
an analog to the thc molecule and this

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
really long name here two

66
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,520
aractodontylglycerol

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,239
is an analog and a degenerace analog to

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,519
the cbd molecule both produced by

69
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,840
cannabis

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
now specifically for these receptors and

71
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,159
try to provide a nice little graphics

72
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,839
here to try to separate out the two

73
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,159
target regions and classify them a

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,319
little bit more for this cb1 and cb2

75
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,079
receptors as

76
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,399
these do determine the behavioral

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,800
effects when it's consumed by the

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,680
individual as well the effects of your

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
own body to these cannabis receptors so

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,719
it's these receptors that is the reason

81
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,559
why

82
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,239
different people may have different

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,199
after effects or

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,959
different responses to this because of

85
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,000
their receptors might be slightly

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,920
different from one individual to another

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,158
now looking here just highlight here the

88
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,839
cb1 receptor

89
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,079
they are expressed most densely in the

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,598
central nervous system and are largely

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,920
responsible for the meeting of the

92
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,238
effects of the cannabinoid binding to

93
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,958
the brain there so there's a lot of

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,120
depolarization going on it has to result

95
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,080
in a decrease neither glutamate or a

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,599
gaba release which are examples of

97
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,599
neurotransmitters so with this research

98
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,399
when we're looking at the cb1

99
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,158
receptor and they're kind of in

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
inhibitory effects

101
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,959
it's looking like that this receptor

102
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,680
might be able to inhibit or play a role

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,400
in inhibiting neurotransmitter release

104
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,360
in general looking at the physiology of

105
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,840
this particular cb1 receptor

106
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,280
now in contrast if we look at cb2 here

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,479
remember these are found in the immune

108
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,199
cells particularly cells of the

109
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:04,479
macrophage lineage these receptors only

110
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,318
indirectly affect neural neural function

111
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,840
modulating cb2 signaling could be

112
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,679
promising for the treatment of various

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
inflammatory conditions

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,120
so that's an important note to keep in

115
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,959
mind and this is why we need more

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
research on this topic

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,319
now kind of tying this all in another

118
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,639
kind of graphic here looking at the

119
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,759
human endocannabinoid system

120
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,199
thc cbd and cbn again we're talking at

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,960
the neurotransmitter level these

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,680
chemicals and how they interact with

123
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,079
both the brain as well as you know the

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,560
immune system so there's a lot that goes

125
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,639
on this is a very complex system and

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,280
hopefully with more research we'll be

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,280
able to understand this even better
