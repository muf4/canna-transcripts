1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
okay here we're gonna look at some of

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,859
the details in the animal phyla we can

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,820
see everything from sponges to Nigerians

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,789
to whales to see stars to worms all fit

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,940
into this very large and diverse phyla

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,108
that we might be most familiar with so

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,929
first off looking at the general

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,390
features of animals and I can kind of

9
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:27,410
fit myself in the mix here kind of put

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,349
myself right there because I do qualify

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,210
as do all humans here so animals aren't

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,030
heterotrophs meaning they do not make

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,410
their own food need to consume it plants

14
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,379
and autotrophs are the ones that would

15
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,250
make their own food animals do not

16
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:43,890
multi-cell there so they have a

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,719
mitochondria but lack a cell wall as a

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,549
result animal cells can be quite

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,980
flexible they can move from place to

20
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,140
place they're deployed they have diverse

21
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,509
forms and habitats as we can just see

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,399
from the image here we produce mostly by

23
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,799
sexual reproduction have a common

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,308
pattern of development and have unique

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:05,548
tissues so general features all the

26
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:08,250
animals in vertebrates account for 99%

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,890
of all species in the animal kingdom

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,489
most occur actually in the c3 phyla

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,219
dominate animal life on earth arthropod

30
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:19,978
a and mollusk and chordates so while we

31
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,450
may think of kind of you know our most

32
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:25,140
favorite animals or what we think is the

33
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,118
most kind of common arthropod is by far

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,140
the greatest and invertebrates account

35
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:34,618
for 99% of all species so just be

36
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,430
mindful of that of how well one percent

37
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,188
of vertebrates

38
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,130
there's chordates are very very small

39
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:44,489
total amount of species so looking at

40
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:46,560
the family tree animals consists of 35

41
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:48,509
very different phyla textiles

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,750
traditionally have compared anatomical

43
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,180
features the end result though is

44
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:56,670
biologies so we're looking at the domain

45
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,399
kingdom phylum class order family genus

46
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,129
and species you're looking at the phyla

47
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,049
level so we're looking here kind of at

48
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,739
this bar here and working to be more

49
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,469
specific

50
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:09,149
so all animals in this case are in the

51
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:10,919
kingdom Animalia and are all in the

52
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,000
domain Eukarya and we're looking at

53
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,269
separating out that phyla

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,210
more specific so within this animal

55
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,400
family tree here the traditional animal

56
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,340
ecology is being revised molecular

57
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,819
systemics systematics you should say are

58
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,400
used uses unique gene sequences to

59
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:32,379
detect relatedness and construct cell

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,840
genetic trees we're getting away from

61
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:38,139
the phenotypic features and getting more

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,479
into the genotypic features as a result

63
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:43,059
has recruited new divisions and new ways

64
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,799
to divide different things to really see

65
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,920
what is connected looking at the

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,290
genetics of those now the current look

67
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,729
here we can kind of see are having

68
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:54,429
tissues are notitia so this would be our

69
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:55,810
common ancestor way down here no tissues

70
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,050
going off to the left tissues going off

71
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,479
to the right so everything here

72
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,130
including or having tissues sponges or

73
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,840
peripheral and not including tissues

74
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,150
within there we can have a radial

75
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,310
symmetry or bilateral symmetry we're

76
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,830
looking at a whole bunch of different

77
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,759
other ways to divide things there's

78
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,260
animals malt

79
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,269
they have protostome development or due

80
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:18,879
to sperm development different ways

81
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,600
again to kind of separate things and

82
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,979
classify them well lastly they cladogram

83
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,479
with key branch points this gives you

84
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:28,209
another idea of a way to break things

85
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,909
apart looking at having vertebra having

86
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,159
jaws or lungs or four limbs and legs or

87
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:34,629
a mitotic egg how would they how would

88
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,930
things be separated and what would be

89
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:39,969
considered to be more complex so well

90
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,709
this is a very diverse a phylum that we

91
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,329
might be familiar with this hopefully

92
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,189
makes it a little bit easier to at least

93
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:47,620
associate some of the physical features

94
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:51,090
when we're looking at developing branch

95
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,090
points within that phyla
