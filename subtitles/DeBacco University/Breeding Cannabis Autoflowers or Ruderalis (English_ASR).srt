1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,318
all right in this tobacco university

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,399
video we'll be tackling the challenging

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,439
subject of breeding cannabis autoflowers

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,480
or rudolus

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,719
we'll get to see some of the

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,798
complexities and why it's so

7
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,160
difficult but hopefully through this

8
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,079
video you'll develop a greater

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,839
understanding for the process

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,358
so first off the advantage of

11
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,759
autoflowers is

12
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,359
breeders use these genetics to create

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,039
plants that grow fast typically around

14
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,880
70 days from start to finish

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,039
without the need to having to change the

16
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,038
day length it's simply based on the

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,840
number of calendar days

18
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,760
so that can be an advantage to many

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,239
growers both outdoors as well as

20
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,799
indoors not having to worry about the

21
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,839
photo period their plants are under

22
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,959
so the trait of auto flowering is

23
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,000
recessive and it's a simple treat

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,079
for growers and breeders to observe

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,679
you grow a bunch of plants under a 12-12

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,359
hour light cycle that's 12 hours of

27
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,439
light 12 hours of darkness

28
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,280
and if it stays vegetative in the early

29
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,238
growing then that is definitely an

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,039
autoflower

31
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,799
and not a photoperiod dependent trait

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,159
such as you would have with an indica or

33
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,959
sativa recessive does not mean bad or

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,240
negative

35
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,559
it does mean that the plant needs two

36
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,640
copies one from the material and one

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,320
from the parental line in order for the

38
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,759
trait to be expressed

39
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,438
so this is an important note there if we

40
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,439
go back to our little punnett squares

41
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,000
for that recessive gene to be expressed

42
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,000
we would need two copies in this example

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,519
yellow would be recessive green would be

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,118
dominant we could see in order to get

45
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,200
that yellow coloration

46
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,640
we need two copies of that recessive

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,680
allele

48
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,560
now back crossing basics in the breeding

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
process

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,000
so back crossing is a crossing of a

51
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,920
hybrid with one of its parents

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,599
or an individual genetically similar to

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,159
its parent in order to achieve

54
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,519
offspring with a genetic identity which

55
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,320
is closer to that

56
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,158
of the parent back cross hybrids are

57
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,599
sometimes described with the acronym

58
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,600
bc for example an f1 hybrid crossed with

59
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,679
one of its parents

60
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,759
or genetically similar individual can be

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,719
termed

62
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,399
bc1 and you'll see that some of the

63
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,879
images here are hybrid

64
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,560
and a further cross of the bc1 hybrid to

65
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,439
the same parent or genetically similar

66
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,280
individual again produces the bc2 hybrid

67
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,120
this breeding process is more restricted

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,598
to recessive traits

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,959
and we see that kind of bc1 bc2

70
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,839
terminology here

71
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,120
we're seeing a shift in that population

72
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
so let's take a look at continued

73
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,000
examples of this back crossing

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,520
so this back crossing it follows shown

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,878
pattern of inheritance

76
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,640
keep in mind that breeding autoflowers

77
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,560
is a true breeding photo

78
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,159
dependent variety we're all looking at

79
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,640
the patterns that are forming we see

80
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,639
that bc1bc2 formation

81
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,958
all the offspring will be heterozygotes

82
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,958
which means they all be photoperiod

83
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,400
dependent so keep that in mind if you

84
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,400
take an autoflower and bring with a true

85
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,159
breeding photo period dependent

86
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,159
all the offspring going to be

87
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,759
photoperiod dependent why is that that

88
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,639
is a dominant trait

89
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,000
however it's important also to note that

90
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,318
all of the offspring will be

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,400
carriers for the autoflowering tree this

92
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,439
is the f1 generation and we're going to

93
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,080
go through and breed

94
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,439
from there so again this is where things

95
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,959
initially might skip that first

96
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,039
generation so don't panic

97
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,800
bring it again will then start to bring

98
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,280
that trait out

99
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,959
so we breathe that f1 with the f1 this

100
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
follows the pattern shown of inheritance

101
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,280
offspring of the desired trait will be

102
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,479
needed

103
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,000
and selected for 75 percent will be

104
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,119
photoperiod dependent since it's a

105
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,560
dominant trait

106
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,799
25 will be autoflowers this is the f2

107
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,759
generation we kind of see that here

108
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,480
again with the

109
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,120
breeding of the chickens we have that

110
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,878
original

111
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
we have that kind of back crossing that

112
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,878
same parent coming back again

113
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,680
we can see the how the percentages are

114
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,639
shifting

115
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,560
as we go from our f1 or f2 to f3 or f4

116
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,079
generation

117
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,759
now if we're looking here specifically

118
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
we give the examples of

119
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,359
mice and the same thing to be applied to

120
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,878
cannabis as well this continued breeding

121
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,599
and selecting will increase the amount

122
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,438
of autoflowers within the population

123
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,119
keep in mind you may also want to watch

124
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,438
for other plant characteristics

125
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,120
such as the morphology the chemical

126
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,680
chemical profiles as well as many other

127
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
things

128
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,040
to ensure you do not produce an

129
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,919
autoflower that does not offer any other

130
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,359
benefits

131
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,119
be great if you go through a breeding

132
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
autoflower but if it's got the

133
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,680
autoflower

134
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,000
treat and characteristic but nothing

135
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,160
else then it's not really worth it

136
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,519
often this is done for five to nine

137
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,639
generations because you get a more

138
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,160
stabilization

139
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,400
in this case of that recessive or

140
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,880
autoflower gene we see the same thing

141
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,399
here we're breeding some together we get

142
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,719
we get some offspring we get that

143
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,758
transgenic mouse we keep coming back to

144
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,360
this line

145
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,800
breed those together we discard a

146
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
certain percentage that don't have the

147
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,960
trait we want

148
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,519
we then breed those together with the

149
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,799
same original parent and go through

150
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,879
so on and so forth i do that for

151
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
multiple generations you can see that

152
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,000
first time we only have about

153
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,120
25 autoflowers and 50 then 75 and 87 and

154
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,519
a half 93.75

155
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,519
96.8 98.3 99 plus

156
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,719
we're kind of getting that vast and

157
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,680
quick ramp up

158
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,440
increase in the amount of autoflowers

159
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,879
again this can get kind of complicated

160
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,120
and hopefully i'm

161
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,560
providing with some information and some

162
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,399
graphs that you can kind of look at and

163
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
kind of go back and study

164
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,000
many traits are poly genetic meaning

165
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,759
there are multiple genes involved with

166
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,319
the observed phenotype or how that

167
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,080
individual looks while the basic rules

168
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,360
of dominant recessive still

169
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,839
play a role in the combination of

170
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,479
multiple genes will result in what is

171
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,079
observed

172
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,758
in the final product so it's important

173
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,038
again to keep that in mind

174
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,240
this is why it may take more than simply

175
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,159
three generations to create that

176
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,759
stabilized autoflowering trait

177
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
but the basics still hold true and

178
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,680
should provide a good starting point

179
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,198
and kind of that example i gave with the

180
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,038
mice we kind of see that example here

181
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,038
with the multiple back crosses

182
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:47,199
going to 50 to 75 to 87.5 to 93.75

183
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,879
you're getting kind of this curve here

184
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,120
you're not quite reaching that 100

185
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,719
but you're getting very very close as

186
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,759
that's kind of progressing

187
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
um there the percentage of the original

188
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,080
heterozygosity

189
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,038
that is homozygous in all future

190
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,560
generations

191
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,079
so if you only did it for kind of that

192
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,439
three generations you still would have a

193
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,599
pretty good mix

194
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,279
um that kind of as i mentioned five to

195
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,759
nine is typically what's done

196
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,719
that you can do it potentially longer as

197
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,960
long as you keep

198
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,400
keep in mind and remember to also look

199
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,638
at other traits more than just

200
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,719
autoflower to make sure that you're not

201
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,160
getting some sort of strange mutation in

202
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
the morphology of the plant

203
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,560
or something else that is undesirable

204
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
you're carrying over that auto flowering

205
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,038
trait

206
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,639
along with other desirable traits to

207
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:33,038
create a very unique

208
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,038
and hopefully sought after genetic line
