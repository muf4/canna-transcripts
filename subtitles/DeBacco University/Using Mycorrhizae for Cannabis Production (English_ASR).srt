1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,480
have you considered using microrise and

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,359
part of your cannabis plant production

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,440
process

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:17,278
well tune in to this debaco university

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:18,320
video to learn more

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,719
all right let's get into using

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,278
mycorrhizae for cannabis production

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,559
so first off what is mycorrhizae well it

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,039
literally means kind of

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,038
a fungus of the root and describes a

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,000
mutually beneficial relationship between

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,239
the plant and root

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,759
fungus so what's happening is where

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,640
roots grow they're able to absorb

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,640
nutrients

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,079
but when they have the advantage of the

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,239
mycorrhizae

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,160
fungal hyphae they can stretch out and

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,799
they can have access to a greater

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,199
portion

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,399
of soil greater portion of substrate so

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
they can pull in more water

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,320
and nutrients the soil fungal filaments

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480
are colonized in this

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,359
soil area here and they also colonize

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,359
with the roots

27
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,960
they improve nutrient water absorption

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,479
greater than the roots can without this

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,558
symbiotic relationship

30
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,558
approximately 95 percent of plant

31
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,798
species on the planet form a symbiotic

32
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,319
relationship with the mycorrhizae fungus

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,159
now the reason why this is called a

34
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,000
symbiotic relationship

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,000
is while the plant is getting more

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,920
nutrients the fungus is collecting more

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,118
and giving more nutrients to the plant

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,200
the fungus has to get something in

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,799
return the fungus is able to get sugars

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
from the plant because it has leaves

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,720
above the soil surface so it can

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,239
photosynthesize so this mutual

43
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,840
relationship is the fungus says i'll

44
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,280
give you nutrients and the plant says

45
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,000
i'll give you sugars and this is why

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
they both

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,560
benefit there's a lot of products that

48
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,319
come inoculated with mycorrhizae so

49
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,519
mycorrhizae can be found added to many

50
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,359
products and there are even products

51
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,438
that contain concentrated levels

52
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,118
for growers to make specific additions

53
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:41,839
particularly if they're doing clones or

54
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:43,840
seedlings

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
then go through and add inoculants of

56
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,799
these mycorrhizae products

57
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,879
as well as some products coming

58
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,640
pre-inoculated with them this is due to

59
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,839
customer demand and state benefits of

60
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,359
this fungus can have

61
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,799
on plants however i often just one word

62
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,478
of caution when we're looking at

63
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,320
mycorrhizae

64
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,000
cannabis grown in mycorrhizae inoculates

65
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,559
soils with cadmium

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,200
nickel and chromium four have been shown

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
too

68
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,280
and quote significantly enhanced the

69
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
translocation of

70
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,479
all of the three metals of the from the

71
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,878
root

72
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,000
to shoot the possibility to increase

73
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,199
metal accumulation

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,360
in shoot is very interesting uh for

75
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,839
phyto extraction purposes since most

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,720
high production biomass plants

77
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,479
such as non-mycorrhized hemp retain most

78
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,959
heavy metals in the roots

79
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,159
limiting their application so this is

80
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,759
the reference article here if you want

81
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,359
to look at it in more detail

82
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,199
but this is showing that mycorrhizae has

83
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,280
the potential to increase the

84
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,759
translocation of some heavy metals

85
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,840
from just the root structure into the

86
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,479
shoots and upper portions of the plant

87
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,878
so again

88
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,518
just a word of caution there now the

89
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:49,120
benefits

90
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800
if you're adding mycorrhizae to cannabis

91
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
in general in growing substrates they're

92
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
heavily amended and typically

93
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,719
aggressively fed throughout the growing

94
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,479
cycle

95
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,039
the benefits of adding mycorrhizae are

96
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,318
likely reduced below economic returns

97
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,400
meaning if you're feeding the plants

98
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,679
anyway with a lot of water

99
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,680
and water that contains nutrient

100
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,200
solutions the demand

101
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
for the plant to try to have to go out

102
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,839
and scavenge for those nutrients are

103
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,759
going to be reduced

104
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,039
therefore the true benefit of having

105
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,280
mycorrhizae might be

106
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,199
reduced as well however there'll be no

107
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,039
harm come from adding this fungus to

108
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,719
growers must determine if it's worth the

109
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,799
added cost when it comes to return

110
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,080
on investment so again it's just

111
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,680
something else to consider

112
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,040
while it can help the plant gather more

113
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,959
nutrients if you're doing a heavy

114
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,039
feeding of those plants anyway

115
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
the true benefits of adding mycorrhizae

116
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,959
might be reduced

117
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,959
as well
