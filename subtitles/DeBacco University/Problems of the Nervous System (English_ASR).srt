1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
here we're gonna learn about some

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,548
problems of the nervous system that you

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,669
either may have sadly been familiar

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:11,460
yourself or know someone that may have

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,839
had one of these this kind of occurs

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,199
when the nervous system doesn't work

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:18,118
100% right we're starting with the first

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,970
one very common for people playing

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,379
sports or concussions the temporary

10
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,089
disturbance of the brain's ability to

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,939
function and due to a hard blow to the

12
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,589
head so what's happening here is in this

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,528
case we have the head reaching a nice

14
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,549
hard object here and as traumatic brain

15
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,609
injury changes the way the brain

16
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,589
functions is soft tissue that the brain

17
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:40,890
is made of causing the brain to jolt

18
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,859
forward ultimately causes a shift in the

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,700
brain and it can cause injury to occur

20
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,929
this injury could be very minimal

21
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,329
bruising or very minimal swelling

22
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:54,659
tearing the blood vessels but if it's

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,179
pretty intense this can lead to greater

24
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,558
and greater concern so most concussions

25
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,019
are mild and can be treated with

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,339
appropriate care but if it's a severe in

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,780
cushon this is why there's concussions

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,390
protocols and a lot of sporting events

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,849
now it's a severe concussion it can

30
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,099
cause a longer term effects it's left

31
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,269
untreated some of games that are

32
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,829
associated with concussions and

33
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:14,329
particularly as footballs being number

34
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:17,519
one

35
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,259
this shows football leads the way and

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,868
high school concussions other sports

37
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,909
pose risk as well below are the rates of

38
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:26,519
concussions per at the per hundred

39
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,130
thousand games and practices nationally

40
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,810
so footballs the highest boys hockey

41
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:33,509
boys ice hockey star next highest

42
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,329
followed by boys lacrosse holiday girls

43
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:39,269
lacrosse girls soccer boys wrestling and

44
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:41,368
girls field hockey with Mike footballs

45
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:43,828
typically such high it's a very contact

46
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:47,099
oriented sport and there's a lot of that

47
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:49,048
abrupt stopping here so tackling that

48
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,478
occurs as a result they've tried to

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,450
design helmets and put protocols in

50
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:57,170
place to reduce the occurrence and the

51
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,579
impact of concussions have on players

52
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,259
paralysis is another form it's a loss of

53
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,809
sensation in movement of part of the

54
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,569
body due to an injury the spinal cord or

55
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,689
brain keeping the mind the higher the

56
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,579
damage occurs on the spinal cord the

57
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,659
greater amount of impact it will have on

58
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,600
the body if it's lower

59
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:18,729
in the spinal cord here lower parts of

60
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,650
the body would be affected high occurs

61
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:24,629
in the spinal cord if you think about it

62
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:27,400
from that point on South is where the

63
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,379
paralysis could occur this is why for

64
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,700
especially for car accidents want to

65
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,400
maintain especially this upper portion

66
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:35,560
as intact as possible because the higher

67
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,260
up that damage occurs the more of that

68
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,520
body that will be affected Parkinson's

69
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,199
disease is when the brain doesn't

70
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,810
produce enough of the neurotransmitter

71
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,419
that transmits messages from the brain

72
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,939
to muscles so symptoms are tremors rigid

73
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:51,519
muscles shuffle walking and loss of

74
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:54,189
facial expression see here a healthy

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,560
brain a Parkinson's selling affected

76
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:59,169
brain we see the reduction in any amount

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,530
of neurotransmitters being produced keep

78
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:01,179
in mind

79
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,090
normal neuron would produce this many

80
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,879
Elan for normal movement here's a person

81
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:10,450
affected with Parkinson's disease we see

82
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,979
our dopamine produces much reduced even

83
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:14,139
though the number of receptors are the

84
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:17,049
same simply having a reduced amount of

85
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:20,319
dopamine reduces the amount of receiving

86
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:23,680
of that signal causing a poor movement

87
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,509
of the person's muscles continuing on we

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,050
have Alzheimer's disease this is a

89
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:30,819
gradual shrinking of the neurons in the

90
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,010
cerebrum this can cause memory loss

91
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,530
emotional disturbances in inability to

92
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:37,959
function its own and ultimately sadly

93
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,669
death by the body simply does not being

94
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,719
able to make those necessary connections

95
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:44,769
to produce vital bodily functions

96
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,840
epilepsy is another one this is an

97
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:50,050
abrupt transmission of a message between

98
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,370
the neurons and the brain sorry had

99
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,050
abnormal transmission of messages

100
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,289
between the neurons in the brain

101
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:59,170
this can be abrupt in the sense that a

102
00:03:56,289 --> 00:04:00,849
seizure could occur in part or the

103
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,879
entire part of the brain here we see a

104
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,069
partial seizure this is normal EEG

105
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,219
levels normal brain activity the partial

106
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,530
seizures that increase them out

107
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:12,729
generalized seizure grandmom's where the

108
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,819
whole brain kind of goes through this

109
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:17,709
mutated massive elevated signal levels

110
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:18,639
throughout the entire brain this would

111
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,920
be called epilepsy

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,959
well I'll see those at least that we're

113
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,569
going to discuss here our multiple

114
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,489
sclerosis or tay-sachs disease these

115
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:30,098
both result from a digit generation

116
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,019
of the myelin sheath located in neurons

117
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:34,180
now these myelin sheets offer of

118
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:36,159
protection notice that there's this

119
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,519
electricity transfers here not having

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,050
protected the single kind of dies out

121
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,870
here the signals being able to jump and

122
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,728
move a lot quicker this breakdown of the

123
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,240
myelin sheath is what's reducing the

124
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:51,240
signal I'm reducing that signal is

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,449
causing all sorts of potential symptoms

126
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,720
be everything from cognitive impairment

127
00:04:54,449 --> 00:05:01,389
to simple pain to not having our organs

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,270
function properly all this is because of

129
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,960
a loss of the neurons ability to

130
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,959
transfer signals
