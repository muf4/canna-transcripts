1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
okay here we're looking at the three

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,940
secondary nutrients anyway so I have the

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,799
shifter here of the cars our primary

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,240
nutrients are needed first and then

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,519
secondary nutrients are kind of the ones

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,730
we would go to next as far as concern

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,219
when feeding our plants so looking first

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,079
at calcium represent ICA it's involved

9
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,939
with providing structural support to

10
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,179
cell walls and serves as a secondary

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,910
messenger in response to stress it does

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,039
not translate well in the plant so

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,990
that's in mindful they keep that in mind

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,250
as a grower that's hard to kind of get

15
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,170
that through the plant you can show

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,420
deficiency symptoms particularly in the

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,550
newer growth so looking up neutralize

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,189
acids when it's added there can be

19
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,409
commonly found in bones and again that

20
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,218
cell wall keep in mind that's a very

21
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:49,229
important component of plant cells

22
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:51,120
magnesium is the second one I want to go

23
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,308
over and it's essential component of

24
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,099
chlorophyll and also aids in the

25
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,509
activation of many plant enzymes is we

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,070
see the comparison here of plant

27
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,750
chlorophyll with it the magnesium there

28
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,738
in the center we notice if we look for

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,340
the quick these structures are very

30
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:05,158
similar

31
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,320
this is hemoglobin in the human body so

32
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,030
hemoglobin spining oxygen and we can see

33
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,609
magnesium here being that central

34
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,650
molecule being important for chlorophyll

35
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,959
production all the lower leaves will

36
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,080
typically show a deficiency by yellowing

37
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,908
first dolomitic limestone kind of that

38
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,829
limestone we used to correct pH is a

39
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,780
common source for magnesium for the

40
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,179
plants keep an eye out if you're using

41
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,579
cocoa quar is this media of choice and

42
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,650
supplementation is often needed so if

43
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:33,359
you're using cocoa car if that's the

44
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,609
media you're choosing these keep in mind

45
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,009
you may have to be adding more magnesium

46
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:40,560
in a grower choosing another media

47
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,868
source lhasa here we have sulfur it's

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,519
need for amino acid our protein or

49
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:47,519
enzyme production keep in mind amino

50
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,798
acids make up proteins and proteins are

51
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,978
our general category for enzymes a

52
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,299
sulfur also helps chlorophyll formation

53
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,459
an improved root growth and seed

54
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,799
production sulfur may be applied to soil

55
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,289
from rainwater via acid rain however

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,479
this is becoming less and less over time

57
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,490
as we're cleaning up the acid rain which

58
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,890
is a great thing because it's you know

59
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:09,329
degrading some of our forests and you

60
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,969
know our roading some of our monuments

61
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,680
that's a great thing but as a result

62
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,049
that acid rain was supplying

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,819
sulfur so girls may now need to add some

64
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,129
sulfur products the supplement what's

65
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:22,018
not coming free from the rain water if

66
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:23,699
you use gypsum or epsom salts this will

67
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:25,980
increase sulfur levels so if you're

68
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,500
looking at a way to add at epsom salts

69
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,358
and or gypsum are ways to do that so you

70
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,209
can find that is the third of the

71
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:35,879
secondary nutrients is another one to

72
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,239
keep an eye out for in your play in your

73
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:38,239
plants
