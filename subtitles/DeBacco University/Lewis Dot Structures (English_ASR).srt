1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,009
okay we're gonna get into some basics of

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,259
Lewis dot structures now that name

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,380
exactly how it looks we see a bunch of

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,780
dots these dots are referring to or

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,880
representing the valence electrons of

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,618
individual atoms we're looking at

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,990
bonding between atoms when those we use

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:20,730
these lines to indicate that but let's

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,969
get this in a little more detail also

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,740
run through some examples so start with

11
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:28,140
Lewis dot structures these are often

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,959
used to show how bonding between atoms

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,630
occurs here are some basics to show

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,808
individual atoms and also some simple

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,670
atomic bonds we see that represented

16
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:42,328
here these bonds these lines indicate

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,250
his hands are bound together so for

18
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,558
developing a lewis dot structure our

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,019
step one is is to determine the total

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,369
number of valence electrons we want to

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,090
look at the periodic table to determine

22
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:56,250
this keeping in mind family one has one

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,160
valence electron family two is two

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,340
valence electrons family 13 has three

25
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:06,209
down four times 14 is four males so on

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,700
and so forth just be aware that family

27
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:13,319
eighteen the noble gases typically have

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,118
eight except for helium now lose that

29
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,219
step to one determine the total number

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,549
of electrons needed to fill each atoms

31
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,650
outer shell remember the octet rule

32
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:26,368
every atoms like they have eight valence

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,618
electrons as its shared or transferred

34
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:31,590
so here's oxygen represent by the red

35
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,540
you see one two three four five six

36
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,609
valence electrons what it typically has

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,200
but because it's covalently bonded with

38
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:39,420
carbon and kind of can share two more

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,520
therefore they count as part of oxygen

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,978
that will have eight same thing goes for

41
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,289
this oxygen because those electrons are

42
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,438
being shared carbon typically has four

43
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,450
its borrowing two electrons are sharing

44
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,429
two electrons from this oxygen atom be

45
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,379
sharing two from this oxygen atom so it

46
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,090
has also eight long that octet rule now

47
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,810
step three is to draw the elements on

48
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,700
your paper

49
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,090
typically the oven with the least number

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,290
of particles goes into the center and

51
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,509
there should be some that symmetry to

52
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,219
your layout so in this example we don't

53
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:12,929
have all these oxygens at the bottom are

54
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:14,759
all clustered over in one area

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,879
you're typically gonna be fairly evenly

56
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,188
spaced out is that's what the generally

57
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:22,548
the most stable structure is for

58
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:25,919
different molecules

59
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:29,938
step four two electrons shared between

60
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,768
two atoms form a bond and draw two

61
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:33,840
elements between atoms to form a

62
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,670
chemical bond so we see here

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,009
bonds are hydrogens bound to our

64
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:39,988
nitrogen and we see that evident here

65
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,908
with these lines representing two

66
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:45,060
electrons there's two what we call

67
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:46,979
unshared pairs of electrons and those

68
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,739
are located here and those are left as

69
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:54,179
two dots these electrons that are being

70
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,620
shared I represent by unlocking now put

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,780
in the steps together our step one is

72
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,379
well we have two fluorine atoms here

73
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,000
here's our two elements step two I'm

74
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:04,878
gonna bond them together you see these

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,019
two are forming bonds and the name

76
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:10,348
shared between these two and that will

77
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,969
then be transferred in to O line these

78
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:14,848
are individual atoms forming molecules

79
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:17,549
in this case so want to go through some

80
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:19,500
simple examples to go through and see if

81
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:23,219
you can develop a lewis dot structure

82
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,009
for these individual atoms and also the

83
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,019
molecule of carbon dioxide so take a

84
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:31,138
moment here pause the video hopefully

85
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:35,129
you will and try it for yourself before

86
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:37,109
I reveal the answers hopefully now

87
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:39,120
you've paused the video now she has to

88
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:41,900
try to send your own and hopefully you

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,090
come up with answers that look like this

90
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,039
remember calcium with F 2 oxygen there's

91
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,389
1 2 3 4 5 6

92
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,098
boron would have 3 potassium ok would

93
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:58,290
have one remember it's in Group one

94
00:03:53,098 --> 00:04:01,679
sulfur here 2 3 4 5 6 and then the X's

95
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:04,590
are representing the electrons with the

96
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,030
carbon and the red ones with oxygen we

97
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,549
see here as the example I showed

98
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,280
previously this is following the octet

99
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,889
rule for this very simple molecule of

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,629
carbon dioxide oh that helps explain a

101
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,629
little bit about Lewis dot structures
