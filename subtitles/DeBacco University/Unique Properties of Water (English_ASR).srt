1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
here we're gonna look at the unique

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,849
properties of water which is probably a

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,429
substance you take for granted what's

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:09,839
going on molecular level so let's get

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,809
into a little bit well about what's

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,129
going on here with water now we're

7
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:16,469
probably familiar with the solid liquid

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,940
and gaseous form of water and we're

9
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:19,799
pretty much at one atmosphere of

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,539
pressure so what this is showing here is

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,789
pressure and temperature and at one

12
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,189
atmosphere you know water freezes at 0

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,380
degrees Celsius and it's boiling point

14
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,329
is 100 degrees Celsius but we can see if

15
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,539
we change the pressure we will shift

16
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:34,649
that boiling point and where that occurs

17
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,140
snowflakes a unique crystalline

18
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,079
structures of water here familiar with

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,530
if you live in a climate that has cold

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,789
weather so what's kind of the basic

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,840
properties that's going on here

22
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,020
well what's important remember that

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,059
water is what we call a polar molecule

24
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,489
in a water molecule two hydrogen atoms

25
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:56,399
form a single polar covalent bonds with

26
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,169
oxygen atoms we see here this gives

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,170
water more structure than other liquids

28
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,359
because oxygens more electronegative the

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,280
region around this oxygen has a partial

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,780
negative charge because it's the

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,219
electronegativities pulling those

32
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,900
electrons closer to it

33
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:11,969
remember electrons have a negative

34
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,219
charge so here's our partial negative

35
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,890
charge the region near the two hydrogen

36
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,868
atoms has a partial positive charge and

37
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,159
we see that depicted here also that's

38
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:21,959
because there's electrons being pulled

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,430
away creating a negative charge here

40
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,069
we're creating a slightly positive

41
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,900
charge it's very important so this is

42
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,779
what allows water to perform we call

43
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,390
hydrogen bonds this holds the molecule

44
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,609
together and each water molecule can

45
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,750
form a maximum of four hydrogen bonds we

46
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:39,030
had to think in a three-dimensional

47
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,549
structure the hydrogen bonds joining our

48
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,920
molecules are a weak only about 120th is

49
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,240
strongest covalent bonds if they form

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
they break they reform with great

51
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,688
frequency we'll see here the hydrogen

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,118
bonds are represented by a dashed line

53
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:52,798
or the covalent bonds by a solid dark

54
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,899
line in the kinetic the covalent bonds

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,280
are stronger than the weaker hydrogen

56
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,670
bonds that are breaking and reforming

57
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,890
quite frequently cohesion is important

58
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,590
in plants so hydrogen bonds holds the

59
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,319
substance together phenomena called

60
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,969
cohesion cohesion among water molecules

61
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,430
plays a key role in the transport of

62
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,628
water it's graduating plants when we

63
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,629
talk about plants begin to capillary

64
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:15,519
actions

65
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:18,069
of the molecular structure that allows

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,719
that to happen in our dash lines here

67
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,370
representing hydrogen bonds we see a

68
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,750
partial positive biting to a partial

69
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,560
negative charge it's gonna break and

70
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,270
reform and a continual rate I can kind

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,780
of remember and compare cohesion and

72
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,480
adhesion

73
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,400
well adhesion is the cleaning of one

74
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,189
substance to another which contributes

75
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,640
to as water adheres to the walls of the

76
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:41,680
vesicles so adhesion what you think of

77
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,079
like an adhesive like a tape tape

78
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,500
sticking to the wall tape sticking to a

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,570
desk in this case its water binding to

80
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,219
something other than water water to a

81
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,829
leaf surface we see that here with the

82
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:55,919
needles tree water clinging to that leaf

83
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,180
service that's the property of adhesion

84
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,829
cohesion is water budding to walk to

85
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,439
water what's holding this droplet

86
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:06,280
together is cohesion so water molecules

87
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:08,199
binding to other water molecules here we

88
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,750
see that in action with our spiderweb

89
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,939
here the water is adhering to the web

90
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,620
material here it's adhering to the plant

91
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:17,020
material here it's adhering to the glass

92
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,700
the cohesive properties are the waters

93
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,650
again water molecules binding the water

94
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:24,219
molecules through hydrogen bonds causing

95
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:29,050
is a little little tiny water droplets

96
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:30,699
to form here here in here so surface

97
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,710
tension will causes that droplet to form

98
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,899
will surface tension and this is a

99
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,550
measure of the force necessary to

100
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,099
stretch or break the surface of a liquid

101
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,410
it's related to cohesion the cohesive

102
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,180
properties water has a greater surface

103
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,069
tension than most other liquids because

104
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,860
hydrogen bonds among surface water

105
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,629
molecules resists stretching or breaking

106
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,930
at the surface that's what allows this

107
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:56,259
water droplet to form and maintain a

108
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,270
very fearful shape we may think of

109
00:03:56,259 --> 00:04:00,609
surface tension as like water bugs

110
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,200
because some animals can stay in walk or

111
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,690
run on water without breaking the

112
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,280
surface tension the water Strider here

113
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:08,620
little water bugs that makes you run

114
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,719
across the surface or the desk ELISA

115
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,360
lizard where it kind of uses its large

116
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,039
webbed feet and the surface tension of

117
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,989
water to kind of skim and run right

118
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,298
across the water surface away from

119
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:22,629
predators watch this YouTube video to

120
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:24,189
see some of that now water is also

121
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:27,189
important at moderate temperature on

122
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:27,399
earth water stabilizes air temperature

123
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:29,168
by

124
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,929
absorbing heat from warmer air and

125
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:33,519
releasing heat to cooler air water can

126
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,199
absorb a release relatively large

127
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,508
amounts of heat with only a slight

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,770
change in its own temperature we see

129
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:42,490
that here we're going through August

130
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:43,569
September October November December you

131
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,090
see that Northern Hemisphere being

132
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,459
cooler what water is helping moderate

133
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:51,399
this these are monthly mean temperatures

134
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:54,310
and in Celsius and Fahrenheit converted

135
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:58,750
here and it's helping moderate that as a

136
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:02,620
very unique property of being able to

137
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,600
stabilize heat sources because can

138
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,759
absorb or release large amounts of heat

139
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,419
energy is only a slight change in the

140
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,788
actual water temperature so this

141
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:14,889
specific heat concept is the amount of

142
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:16,959
heat that must be absorbed or lost for a

143
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,900
one gram of the substance to change its

144
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,598
temperature by one degree Celsius about

145
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:25,029
71% of the earth is covered by water and

146
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:26,800
water serves as a large heat sink this

147
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:28,750
is responsible for the prevention of

148
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,910
temperature fluctuations you'll know

149
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,348
that if you go down near the coast in

150
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,300
the summer time it typically will be

151
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:36,490
cooler is that water is kind of

152
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,129
providing that heat sink the cooler

153
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,280
region coastal areas having this milder

154
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:44,408
climate to have less extremes in a very

155
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,478
stable marine environment it's a lot of

156
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:49,180
energy a lot of heat over an extended

157
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,009
period of time to change a large body of

158
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,209
water particularly the ocean or

159
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:56,228
estuaries so where is Earth's water well

160
00:05:55,209 --> 00:06:00,269
if you look at the first one here the

161
00:05:56,228 --> 00:06:04,418
total global water 96.5% is in the ocean

162
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:06,969
only 2.5 percent is fresh water there's

163
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:08,288
some other saline water of this two and

164
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,810
a half percent so this little blue

165
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:12,370
region here if we look at that closer we

166
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,348
expand that out this is just the fresh

167
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,689
water so within this two-and-a-half

168
00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:18,719
percent sixty eight point seven is

169
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:21,158
locked up in glaciers and ice caps

170
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,870
thirty percent a little or thirty

171
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:25,149
percent is in groundwater there's some

172
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,189
other surface and freshwater if we look

173
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:28,689
at this little one point two percent of

174
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:31,209
surface another freshwater and expand

175
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:34,418
that out most of that's ground ice or

176
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:36,129
permafrost about 69 percent lakes make

177
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:39,158
up another twenty point nine percent in

178
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,569
sea soil moisture swamps rivers or

179
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:41,288
living things in the atmosphere how that

180
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,050
breaks

181
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:45,399
so again look at this this here is a

182
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,770
zoom in of this two-and-a-half percent

183
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:49,418
in this area here the surface water in

184
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:52,990
other fresh waters is zooming this one

185
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:54,758
point two percent tuning on evaporative

186
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,500
cooling cooling of the surface occurs

187
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,639
when the liquid evaporates it's

188
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,269
responsible for monitoring Earth's

189
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,680
climate

190
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:02,109
stabilizing temperature in aquatic

191
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,090
ecosystems and preventing organisms from

192
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,460
overeating might be familiar that in the

193
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:08,288
hot summer happy these cooling centers

194
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,299
this high missed area when that

195
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:13,750
evaporates it's taking away the heat and

196
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,848
giving you that cooling effect density

197
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,550
the water dense water is actually most

198
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:20,168
dense at four degrees Celsius even

199
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,598
though it freezes at zero degree Celsius

200
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:24,848
it's most Incept four degrees it

201
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,250
contracts until at four degrees and it

202
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:29,620
will actually expand or get larger from

203
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,000
four degrees to zero degrees we see

204
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,209
here's our temperature at zero degrees

205
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,240
here's our density maximum density at

206
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:38,948
four degrees it's changing the reason

207
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,038
why to go over a bridge you might see

208
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:44,770
this because the road surface is going

209
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:46,060
to expand and contract for example just

210
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,769
like water is going to expand and

211
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,870
contract at different temperatures so

212
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:52,689
they put this to allow that surface to

213
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:56,550
to expand and contract without cooling

214
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:59,259
the asphalt here or damaging the bridge

215
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,819
density of water and prevents water from

216
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,710
freezing from the bottom up it's very

217
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,959
important that frozen water is less

218
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:06,989
dense to allowed to flow because this

219
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,908
allows ice to form at the surface first

220
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,710
the freezing of water releases heat to

221
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:13,839
the water below creating an insulating

222
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:15,848
factor this makes transition between

223
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,179
seasons less abrupt when we have this

224
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:21,189
area here frozen over it allows us to

225
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,319
kind of have a more normal kind of

226
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:24,848
transition from the winter months to the

227
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,538
summer ones with a spring that will

228
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:30,038
slowly

229
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:31,779
ideally warm up over time the structure

230
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,908
of ice when water reaches zero degree

231
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,799
Celsius water becomes locked into a

232
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:38,309
crystal lattice with each molecule

233
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,348
bonded to the maximum of four partners

234
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,449
ice is actually about ten percent less

235
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,160
dense in water at four degrees in this

236
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,570
crystalline structure that's 4minute we

237
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:50,769
see here we sees a lot of air pockets

238
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:53,528
this is why ice is less dense than four

239
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,370
degree Celsius water and this is why ice

240
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:56,889
floats

241
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:01,919
is less dense than 4 degrees Celsius

242
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:05,019
water so water is this solvent for life

243
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,169
remember a solution is composed of

244
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:12,039
solute in a solvent so here the Salyut

245
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:15,309
this could be table sugar or this could

246
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:17,579
be salt is this is the solute and this

247
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:20,049
is the minor component in a solution

248
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,720
here the solvent is a substance that

249
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:24,370
dissolves the solute typically a liquid

250
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,620
that can be a solid or a gas in this

251
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,769
case it is a liquid this creates here

252
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,690
once this dissolves an aqueous solution

253
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,789
an aqueous solution is saying that the

254
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,370
solvent is water aqueous room referring

255
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:38,079
to water so instead of just a solution

256
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,230
there's be an aqueous solution that are

257
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,278
looking at the solvent the substance

258
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:47,230
that dissolves a solute being water

259
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:50,320
lastly comparing a hydrophilic with

260
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,509
hydrophobic hydrophilic likes water

261
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,028
these are ionic compounds that dissolves

262
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:58,778
in water polar molecules for the most

263
00:09:55,028 --> 00:10:01,299
part are water soluble hydrophobic this

264
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:03,909
kind of scared of dislikes water these

265
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:05,979
are nonpolar compounds so here's our

266
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:08,708
hydrophobic dislikes water we see that

267
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,289
this is trying to repel creating this

268
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:13,329
kind of large bubble of that if these

269
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:15,458
substance here is hydrophilic meaning it

270
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:18,310
likes water let's see it kind of spread

271
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:20,289
out and from this sheet here so the

272
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:22,778
cuticle of plants is typically made of

273
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:24,699
wax very hydrophobic that's why you see

274
00:10:22,778 --> 00:10:27,189
the beating of these water droplets

275
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,050
occurring hopefully this gives you some

276
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,320
appreciation for the unique properties

277
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:31,319
of water
