1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,000
welcome to tobacco university here we're

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,639
going to be investigating

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,638
animal hair comparisons and while we can

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,960
see some obvious differences here

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,000
at the macroscopic level we're going to

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,639
be looking more at the

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,519
microscopic comparisons of different

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,198
animal hairs

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,199
from different animals as well as with

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,199
on the same animal

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,400
so first off animal hairs in general uh

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,480
do not pines

13
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,159
possess enough individual microscopic

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,399
characteristics to exclude

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,320
other similar animals and can be

16
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,919
associated with a unique

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,480
individual so we're just kind of looking

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,880
at just generally classifying them

19
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,199
if the question here exhibits the same

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,840
microscopic characteristics as a known

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,440
hairs

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
it's concluded that the hair is

23
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,439
consistent originating

24
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,878
from that particular animal and we could

25
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,439
see here we're maybe comparing different

26
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,079
pelts

27
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,759
of different animal hairs so when we're

28
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,239
looking at the images and i'm going to

29
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,878
include

30
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,238
hopefully quite a few of them so you can

31
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,079
be able to kind of get that nice little

32
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,759
comparison between them we want to be

33
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,119
thinking about the diameter

34
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,119
of the medulla the scales and the

35
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,359
general patterns of those hairs

36
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,719
so again what's the what's the diameter

37
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,640
uh what's the medulla what's the

38
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,478
repeating kind of shape the perimeter

39
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,079
what's the width and the length again

40
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,400
measured in microns here

41
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,000
if provided a scale and here we're

42
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
seeing just kind of that example of how

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,478
we might want to break down

44
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,159
one of these microscopic images going

45
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,239
forward

46
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,840
so just a general comparison you know

47
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,839
just looking at kind of the obvious

48
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,118
classification we can see some

49
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,880
very stark differences here looking at

50
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,400
scale casts looking at that kind of

51
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,798
cuticle region

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,320
of how some are kind of like all

53
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,880
interlocked with one another

54
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,039
how have these definite kind of like uh

55
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,359
scales of a fish interlocked

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,880
together uh the river otter here having

57
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,599
a little bit more of that irregular

58
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,239
pattern

59
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,359
um so again just having no background

60
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,640
just kind of looking at these four

61
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,840
images we can clearly

62
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,680
see some differences continuing on

63
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,320
to looking at comparing fibers within

64
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,280
one family these are all classified

65
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,639
under the rodent family and still we can

66
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,840
see that there are some

67
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,679
differences here as well again maybe not

68
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,319
as historically different as the last

69
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,439
image

70
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,958
but definitely when matching an unknown

71
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,639
sample up to some knowns

72
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,640
we could definitely see where we could

73
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,318
at least eliminate some potential

74
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,119
options

75
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,598
so just taking one example here looking

76
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,800
at the

77
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,919
links uh for example here when we're

78
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,719
looking at kind of

79
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,559
the diameter and the medulla as i said

80
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,159
here we have the little bar here

81
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,759
uh representing 20 micro meters here

82
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,079
here we're seeing um this would be the

83
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,719
diameter of 40 microns and a medulla of

84
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,480
35. keep in mind that the guard cell

85
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,039
from lynx number one is what's shown

86
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,959
here

87
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,560
on the cells medulla are long flattened

88
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,239
shape that span the width of the medulla

89
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,920
some of the cells are slightly cupped

90
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,840
with many bubble-like features

91
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,839
between the cells this is continuous

92
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
repeating s-shaped running between the

93
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,479
cells throughout the medulla

94
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,479
now the images down here all the images

95
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,799
on the slide are all from the links

96
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,679
keep in mind we have the guard scale

97
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
cast here

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,840
so we're taking a casting of the actual

99
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,560
kind of cuticle region

100
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
we have the guard here pictured here we

101
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,199
have the

102
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,000
under fur and then we have a different

103
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,560
area here

104
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,199
of the under furnace and we can see that

105
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,680
there are

106
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,238
some differences so keep in mind that

107
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,159
we're here

108
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,280
we're looking at a general comparison

109
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,120
between the two

110
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,039
um so it's important to keep that in

111
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,280
mind when we're trying to make some sort

112
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,919
of

113
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,519
matches or classifications of hair that

114
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,639
might be found

115
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,759
continuing on here for the red fox and

116
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,479
we kind of see that similar image look

117
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,039
at the diameter look at the medulla here

118
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,119
a crossroad fox guard here in polarized

119
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,239
light so how we look at it can also

120
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,000
impact the image that we may see here

121
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,080
we're seeing the cells who do appear as

122
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,680
wide flat and shaped with no

123
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,599
regular boundaries in some places the

124
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,480
cells appearing angular

125
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,598
and this is the guard cell at 400 times

126
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,798
magnification

127
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,119
and here's the guard scale with the

128
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,480
scale cast so again that's we're kind of

129
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,480
taking that cuticle

130
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,079
region and getting a cast kind of an

131
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,079
impression if you will

132
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,840
of that cuticle region this is the

133
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,840
midsection of the guard here

134
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,039
keep in mind where you're taking that

135
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,639
the lower section the mid

136
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,079
or the outer i'm going to be kind of

137
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,160
more towards the tip region

138
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,000
that can impact potentially what you're

139
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
going to see in an image so important to

140
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,800
document that when you're taking

141
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,799
pictures

142
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,160
then we have the here we have the short

143
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,240
tailed weasel

144
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
and we're seeing the guard um here where

145
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,120
the medulla shows a transition where

146
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,600
fibers

147
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
widen there's a deep wavy s-curve here

148
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,919
to the medulla

149
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,918
the location where the medulla

150
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,560
transition has a wider section

151
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,439
of hair we do see that differentiation

152
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,759
occurring here

153
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,600
in this guard cell keep in mind this is

154
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,360
at 200 magnification this is the

155
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,759
short-tailed weasel the under fur

156
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,360
region where we're also noticing some

157
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,160
very different medulla

158
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,160
present here so again just that source

159
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,639
of comparison

160
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,320
looking at a woodchuck so here's one

161
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,600
kind of nibbling on some plant material

162
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,439
there

163
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,520
looking at the under fur we're seeing a

164
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,000
compilation of kind of

165
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,959
hairs here and we do see kind of quite

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,519
the difference

167
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,359
here we have unicereal lateral medulla

168
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,359
we have a more complicated medulla and

169
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,240
here we actually have no medulla due to

170
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,840
the intense

171
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,759
pigmentation now present so again

172
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,038
keeping in mind where you're sampling

173
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,120
that hair

174
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,079
or where that hair is being identified

175
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,840
might require you

176
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,240
to look at different regions of the

177
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,079
individual but will help you potentially

178
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,400
identify where that hair sample may have

179
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,199
come from look at the scales near the

180
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,000
base here

181
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,720
look at the wide shape between the scale

182
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,439
margins

183
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,280
this fairly smooth scale margins here

184
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,560
all of these with a trained eye can

185
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,079
allow you to kind of

186
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,600
get into some more of the details of

187
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,079
comparison we also have

188
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,280
typically the diameter of the hair to

189
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,399
the medulla can help us

190
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,719
define that medullary index

191
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,399
likewise we also have the beaver here so

192
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,919
again a brown here that's great

193
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,679
but we can see some differences between

194
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,279
the beaver and the woodchuck so while

195
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,759
initially they look like brown hair

196
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,638
and even very similar organisms on a

197
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
quick look

198
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,319
looking at the hairs we do see some

199
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
differences and it's important to be

200
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,680
looking at those details

201
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,119
so you're able to kind of classify what

202
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,038
was that here from a beaver

203
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,199
or hear from a woodchuck in the example

204
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,839
provided here

205
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,319
then we have the arctic ground squirrel

206
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,239
and

207
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,000
again that kind of diameter to medulla

208
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,519
is a very common

209
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,600
characteristic here that we're used for

210
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,038
comparison also looking at the scale

211
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,160
cast again for that source of comparison

212
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,399
and classification now keep in mind

213
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,520
this is only a small sample but if this

214
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,599
is something that interest you want to

215
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,719
look at it into some more detail

216
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,039
the alaska fur id project at alaska

217
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,560
for id.wordpress.com is where a lot of

218
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,759
these information was

219
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,319
gathered is a great resource has a lot

220
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,479
of

221
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,000
different animal cares for comparison

222
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,318
and of interest of you

223
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,598
i highly recommend you go about checking

224
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,598
this resource out
