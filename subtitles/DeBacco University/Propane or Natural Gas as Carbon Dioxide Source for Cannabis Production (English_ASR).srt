1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,080
looking to enrich your growing area with

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,080
carbon dioxide

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,359
and using propane or natural gas is the

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,199
source for that

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,718
here at tobacco university we're going

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:17,920
to describe this

7
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:17,919
exact situation

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,079
all right let's get into the video using

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,640
propane or natural gas as carbon dioxide

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,358
source

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,240
for cannabis production so first off

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,039
just a general word of caution

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,119
some of these units can be a potential

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,519
fire hazard so caution when

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,199
you're using these units maybe need

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,719
adjustment to reduce the chance of

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
contaminants being released into the

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,879
grow space

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,000
example ethylene and carbon monoxide can

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,238
be added through

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,679
incomplete combustion so when using

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,119
propane for example

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,878
does come with these warnings should be

24
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,759
this should be on the propane tank that

25
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,839
you're using

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,198
if there was complete combustion propane

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,039
combined with oxygen

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,878
will simply produce carbon dioxide and

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,920
water we want the carbon dioxide to help

30
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,839
the plants grow

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,159
but water will help will increase the

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,320
humidity so just be aware of that

33
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,680
however if there's incomplete combustion

34
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,759
we still have propane

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,360
with combining with oxygen it will still

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,439
produce carbon dioxide in water

37
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,519
but there also will be free carbons as

38
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:17,839
well as carbon monoxide two things that

39
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,118
we

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,880
don't want to have in the grow space

41
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,239
because we're not getting that pure

42
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,399
or high percentage transfer

43
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,920
now specialized natural gas burners this

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
is what they would look like

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,159
these are categories as an unvented

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
heater and they have that nice kind of

47
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,200
blue glow to the flame in the cage it's

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,118
burning very hot

49
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,560
adding heat to the growing environment

50
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,879
which can be advantageous

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,399
in colder months but be aware that

52
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,118
plants can only utilize the carbon

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,599
dioxide

54
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,560
during the lights-on cycle of the

55
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,359
photosynthetic

56
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,478
process now direct-fired heaters is

57
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,118
another

58
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,159
example here the intake outside

59
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,239
combustion air

60
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,920
they have improved efficiency and safety

61
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,519
these units will produce carbon dioxide

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,040
and heat at the same time

63
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,959
and they've been utilized in a lot of

64
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,960
greenhouse and growing situations

65
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,399
so this is another consideration if

66
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,399
you're looking at increasing carbon

67
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,120
dioxide to your growing facility

68
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,080
and helping to increase plant production

69
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,080
overall
