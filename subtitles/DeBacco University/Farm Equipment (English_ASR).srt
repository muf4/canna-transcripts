1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,040
yeah I'm gonna go over some farm

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,169
equipment off general farm toys not

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,690
always are they things that are powered

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:12,089
and big tractors they can a simple

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,369
wheelbarrow or a shovel if you want to

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:17,640
know who your true friends are show my

7
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:19,698
shovel so going over just general

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,740
equipment what we may need on the farm

9
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:26,189
so the first step is appreciate what you

10
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:28,079
have to me easier said than done but the

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,990
basics of what you need in part depends

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,949
on what you already have so whether it's

13
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,449
a small rider mower a small tractor or a

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,620
larger tractor even just a walk-behind

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,180
tiller appreciate what you have because

16
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,339
what you're going to need what you think

17
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,590
you might need it's gonna depend on what

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,200
quipment you already had what your setup

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,920
is and how large or small your operation

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,920
may be so needs and wants what do you do

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,260
need it or do you want it we all look

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,320
good indeed the shows that nice shiny

23
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:04,219
new tractor but that could be is that

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,469
more of a need or is that really want

25
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:09,450
here's the old symbol there for Apple we

26
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,400
all want maybe a new computer but we all

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,728
need the actual food in substance

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,100
ideally being copy is right between the

29
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:19,679
needs and the wants and it could be very

30
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,199
hard to decipher in some cases but

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,979
sometimes take a step back and really

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,020
look at the situation so items worth

33
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,828
consideration so of the farms I visited

34
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:35,359
invent ooh and even my own little

35
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:37,379
operation here what's worth constancy

36
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,719
consideration what should you really

37
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,849
look at potentially getting and these

38
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,489
three things kind of keep coming up in

39
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,438
second inning a Miss blower and drip

40
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:49,259
irrigation with an injector and it's

41
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,539
kind of shows that netting on Miss

42
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,978
blower and drip irrigation with an

43
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,350
injector doesn't show the injector here

44
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,640
well why are these things important so a

45
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,989
sort the insect netting well ince

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,489
igniting is gonna be the way for the

47
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,589
future from what it seems like

48
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,349
instead pressures constantly increasing

49
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,930
it's the only item for insects that has

50
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:10,500
a hundred percent efficiency again

51
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,990
assuming it's installed properly we want

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,599
to make sure that we're protecting our

53
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,210
crap and especially with those trying to

54
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,539
be organic and not lying to or having

55
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,370
very limited applications of products

56
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:24,419
that they can apply a physical barrier

57
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,770
is the way to go

58
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:31,079
even for some chemical guys the spring

59
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,689
of its exercise does work on occasion

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,060
but nothing beats insect netting for

61
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,199
that true physical barrier now again

62
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,210
there are some things that come with it

63
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,399
there's set up there's the making sure

64
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,250
it's installed properly but it does

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,050
offer 100% effectiveness if it is

66
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,300
properly installed so there's different

67
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,310
mesh sizes so all insect anything is not

68
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,740
the same ought to include certain

69
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,719
insects again the larger the insect the

70
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,790
bigger the mesh size you can get away

71
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,379
with finer mesh should be advised to

72
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:01,169
protect against aphids or other small

73
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,750
insects here's some infant even down the

74
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:05,759
like little strips some cases larger

75
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,189
mesh is typically less expensive not

76
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,709
always but typically less expensive it

77
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,300
can be used for like squash bugs on

78
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,300
cucurbits that transmit yellow vine

79
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,000
decline become a major issue in our area

80
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,670
collard potato bill beetle get bigger

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,610
insects bigger mesh typically less cause

82
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:25,409
if it's very small tip require smaller

83
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,830
mesh sides and typically more expensive

84
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:31,169
in Sec netting so infinity more than

85
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,719
there's a crop cover highly recommend to

86
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:36,659
be installed on all season extenders

87
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:39,030
such as high tunnels do not make a hinge

88
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:41,159
door as it may left open so your high

89
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,319
tunnel structures if you have roll-up

90
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,789
sides they're great for air flow which

91
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,560
you may want to be in lining that with

92
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:49,349
insect netting to prevent insects from

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,810
getting established there early in the

94
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:54,389
season with you should but then starting

95
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,219
in that April or even March timeframe

96
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,559
you want to prevent your insects from

97
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,569
getting built up there the reason why I

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,340
say don't put a hinge door is if you

99
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,479
walk in you might close it but if

100
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,189
someone else walks in they may leave it

101
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,689
open leaving it open can allow some

102
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:09,030
insects to escape in and they've trapped

103
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,949
in a nice perfect environment I'm having

104
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,930
doors may have like

105
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,789
screens have like magnets that keep

106
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,350
coming through and they be attached that

107
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,139
can also be great and you walk through

108
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,400
and you snap them right back together

109
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,599
something to just have a pipe down so

110
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,459
you have picked the pipe up to walk in

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,320
and drop it right down immediately so

112
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:26,370
you're kind of eliminating the chance of

113
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,849
insects kind of sneak

114
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,949
in but still allowed you access physical

115
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,480
bear this isn't a new idea it seems like

116
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,639
everyone's like oh sick nanny

117
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,500
it's been used bird netting from grapes

118
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,939
to keep birds out of grape vineyards

119
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,668
same concept getting different mesh size

120
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,939
of course but same basic concept that

121
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:50,569
physical barrier providing that

122
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:53,339
separation between the crop and the test

123
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,719
the miss blow is another one this blower

124
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:56,728
can allow for efficient nutrient

125
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,500
applications Bruce is very small

126
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:00,990
droplets a fine mist

127
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,478
it's basically a backpack leaf blower

128
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,668
with a water tank the goal is to get the

129
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:08,370
droplets very small a very high surface

130
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:11,879
area which can allow them to be spread

131
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,250
out more efficiently on the crop this

132
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,750
blur saves time quick coverage to

133
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,668
provide better coverage over traditional

134
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,470
hand pump sprayers and it can get the

135
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:21,810
top in the bottom of the leaves very

136
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,430
quickly also means you don't feed right

137
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,918
there at the crop it can spread pretty

138
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,400
far distance and still be able to get

139
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,079
efficient coverage this blower allows

140
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,179
you to less product it's a cost savings

141
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:36,329
mine's actually paid for itself they are

142
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,639
expensive but the thei product that I've

143
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:41,430
used a lot less of I've been able to see

144
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,590
it cost that way not to mention the time

145
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,329
and labor stay tensed I've had so by

146
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:46,918
simply pulling the truck mix the area

147
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:49,079
going through and spraying I'm using

148
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,299
less product doing it in less time and

149
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:55,050
to me now it's completely paid for

150
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,129
itself still works just fine miss

151
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,470
blowers can help avoid the cult the

152
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:01,079
lobster arm here are fiddler crab here

153
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:04,770
where you're constantly one hands always

154
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:06,509
all season pumping the pump sprayer the

155
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:08,430
miss blower is gas-powered makes it

156
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:12,079
really easy and efficient to go through

157
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:15,209
and start it up and walk down the field

158
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:17,279
these are two examples steel makes two

159
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,750
models here I'll the downfall those they

160
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,418
can be heavy but there's two different

161
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,629
size options so the four gallon is here

162
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,250
it weighs 28 pounds empty and water

163
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,288
again about 8 pounds of gallon you can

164
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,300
do the math there adds up really quickly

165
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:32,699
but they have a small 2 gallon one it's

166
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,218
only 17 pounds again empty but you only

167
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,408
fit two gallons in it so it's it's less

168
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:39,389
weight in that regards this is basically

169
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:40,430
steels we lack or motor and says they're

170
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:42,919
true least

171
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,930
I've used them both I can say that they

172
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,199
both perform and they both do the same

173
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:50,480
function with the four gallon one is a

174
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,250
much bigger motor you basically run into

175
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,930
a net idle this one you have to use the

176
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,759
throttle a little bit but it's more than

177
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,259
capable so if you're someone it's a

178
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,000
little bit something lighter on their

179
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:02,449
back this would be a great option to

180
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,069
look at the other thing I should I think

181
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,250
most farmers should seriously consider

182
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:09,560
is drip irrigation in an injector so

183
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,839
drip tapes allow efficient watering low

184
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,110
of operation percentage in the injector

185
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,209
indicated here last for precise nutrient

186
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,980
application which allows you to put

187
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:21,079
stuff in the pail here and it's injected

188
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,060
right through to the crop they do

189
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:24,919
require some filters may be some

190
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,889
pressure gauges some extra plumbing but

191
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,420
it's well worth it in season do please

192
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,789
come in different thicknesses

193
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,319
if you sterilized your rows the thicker

194
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,660
can be more cost-effective because you

195
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,490
can use it multiple years there's the

196
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,850
six mil it's basically in one season use

197
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,620
used under plastic 8 mil common leaves

198
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,000
for vegetable crops again about one

199
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,250
season use but a little rougher and

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,889
tougher 10 mil come using heavy rock

201
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,319
areas or when turning something like a

202
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:53,539
strawberry plant and the 15 mil allows

203
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,420
multiple years of use I will say I've

204
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,490
used the 15 I'm using some on my sixth

205
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,750
year and it's working out just fine you

206
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,269
give to take care of it and pulled out

207
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,370
of the fields for the winter is a little

208
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:05,689
bit of a labour in that sense but using

209
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,300
it year after year makes it so much

210
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:11,779
easier then have enough you make all the

211
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,970
irrigation lines drip tapes their flow

212
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,559
lights and emitter spacings are

213
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,570
different this can determine the amount

214
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,310
of feet of tape you could run at once it

215
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:21,110
takes a little math calculations I'm not

216
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,149
going to worth a ton of math but

217
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,590
basically you can adjust the tapes or

218
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,929
flow rate to match the gallons per

219
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,279
minute your equipment good supply we've

220
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,000
got a lot of water you can double a lot

221
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:35,360
of water from irrigate large field or

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,309
you might have a slower kind of flow and

223
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,509
you just have to irrigate less at one

224
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,269
time just takes a little math

225
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:42,229
calculations give you some examples here

226
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:46,159
I'm not going to bore with all the

227
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,750
details but the key part is here if

228
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,120
you're assuming we have a consistent

229
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,460
seven gallons per minute which is on the

230
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,970
low end the amount of water you want to

231
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,460
add

232
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,700
it's 400 gallons your total world feet

233
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:01,639
is 1500 feet well in this case if you

234
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,140
got the low flow you can run 3000 feet

235
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,120
of drip tape at once if you get to

236
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:07,549
higher flow you can only run 1500 drip

237
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,590
tapes at once this one you'd have to run

238
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:11,629
twice as long two hours because it flows

239
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,149
less this and you can run for less time

240
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:16,250
so again depends on the pump in the area

241
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:17,000
a lot of companies are very willing to

242
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,470
help you out

243
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,600
and while the math may look scary

244
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,950
initially once it kind of dive into the

245
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,480
numbers you can always pause the video

246
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,750
and look at it in more detail it's

247
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,690
really not that bad the injector says

248
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,100
dosatrons is for him name it allows for

249
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,230
precise amount of liquid to be

250
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,450
fertilized the irrigation at a time

251
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,800
these are ones might here off they're

252
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,690
running and they kind of click click

253
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,579
click click click click click click

254
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,520
sound as they're going through the

255
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,410
injecting the fertilizer as the water

256
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,939
flows by you can see here valves here

257
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:49,159
this one's not running or operational

258
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,810
the valves are closed off so you don't

259
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,389
always have to run it through here but

260
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,799
it gives you that option injectors they

261
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:56,360
can be used when needed they can move to

262
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,729
different zones they make little carts

263
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,379
and it can provide a quick fix if you're

264
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,930
in a situation where you knows

265
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:05,659
crops going a little deficient in

266
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:07,279
something you could we load these over

267
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:08,779
here hook it up to the irrigation line

268
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,769
and go through and fertilize the crop

269
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:14,480
just what it needs a Mazzy injector is

270
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,210
less expensive alternative to the

271
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,480
dosatron type injectors there's no one

272
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,220
in carts they work with the entry effect

273
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:26,210
if you're familiar with carburetors if

274
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,759
you're have an old tractor or an older

275
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,470
car they have their issues but their

276
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,899
jury is basically what's going out the

277
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,340
carburetor in the case of mashing

278
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,569
injector here you can see it's set up

279
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,519
very similar to the other one there's a

280
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,930
timer and a fertile and a filter I

281
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,789
should say in the fertilizer injector

282
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,620
these do tend to lose some pressure

283
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:44,329
because they're working on the venturi

284
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,519
effect which is passing liquid through a

285
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,250
smaller area causing it to move faster

286
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:52,939
changing pressures allowed to soak up

287
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,129
the fertilizer here and you do lose some

288
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,490
pressure overall so just again it's a

289
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:00,350
big leap in mind for your system however

290
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,909
just because you can inject fertilizer

291
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,250
doesn't mean you should always be doing

292
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:06,829
it focus on a few key elements to liquid

293
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,070
feed your soil should do the mean

294
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,930
feeding okay this is a fertilizers dream

295
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,879
the grower the farmer who buys the

296
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,919
entire car every different type of

297
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,450
nutrient because they got this fancy new

298
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,909
injector and they're spending all this

299
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:22,850
money injecting fertilizers because they

300
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:24,259
can focus on a few your soil should

301
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,060
really be prepped and you shouldn't be

302
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,220
going through and having to fertilize

303
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:32,659
with a ton of stuff nitrogen is a key

304
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,370
one sometimes potassium too so wish

305
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,079
lists for farm equipment different for

306
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,840
each individual unique farm you know

307
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,110
everyone has different wish lists some

308
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:46,040
some can give smaller items larger items

309
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:48,110
but everyone I know has a wish list the

310
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,049
tried and true all does that say

311
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,370
outdated anti tractor still around for a

312
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:55,609
reason or overbuilt

313
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:59,330
they're very heavy this is a new to me

314
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:01,430
john deere em that I bought 1949 you

315
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,379
spot it is kind of fixed it up a little

316
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,839
bit ran through runs just fine two

317
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:09,019
cylinders Johnny popper it does the job

318
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,690
just fine no issues so just because it's

319
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:13,639
old doesn't mean it's outdated so don't

320
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,330
always think he need the brand-new

321
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:19,100
latest and greatest computer technology

322
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:23,060
this is just a very very simple system

323
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,740
it works just fine there's also some

324
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,969
tools out there that one does it all

325
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,700
kind of the Swiss Army knife approach

326
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,800
the BCS Detroit built flex is kind of a

327
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,400
new one on the market here they lacked

328
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,199
specialization they can do it all if an

329
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,809
engine goes down though everything will

330
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,430
stop and you can only do one task at a

331
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,259
time so just because you know one power

332
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:43,729
base can go through and be a blower be a

333
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:45,319
snow blower be a mower be an air

334
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,519
compressor Clin to one of those at a

335
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,190
time so just important to keep that in

336
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,230
mind if this does fail you think all

337
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,970
your attachments simply don't work so

338
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,550
again just another reason for concern

339
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,290
but the advantages they have one thing

340
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:59,959
to keep and maintain so that does make

341
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:01,639
it a lot easier that typically you're

342
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,710
not mowing the lawn and snow blowing at

343
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,509
the same time so you're only using those

344
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,830
one at a time you take care of that

345
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:10,340
piece of equipment and it can last you a

346
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:12,290
long time specialized equipment can

347
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,320
allow for quick transitions be efficient

348
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:17,539
use a plastic mulch layer potato digger

349
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,620
cultivator specialized equipment you

350
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:20,419
know when you get into certain things

351
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,740
you may if you're spending all

352
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:24,409
that time doing that you may want to

353
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,149
congestive I in that case going through

354
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:28,189
and researching and buying that once

355
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:30,320
piece of specialized equipment that you

356
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,970
may only use one or two times a year but

357
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,510
if it makes it better overall for you

358
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,490
then it's worthwhile hey equipments a

359
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:41,179
prime example yeah all these different

360
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,259
lower attending the rake baler all these

361
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:44,208
different specialized pieces of

362
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:46,009
equipment are all needed to produce

363
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:48,909
those nice little square or those large

364
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:51,230
round bales needed for animal feed I

365
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:53,299
also want to make comparisons don't get

366
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,800
locked into one thing a lot of farmers

367
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,990
think oh it's a farm I need a tractor

368
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,389
well in some pieces a skid steer might

369
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,980
be better here's some just weighing some

370
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,560
of the pros and cons look at both sides

371
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,170
you can see here proce detractors good

372
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:09,409
for row crops long and high designed

373
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:11,059
designed mainly for farming not easily

374
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:14,509
maneuverable in tight spaces though

375
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:17,149
limiting on their lifting power that's

376
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:19,370
something of concern skid steer very

377
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,110
maneuverable high lift height good

378
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,850
weight capacity multiple attachment

379
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,860
options but they're very low ground

380
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,579
clearance and only front end attachments

381
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,300
no kind of three point hitch on the back

382
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:31,789
or something

383
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:33,528
so again pros and cons everything way

384
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:36,230
both sides talked with others see what

385
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:38,078
they're using preventive maintenance is

386
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:42,310
another important aspect there's a whole

387
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:46,370
different kind of lecture and

388
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:49,009
presentation on maintenance but this is

389
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,320
often I find overlooked I know it gets

390
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,750
busy in season checking the oil is

391
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,910
important checking tires for weathering

392
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,299
and grease fittings you can't stress

393
00:14:55,909 --> 00:15:00,289
that one enough knowing where they are

394
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:02,120
knowing what grease it's filled with

395
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:04,099
having a grease gun knowing where that's

396
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,649
located does that preventive maintenance

397
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,959
quick kind of coolant check tire

398
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:11,690
pressure check can really save you a lot

399
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,698
of time being down in season when you

400
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,339
really need a piece of equipment so just

401
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:18,379
good to check oil make sure it's in the

402
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,209
low to full ranges at burning oil is at

403
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:21,350
cleaner oil you don't have a tire go

404
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,479
down and grease fittings you want to

405
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,250
burn it out fittings quick little

406
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,730
maintenance can really save you a lot of

407
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,139
time and lastly for equipment I don't

408
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,089
want to be about hand tools I want to

409
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,870
think that every farm needs to have a

410
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:34,279
giant tractor

411
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,870
do not underestimate

412
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:40,539
made the need for simple hand tools and

413
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:43,459
the variety of hand tools a sigh I can't

414
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:45,139
I'm amazed at how many people don't have

415
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:48,169
one or no even what one is or if never

416
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,959
even used one we had a weed whacker go

417
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:52,878
down at one of the jobs I had previously

418
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:55,669
they had a size sitting on the barn door

419
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,459
forever and how no one's ever touched it

420
00:15:55,669 --> 00:16:00,139
and I grabbed it and cleaned up the area

421
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,698
we need to it takes a little getting

422
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,409
used to I'd be careful with them it's a

423
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:06,318
long blade but they can be very

424
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:08,179
efficient you're loppers you're pruning

425
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:09,889
shears your different types of shovels

426
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:11,659
everyone's got their favorite shell

427
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:13,759
whole different lengths so don't

428
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:15,799
underestimate the need and the

429
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,470
efficiency that hand tools can offer in

430
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:20,539
certain instances always have plenty on

431
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,829
board keep them hanged up so you don't

432
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:23,568
lose them or forget them in a field you

433
00:16:21,828 --> 00:16:24,859
don't want to leave one in the field and

434
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:27,259
run it over with something and pop a

435
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,688
tire or have other issues but hand tools

436
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:31,818
for especially smaller operations have a

437
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:36,099
wide variety keep them organized and

438
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:36,099
they can make your job a lot easier
