1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
while there's sadly many insects that

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,740
can infect and be of pests to tomatoes

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,259
and try to touch on for the major

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,019
highlights here for worms white flies

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,428
aphids and cut worms so starting with

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,809
horn worms what to look for well you

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,240
want to see small to large green

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:19,739
caterpillars eating tomato leaves now

9
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,269
some people have an eye for them and

10
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:22,919
they can spot them other people will

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,439
struggle to see them as you can see

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,570
despite their large size they can blend

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,490
in quite well if you want to cheat and

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,589
find them you can inspect your plants at

15
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:34,109
night with a black light as horns won't

16
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,460
glow however if you find a horned room

17
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,200
that has these white Little Pill like

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,239
structures attached to it you want to

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,850
leave those be because that's been

20
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,099
infected by a natural parasite and that

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,200
parasite will then produce offspring

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,230
that will be able to go through and hunt

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,120
down and destroy other horn worms and I

24
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:54,238
was fortunate to see one actually in the

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,128
app here's a wasp infecting this horn

26
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,019
room here that will then soon turn it

27
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,869
into this that will then cause it to go

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,030
through and produce more parasites to

29
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:04,170
infect other horn rooms however you see

30
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,939
one that looks like this you want to

31
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,700
remove it and crush it and kill it feed

32
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,219
it to chickens to basically prevent it

33
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,719
from eating your tomato plants how you

34
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,219
can you prevent these well insect

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,530
netting is one way to add a physical

36
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,929
barrier or it is simple control and

37
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,049
remove them than non parasitized horn

38
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,280
worms white flies are small flies that

39
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,080
are white so that's kind of where they

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,969
get to her name how to prevent them

41
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,950
reflective mulches can help deter them

42
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,560
and how to control them many times

43
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,390
controls not needed as I've seen heavily

44
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,090
infested tomato plants with minimal

45
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,950
reduction in yield biological control

46
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,630
options are available such as green lace

47
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,490
wings big eyed bugs and privet bugs can

48
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:47,789
be ways to help combat these on an

49
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:50,009
insect insect combat level aphids are

50
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,630
very small they can be black tan white

51
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,609
or almost clear specks you're almost

52
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:56,699
like a tannish yellowish color they're

53
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:59,218
typically bigger concern from August on

54
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,478
that later portion of the season and if

55
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:04,559
you're inspecting an area you see a lot

56
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,599
of bumblebees in the area tends to avoid

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,390
of any flowers it's likely they have an

58
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,669
aphid feeding on the leaf structure we

59
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,250
usually see this sugary SAP that the

60
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:15,049
bees will feed on

61
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,699
how to prevent these well reflectively

62
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,189
block or insect netting would be an

63
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:20,929
option they can be very difficult to

64
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:23,359
control despite their small sizing

65
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,069
behind the numbers garlic based sprays

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,050
can help repel them and biological

67
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,289
control such as green lace wings can

68
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,209
also help reduce their numbers well a so

69
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:33,769
you can look at couple arms their

70
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,080
caterpillars feeding on seedlings that

71
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,240
recently planted in the field they

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,640
literally cut the plants down clean

73
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,830
fields well at the end of the season to

74
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,239
the previous growing year collar planted

75
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,270
these are physical barriers which is a

76
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,909
paper club or dichotomous Earth's the

77
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,890
diatomaceous earth these are two ways

78
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:54,039
you can add a physical barrier if you're

79
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:56,809
known to have cut wounds in a particular

80
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,280
planting site you also want to tell the

81
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,530
soil at least two weeks before planting

82
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,419
because this will help expose these cut

83
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,439
worms to the surface and hopefully

84
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,439
reduce their numbers
