1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
now with any growing setup you want to

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,400
be able to monitor your conditions you

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,899
want to be monitoring your condition

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,730
there's a variety of ways you can do

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,320
that but keep in mind that when you're

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,609
monitoring conditions you'll also be a

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,710
lis concerned with the unit's that

8
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,388
you're using be familiar with the unit's

9
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,130
you're using while you're using them and

10
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:20,789
what they tell you what the expected

11
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:22,469
range is for the given unit so we're

12
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,310
gonna go over some common ones here EC

13
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:28,410
TDS CF and ppm this is EC referring to

14
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,839
electrical connectivity total dissolved

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,429
solids conductive factor in parts per

16
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,100
million some of these are

17
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:38,759
interchangeable terms like from inches

18
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,640
to centimeters so be again mindful of

19
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:44,878
what you're using and what it measures

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,739
so if a monitor or an example of one is

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,750
called a bluelab guardian monitor and

22
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,119
this is an easy monitor to look at three

23
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,799
critical conditions all at once it's

24
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,780
very useful for hydroponics and for

25
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,849
those using easy cloners you can see the

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,980
connectivity you can switch between in

27
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,399
parts-per-million as this is set here I

28
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,679
can also go to TDS or EC or CF because

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,189
those are interchangeable terms

30
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,090
temperature you can measure in

31
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:12,449
Fahrenheit and Celsius and pH is a nice

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,130
six point five here so these nutrient

33
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,478
concentrations is that's basically what

34
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:17,908
we're going to be keeping an eye on in

35
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,500
monitoring our nutrients or salts which

36
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,240
can be measured based on the ability to

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,549
conduct electricity through a solution

38
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,739
the higher the concentration the more

39
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,960
conductivity they'll more diluted the

40
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,449
less conductivity so starting with

41
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,089
electrical conductivity EC pure water

42
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,460
such as reverse osmosis as an EC of zero

43
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,250
however the mineral ions added the more

44
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,039
readily the water will conduct that's

45
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,228
again kind of sending a pulse to the

46
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,969
electricity through to see what how

47
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,429
quickly it passes through the solution

48
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,349
the sieve your nutrient solution is

49
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,850
fairly reliable measure and how much

50
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:51,478
general nutrients are dissolved in your

51
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:53,158
water

52
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,659
ec is the most widely accepted

53
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,670
measurement for the strength of nutrient

54
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,350
solutions and is the standard in Europe

55
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,579
in many other parts of the world but

56
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,009
typically for whatever reason North

57
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,478
America tends to like TDS total

58
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,250
dissolved solids but there's a couple

59
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:09,270
more issues with that one when compared

60
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,560
to EC the total dissolved solids I think

61
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,200
it's easy to understand at least the

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,830
initial name it's the amount of solids

63
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,289
dissolved

64
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,060
solution ETS qualifies the concentration

65
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:20,579
of these diluted salads in a given

66
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,289
aqueous solution the problem though with

67
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,670
TDS is that accurately measuring the

68
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:25,679
nutrient solution you really need to

69
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,419
evaporate all the liquid and measure the

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,890
residue which kind of goes against

71
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:30,929
having a nutrient solution in the first

72
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:32,039
place there's also conversion factors

73
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,439
and it can get messy

74
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,209
so even though this is typically widely

75
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,990
used by a lot of growers may not

76
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,570
necessarily be the best CF or condone

77
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,670
factor is basically the same as EC

78
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,979
because it tells you the exact same then

79
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,259
it's how stronger or how concentrated

80
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,609
your feed solution is then they both

81
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,560
measure the rate of electrical

82
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,730
connectivity in your solution the higher

83
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
the mineral content higher the

84
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:59,579
conductivity rating so that's why if you

85
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:03,359
notice back on the lat I'm the blue lab

86
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,459
Guardian EC / CF it's that easy / CF

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,400
it's easy or CF both kind of

88
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,450
interchangeable terms in this case

89
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,640
lastly we have parts-per-million and

90
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:13,439
press vermilion is referring the

91
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,329
concentration of solution or minerals in

92
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,569
the water to put parts per million to

93
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:21,450
perspective a 1% solution or one out of

94
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:24,389
100 solution is the same solution

95
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:26,129
containing 10,000 parts per million so

96
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,319
we had 1 out of 100 is the same as

97
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,539
10,000 out of a million kind of it's

98
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,849
here 1 million black dots or pixels each

99
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:35,039
tile with white or gray background

100
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:37,709
contains a thousand dots it's going to

101
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,539
be the concept or the idea of exactly

102
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,539
what a million may look like
