1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
okay we're looking at niche or niche

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,469
iearned competition so niche is

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,289
referring to the pattern of living and

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:12,750
these organisms and species are all

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,570
interacting and have different patterns

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,579
of living are all in competition for a

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,890
limited amount of resources how these

8
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:23,429
kind of interrelate is very important to

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,899
an ecosystem so looking at communities

10
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,759
let's first to find a community well all

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,919
organisms that live together in an area

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,689
are defined as a community if you might

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,329
be a little hard to define because like

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,859
what type of area or what size or scale

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,450
of area are we talking about

16
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,969
but for communities the different

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,309
species compete and cooperate with each

18
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,230
other to make a community stable a

19
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,238
community is often identified by the

20
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,069
presence of a dominant species the

21
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,769
distribution of other organisms may

22
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,869
greatly differ however the ranges of all

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,270
organisms overlap we see that here with

24
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:57,780
our trees and our shrubs in our ferns

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,219
and salamanders all kind of overlap at

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,980
one another as part of this these

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,629
communities now this niche and

28
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,179
competition will a niche is a particular

29
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:08,280
biological role of an organism in a

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,130
community this is not to be confused

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,010
with habitats so habitats a place a

32
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,989
niche is it referred to as a pattern of

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,579
living so we see all these different

34
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:19,589
birds beaks have different niches

35
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:23,849
different patterns of living that can

36
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,469
help them consume unique food items so

37
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:26,188
habitat versus niche a good comparison

38
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,900
between the two

39
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:29,699
well habitat is a portion of an

40
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,520
ecosystem occupied by a particular

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,530
organism it's a physical place and it

42
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,629
reflects the living place of an organism

43
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,849
a niche on the other hand is the role of

44
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:42,509
an organism in that ecosystem so the

45
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,789
role is a function or activity and it

46
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,680
reflects the biotic and abiotic

47
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:49,290
associations with the environment so

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,820
comparing habitats to niche communities

49
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,820
like the physical place and this is a

50
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,129
function or activity so we're kind of

51
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:59,188
looking at environment now habitat in

52
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:01,438
niche you kind of see this stacking doll

53
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:02,699
effect here so the environment is the

54
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,408
overarching thing and that's everything

55
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,170
surrounding an organism that's the air

56
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,750
the rocks the water all of that is the

57
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,039
environment a little bit smaller than

58
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,650
that a little bit more specifically the

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,469
habitats motifs is a physical place its

60
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,349
area in the environment where organisms

61
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:22,469
grow and survive this could be the ocean

62
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:24,719
habitat the forest habitat the Arctic

63
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:26,878
that's a portion of the total

64
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,120
environment within the habitat there's a

65
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,340
smaller portion here where we're over

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,019
here when we're looking at the portion

67
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,079
of the habitat where the living organism

68
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:39,000
makes its home so this is referring to

69
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:41,010
that living it's a part of that habitat

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,340
part of that physical place and it's how

71
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:46,289
that interaction is occurring so

72
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,598
competition is a struggle of two organiz

73
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:50,400
to use the same resources where

74
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:52,348
resources are limited here we see

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,329
individuals competing for mates and

76
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:57,388
competition there's a limited number of

77
00:02:54,329 --> 00:03:00,299
amount of food water and mates as is

78
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:04,079
resulting in often competition that

79
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,159
occurs on most animal species now

80
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,500
there's two different types of

81
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:09,120
competition there's intra specific

82
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,060
competition which occurs between

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,700
individuals of the same species here so

84
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,489
intra is between the same species same

85
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:20,219
signal species interspecific competition

86
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,620
occurs between individuals of different

87
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,500
species so here receive a line in the

88
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,230
hyena these are different species here

89
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,848
this is interspecific competition here

90
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:34,619
we see two flamingos competing this is

91
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:36,268
intra sniffing competition now there's a

92
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,879
fundamental versus realized niche

93
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,829
because of competition organisms may not

94
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,899
be able to occupy their fundamental or

95
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,540
theoretical niche this is where an

96
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,849
organism can live so a fundamental niche

97
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,429
is referring to where an organism can

98
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:53,098
live we see this rock here you see these

99
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,549
barnacles and organisms living on this

100
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:58,888
rock well the fundamental niche is where

101
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,989
Northam might be able to survive however

102
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,939
this is often not the case

103
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,359
just because an origin can live there

104
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,709
doesn't mean it does live there instead

105
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,299
organisms often occupy what's called

106
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:10,949
their realized or their actual niche

107
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,439
this is where the organism actually

108
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,269
lives so some of these organisms for

109
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,788
example sink the light brown one here

110
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,408
kind of the blue one the light brown may

111
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:21,329
be able to live on this entire

112
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:23,759
intertidal zones this is the high tide

113
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,060
mark and then as the tide goes out this

114
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,689
is the low tide mark so this brown

115
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,149
organism maybe it'll live

116
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,370
the entire Rock however it gets out

117
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:34,709
competed from this white to gray and

118
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,840
this blue one so therefore it's realized

119
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:39,089
niche or it's active actual niche where

120
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,119
it lives is on the just below the high

121
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:45,269
tide line the fundamental niche could be

122
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,040
for the entire intertidal zone here but

123
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,829
it's realized or its actual image here

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,270
is just near the high tide line

125
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:53,909
countries to that the blue and green

126
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:55,829
kind of some of the Pink's they also may

127
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,380
be to live over this entire Rock but

128
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,609
they be out competed here maybe need to

129
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:01,290
have a little bit more moisture a little

130
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,290
bit more water therefore they're

131
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:08,270
realized niche is here very close to the

132
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:11,430
low tide mark so this in interspecific

133
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:12,839
competition with only one winner we see

134
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,280
the example here of blue and red we have

135
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,659
two different species competing so we

136
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,969
see initially they all start off and

137
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,040
then slowly at species one the red

138
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,680
species starts out compete species two

139
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,620
and we see over time the blue species

140
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,170
actually gets pushed out entirely and

141
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,420
only the red species one survives also

142
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,069
in that picture here we see the brown

143
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,540
living with the white walls for whatever

144
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,009
reason the white can out-compete the

145
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,660
brand and it gets pushed out and

146
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:39,409
therefore there's only one winner in

147
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,910
this interspecific competition

148
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,370
competitive exclusion can partly explain

149
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,919
this no two species with the same niche

150
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,649
can coexist so we see what is called

151
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,079
blue species here and we have a tan

152
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,449
orange of species here when they're

153
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,529
grown separately we see one that's here

154
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,779
one less here different carrying

155
00:05:55,529 --> 00:06:01,889
capacity that's okay but both living in

156
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:03,119
able to survive they all grew alone in

157
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,620
different culture tubes

158
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,790
this is them just how they grow normally

159
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,470
all isolated now though we add something

160
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,629
different so this is competitive

161
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,940
exclusion we're now taking these or

162
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:18,000
mixing the populations so we're mixing

163
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:20,939
the blue species here with the tan

164
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,160
orange species so we notice that there's

165
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,889
a decline or extinction here of the tan

166
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,070
or orange species when they're to share

167
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,629
the same culture too so because it to

168
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:32,430
have different realized niches thus they

169
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:34,620
avoid competition when they're able to

170
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,709
coexist but when they're mixed together

171
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:41,280
here we see that one species can outlive

172
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:43,560
the other can out-compete the other

173
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,359
for food or resources do that

174
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,850
competition the overall Karen capacity

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,310
is reducing if it's just grown alone but

176
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,990
we see that that mixed population very

177
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,360
closely resembles the Luthor species

178
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,490
compared to the tan or orange pieces

179
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,319
here hopefully this helps explain a

180
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:02,300
little bit of niche and competition that

181
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,300
occurs in ecosystems all over the world
