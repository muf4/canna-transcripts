1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
this is a nice short and brief

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:06,150
description of the three survivorship

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:09,808
curves we can see them evident here we

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,240
have a type 1 type 2 and type 3 type 1

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:15,088
is exhibited by humans type 2 typically

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,670
by birds and type 3 by trees look at the

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,368
percentage of maximum life expectancy a

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,279
number of individuals surviving based on

9
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:25,198
a log scale so the survivorship curves

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,969
they provide a way to express age

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,609
distribution characteristics of the

12
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,710
population survivorship is a percentage

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,100
of an original population that survives

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,500
to a given age you know they said we had

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,620
these three different types type 1 is

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,019
mortality rises in post reproductive

17
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,738
years or individuals died later in life

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,020
and that the example of the human humans

19
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:51,089
type 2 survivorship curves mortality is

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,190
consistent throughout life which is

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,949
consistent with many bird species and

22
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:58,500
then there's type 3 more Telly's low

23
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:01,589
after establishment which means that

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,319
there's a large decline in the young so

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,329
not many survived to older age but once

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,000
you get to know that mid age many will

27
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,920
survive how does that look graphically

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,799
well as we can see here I'll hang out

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,259
with the humans appear type 1 is for

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,020
humans where you can see that the death

31
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,540
rate increases later in life down here

32
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:24,868
so further in time is when you're more

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:28,170
likely sadly to die some birds is a

34
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:31,200
pretty consistent year-to-year and frogs

35
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,930
on in this example many diver early in

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,579
life but then once it establish itself

37
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,310
then those two individuals that do

38
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,739
survive to this midpoint many of those

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,500
will survive it until the end there's a

40
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,868
steep drop-off early on at meet type 3

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,659
type 2 is that consistent or linear

42
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:50,938
decrease in type 1 is humans where we

43
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,359
having that kind of plateau you're very

44
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:57,118
likely survive to mid to older age I

45
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,340
want to reach that then the survivorship

46
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,200
curve will decline rapidly to there

47
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,170
towards the end although it gives you

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,710
just that quick organization explanation

49
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,989
of the 3 some Earthship curves and the

50
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:14,299
tapes and how that they look graphically

51
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,300
and also an explanation of each of them
