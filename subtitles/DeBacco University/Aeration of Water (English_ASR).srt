1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,068
so here we look at aeration of water

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,899
this may come across as really easy see

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:08,309
here we're just kind of pedal system

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,550
where we're kind of mixing and splashing

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:14,070
the water around adding oxygen and air

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,980
to that water to help keep it well

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,910
oxygenated but there's some citizens who

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,050
I'm going to describe it to you may not

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,500
be familiar with

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,000
so first awful large scale if we pumping

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,890
water into the air and letting gravity

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,368
cause it to fall back creating a passive

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,050
method of aeration it could be a really

14
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:32,759
strong pump I mean really high cost it

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,859
to fall back or can we just kind of

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,719
these smaller pumps here again adding

17
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,670
pumping it up and learning what kind of

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,039
fallback through gravity kind of in this

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,750
kind of passive form of iteration which

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,759
can be very effective and it's used a

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,628
lot for display purposes and fountains

22
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:52,549
to keep the water aerated in areas that

23
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:55,070
may be in public display such as parks

24
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:58,198
at the forum of aeration for growers

25
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,270
commonly used by injecting air into the

26
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,799
water this difficulties is an airstone

27
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,879
we're taking an air stone at the bottom

28
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,548
of the tank

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,590
using an air pump to pump water pump the

30
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,570
air down through a tube and then letting

31
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,850
the the air bubbles kind of come through

32
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,379
the water and mixing it that way this

33
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:15,919
uses oxygen that's naturally in the

34
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,118
environment and this depends on

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,950
increasing the water surface contact

36
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,109
with the atmosphere that's kind of how

37
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,340
you're helping aerate the water the

38
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:25,349
bubbles here are kind of for the most

39
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,030
part passing right through reaching the

40
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,158
surface and tests during that surface

41
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,780
and it's that surface contact at surface

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,350
stirring that's occurring that is

43
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,219
allowed an aeration process to occur

44
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:36,719
something you may not be familiar with

45
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,170
or may have heard of but that related to

46
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,478
this aspect is a use of electrolysis so

47
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,210
electrolysis of water is a decomposition

48
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,789
of water into oxygen hydrogen gas due to

49
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:49,618
the passage of electrical current what

50
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,359
happens to be of our water and we're

51
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,640
separating out into its hydrogen and

52
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,859
oxygen components by this process

53
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,140
electrolysis this creates very small

54
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:01,618
nano scale so really really small

55
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,030
bubbles that form how this looks here

56
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:05,218
and there's a comparison between an

57
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,259
airstone versus taking an active air

58
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:09,109
pump pumping air through here and a lot

59
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,000
of the bubbles pass through the water

60
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,590
causing a bubble effect here and then we

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,830
have the electrolysis it almost looks

62
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,140
like

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,660
like a small fog occurring underneath

64
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,609
the water on o2 grows marketed towards

65
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,620
growers in this twin star is also

66
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,760
marketed towards cream enthusiasts they

67
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,780
both kind of operate on the same

68
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:31,319
electrolysis form versus the air stone

69
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:33,180
the Oh to grow company they're a

70
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,769
division of oxygen research group and

71
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,840
their technology platform holds four

72
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,700
unique patents with their electrolysis

73
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,250
technique they claim 50% or more

74
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,289
dissolved oxygen and a standard bubbler

75
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,610
other slogans kind of interesting that

76
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:46,859
says get out of the Stone Age in the

77
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,380
sense that they feel their system is

78
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,490
creating these small nano bubbles

79
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:52,530
actively oxygen water much more

80
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,360
effectively than a typical air stone

81
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,789
does require a little bit of the setup

82
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,140
there's a cost involved with this

83
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:59,759
there's electricity required so these

84
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,069
are all things to consider as growers

85
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,349
include to youtube links down here

86
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,969
remember the in the description there's

87
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,039
a link to all these slides and click on

88
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:09,870
these links and see some of the company

89
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,419
info there I just wanted to provide you

90
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,370
with something when you're looking

91
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:16,589
actively aerating water prime may not

92
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,030
have thought of electrolysis and it

93
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,920
might be something worth consideration

94
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,750
because of the increased surface area

95
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,429
here of the producing of the native

96
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,430
bubbles if you're really looking at

97
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,450
maximizing the aeration and oxygen

98
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,450
you're adding to your water
