1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,068
okay here I'm gonna explain what fuzzy

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,080
logic is now fuzzy logic if you're

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:10,019
looking at carbon dioxide controllers

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,509
often it's listed your fuzzy logic mode

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,070
physiologic active and what does that

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,509
exactly mean now if you're finding

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,070
controllers that do have this an option

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,439
those tend to be the better controllers

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,118
and you'll understand why that is a

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,500
little bit behind the technology of

11
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,800
fuzzy logic

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,259
well first off standard controllers so a

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,859
standard co2 controller are either on or

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,059
off based on preset co2 levels so it's

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,640
kind of like flipping a light switch on

16
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,609
or off these do not allow enough time

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,859
for carbon oxide to mix with the air

18
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:43,079
standard logic co2 controllers are used

19
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,628
for co2 generators but are not efficient

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,670
to be used with bottle based systems so

21
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:51,119
this on and off the lights are on or off

22
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,160
with fuzzy logic though consider it to

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,140
be a light on a dimmer switch we're

24
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,839
having this variability or this banding

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,890
that can occur so this controller would

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,750
suppose a lot if they allow for that

27
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,340
precise control again he's heard of our

28
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,019
light example here we can those

29
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,240
precisely dialed in what that light

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,189
intensity should be it makes predictions

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,019
based on past events to create an

32
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:13,228
environment that hovers around the

33
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,539
target co2 level without large degrees

34
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:17,640
of variation that includes large degrees

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,439
of overshooting or a large degrees under

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,239
shooting the other thing important

37
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,758
remember that fuzzy logic cannot be used

38
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,589
with su 2 generators only for bottle-fed

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,719
systems so when you're looking at a

40
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,700
controller might say here says true

41
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,069
fuzzy logic that can be something

42
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,659
preferable to look at and consider when

43
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,359
purchasing the controller for your own

44
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,009
operation so fuzzy logic relate to

45
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,469
temperature because that has many

46
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,269
applications essentially it can allow

47
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,640
for variable conditions that can be a

48
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:47,188
mix of different situations rather than

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,140
simply being on or off see the example

50
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:51,629
here with temperature instead of just

51
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,849
having hot or cold options there can be

52
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,679
a mix to get this warm to generate a

53
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:57,328
warm water

54
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,340
combination here so again fuzzy logic

55
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:01,559
instead of being on or off hot or cold

56
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,009
it allows that kind of that mixing to

57
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,680
occur here to have that kind of warm

58
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:09,929
temperature possibility the fuzzy logic

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,969
concept can be compared also to a good

60
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,860
driver so good drive approaches a red

61
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,259
light will apply the brakes

62
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,600
slow down before getting to the

63
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:21,179
intersection physiologic uses the same

64
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,889
idea to bring the co2 levels up to the

65
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,780
desired setting without going over the

66
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:27,869
set if we're looking at a standard

67
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,879
controller and the driver example here

68
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,700
the brakes would either be fully on or

69
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,799
fully off be kind of one option or the

70
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:38,129
other that fuzzy logic allows for that

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,310
greater gradual kind of control over the

72
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:43,939
situation here versus is on or off

73
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,740
that's it helps make them more efficient

74
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:48,810
these micro processors so within this

75
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,060
unit is a microprocessor processor that

76
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,069
can apply calculations to the injection

77
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,560
schedule to maintain co2 levels

78
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,969
efficiently standard logic controllers

79
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,280
will not make these calculations and

80
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,109
they'll continue to inject more and more

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,360
co2 until the room reaches the setpoint

82
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,489
and then turn them off but at that point

83
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,470
the air wasn't mixed properly that

84
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,730
caused an overshoot and then it can drop

85
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:10,709
down to a certain level and keep

86
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,359
injecting keep injecting that can cause

87
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,719
some issues having this microprocessor

88
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,800
this applying calculations ensures that

89
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,379
while they might be more expensive

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,410
initially it can help ensure that the

91
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:25,379
co2 that is being added to the the grow

92
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:28,259
room is added an efficient manner based

93
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,689
on calculations of the conditions over

94
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:33,629
time and this is why they're advised to

95
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:35,939
be used for growers to find a controller

96
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:37,859
if you're adding co2 from a bottle to

97
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,939
get the ones that have the fuzzy logic

98
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,940
mode as an option
