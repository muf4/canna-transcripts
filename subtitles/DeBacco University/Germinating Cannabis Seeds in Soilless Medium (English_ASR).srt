welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,960
looking at germinating cannabis seeds

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,240
in soilless medium and kind of giving

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,638
you some

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,000
tips and advantages on why you would go

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,919
about

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,300
propagating your cannabis seeds in this

8
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:23,109
medium

00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:23,109
[Music]

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,800
all right let's get started with the

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,559
video well first off it's important to

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
keep in mind of the basics for

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,960
germination no matter what substrate

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,799
media you're using certified seed source

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,960
these temperature moisture

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,799
air conditions how deep to plant your

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,719
seedlings and the light to provide them

18
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,640
at that early development stage

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,399
are all those germination basics you

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,320
need to keep in mind

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,000
so why would you use soils media what's

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,238
the advantage to using

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,159
stylus media well it can be purchased in

24
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,959
large quantities which is great

25
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,238
it's very easy to acquire typically and

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,320
when you do get it it is

27
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,919
disease and weed free so it makes for a

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,439
great starting material

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,198
it also has good water holding and

30
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,759
draining characteristics which is

31
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,280
very advantageous to growers to allow

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,079
those seedlings to establish themselves

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,359
quite well

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,438
it can be used in a variety of

35
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,118
containers which is great it's not

36
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,719
limiting to any one particular container

37
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,400
type a grower might be using

38
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,400
and growers can purchase specific blends

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,280
to best best match their needs as you

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,359
can see here

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,478
this one uh on this side says high

42
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,560
porosity

43
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,478
um so it's going to allow it to drain

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
and breathe very well typically maybe a

45
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,840
little bit better for a larger

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,799
um seed or to be used after the seedling

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,000
stage there

48
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,920
there's many different this is just

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,799
pro-mix it's just one example of the

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
many that are

51
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,759
out there the specifics when looking at

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,799
stairless media well regardless of the

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,359
manufacturer

54
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,640
a plug or germination mix should be used

55
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,040
and not a pot or

56
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
grow mix reason being is those plug or

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,680
germination mix will be made from a

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,040
finer material

59
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,920
to help ensure good seed to soil media

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
contact

61
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,840
while still providing air there's two

62
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,078
big air pockets in there

63
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,040
that seed could dry out or be at reduced

64
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,519
moisture level

65
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
and that could reduce your germination

66
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,239
percentage

67
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,800
and we could see just some comparisons

68
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,400
here of a finer material

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
down this way and a little bit coarser

70
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
material here so again you could use

71
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,879
that plugger germination mix just for it

72
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
says

73
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,878
the germination process and then

74
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,759
transition these seedlings to that grow

75
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,000
mix

76
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,840
or that pot or container mix when they

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,479
get a little bit older and don't need

78
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,598
that

79
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,598
fine material to allow for the

80
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,639
germination process anymore

81
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,399
now as the plant grows keep in mind that

82
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,000
plants can be upholded in a grower

83
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,439
potting mix could be used for this point

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,120
for in the grow cycle so you only want

85
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,719
to use that germination mix really

86
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,319
just to get them germinated typically in

87
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,239
those small trays it

88
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,159
packs in really well to the cells and

89
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,878
then you can continue to use the grill

90
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,799
or pot mix

91
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,878
for the duration once they have roots

92
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,719
for the duration of the growth cycle

93
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,439
there so that's your bulk media should

94
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,039
be that

95
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,878
and your germination next should only be

96
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,359
used during the germination process

97
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,399
to again help increase the odds of your

98
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,840
success

99
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,840
with your cannabis seeds
