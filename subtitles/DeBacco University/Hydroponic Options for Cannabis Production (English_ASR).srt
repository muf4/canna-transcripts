1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,880
the term hydroponics is a broad category

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:15,920
so here we look at some of the options

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:17,919
within the category of hydroponics

4
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,679
welcome to this tobacco university video

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,520
looking at hydroponic options for

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,439
cannabis production

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,879
so first off the hydroponic advantage

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,278
why are so many people looking

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,198
hydroponics and why is it so popular

10
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,039
well this is because if you dial in the

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,320
hydroponic system then the odds are

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,480
plants will grow faster

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,558
than if you're using soil which is part

14
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,238
of the reason for its popularity

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,238
the reason why this can happen is in

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,599
hydroponics and nutrients are directly

17
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,238
available to the plant

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
in the water solution in soil nutrients

19
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,159
often have to be converted

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
before uptake and are bound to particles

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,919
reducing the speed

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,079
of their variability other reasons why

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,840
hydroponics is that there is no soil to

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,558
need no media to need in that

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,359
instance it can get increased growth

26
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,558
rate and use

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,399
less water if you know the term

28
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,079
hydroponics means with water

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,159
there can be reduction in weeds to

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,798
almost zero nutrient efficiency and

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,799
potentially

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,799
use of less use of pesticides

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,840
now reasons against hydroponics because

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,200
they're not always

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
not even grows in hydroponics there's a

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,680
reason for that one of the drawbacks is

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
that

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
hydroponics is simply the upfront cost

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,280
in addition to the grower

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,439
needs to be sure that all conditions are

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,920
maximized on a continual basis

42
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,399
so there's a little less room for error

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,159
for example with ph

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
if the ph of the nutrient solution

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,640
changes or shifts which can occur

46
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,559
within a single day this could severely

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,359
damage the roots and cause stunting of

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,240
the actual

49
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,680
plants if left for longer than a day

50
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,319
this could result in the loss of the

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,640
crop

52
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,039
or just for a short period of time could

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,200
cause stunting and negative effects

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,240
this is because unlike soil there is no

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,759
buffer factor

56
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,158
so growers are responsible for

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,319
continually monitoring conditions

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,439
such as ph to ensure that everything is

59
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:06,239
within the expected tolerances or ranges

60
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,798
to maximize plant growth now as i

61
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,199
mentioned the

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,959
importance of ph with all hydroponic

63
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,199
systems growers must be mindful of the

64
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,159
ph of the solution at all times

65
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,839
so a continual monitor is important so

66
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,959
here we just see this is a blue labs a

67
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,560
guardian monitor

68
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,080
going through and just making sure we're

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
not having massive shifts

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,040
in anything here we do notice the ph

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,360
goes potentially from 7.2 to 7.0

72
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,639
all the way quickly to 6.2 yeah they are

73
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
changing we're looking at different

74
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,199
substrates here

75
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,799
but just keep in mind that sometimes it

76
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,560
can occur very fast

77
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,640
using a little ph strip is usually not

78
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
advised need a digital monitor with a

79
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,639
lot readout they can continually be

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,800
checking

81
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,598
to make sure you catch some even slight

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,280
changes very early on

83
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,719
now different substrates in hydroponic

84
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,439
production

85
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,959
there are a lot to choose from under the

86
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,479
category of hydroponics there are many

87
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,479
different substrates that can apply and

88
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,560
still be called hydroponics

89
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,079
sometimes there is no root supportive

90
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,360
substrate other times there are

91
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
however with all substrates for

92
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,280
hydroponic production typically they

93
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,239
only supply a physical structure for

94
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
their roots

95
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,439
and hold a varying degrees of water and

96
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,680
allow for aeration

97
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,479
the substrates themselves do not really

98
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,439
produce or

99
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,919
have a lot of nutrients to them popular

100
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,560
options

101
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,439
are clay pebbles our grow stones we see

102
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,000
here

103
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,479
coco choir and also rock wool or

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,560
sometimes

105
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,399
even quote no substrate and just kind of

106
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
using some rock pebbles here initially

107
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,439
and then growing the roots in kind of

108
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,120
this aquatic environment there

109
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,039
now within hydroponic systems there are

110
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,039
different systems that can be selected

111
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,439
that all qualify or are classified as

112
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,919
hydroponics such as deep water culture

113
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,039
ebb and flow indoor drip irrigation and

114
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,399
aeroponics

115
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,239
