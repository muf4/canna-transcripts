1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
so based on the title hopefully you've

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,200
clicked on this tobacco university video

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,039
looking to learn more information about

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,280
growing cannabis from clones

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:17,719
and that's what i tend to provide here

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:20,799
on this video

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,799
[Music]

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,800
let's get into some helpful tips on

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,278
growing cannabis from clones

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,839
well first off keep in mind that a clone

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,000
is an

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,159
exact copy clones are more properly

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,759
called asexual vegetative propagation

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,279
it's a common method of propagation for

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,439
cannabis as well as

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,039
other plants this isn't something that's

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,519
exclusive only to cannabis

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,878
can be done with many other plant types

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,960
if you want a good other plant to kind

20
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,199
of experiment with tomatoes make another

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,719
great example of learning or refining

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,640
your cloning procedure

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,399
the goal of cloning is to maintain an

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,878
exact chemical profile of the original

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,759
plant

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,399
which in some cases could be a genetic

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,359
isolate

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,039
meaning if you have something that's

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,039
really unique that you can't recreate

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,039
with a cross or growing more seeds

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,879
taking a clone is a great way to help

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,640
preserve that

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,560
so what's the basic cloning procedure

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,000
and again this can get more complicated

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,280
or less complicated but what's the basic

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,239
procedure

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
i'm going to give you a list of the

38
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,839
minimum materials that you need

39
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,039
many are present in a general growing

40
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,680
operation so if you're growing in

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,280
general

42
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,360
by all means you probably have many of

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,799
these how much resources you allocate

44
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,519
will depend on the scale of your

45
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,759
operation

46
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,280
and resources you have available to you

47
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,319
we can see in the images here

48
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,320
a simple kind of container here a

49
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,478
seeable container can work

50
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,679
we could see a lot of variability here

51
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,039
probably not the best if you're looking

52
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,400
at having a large scale operation you

53
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,759
kind of want to make things efficient

54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
but this just gives you an example of

55
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,840
how simple it potentially can be you

56
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,240
don't have to over complicate it

57
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
so what's the simple and basic material

58
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,798
list well you want a stock or mother

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
plant

60
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
male plants can be cloned for breeding

61
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,079
purposes but typically it really

62
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,158
is not done however the plant material

63
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,599
should not be in autoflower so keep that

64
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,719
in mind if you are growing autoflowers

65
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,839
typically you don't want to be going

66
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,839
through and cloning that

67
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
i have another video explaining why that

68
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,439
is the case we have a knife or even a

69
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,239
sharp scissors will work and that's how

70
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,239
you're going to

71
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,079
go through and take your clone running

72
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,479
hormone will help increase the success

73
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,120
rate

74
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
of your clone to produce roots in the

75
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
propagation

76
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,959
environment you're looking at typically

77
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,959
diffused light typically

78
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,199
under 300 par micro moles of light

79
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,479
a relatively high relative humidity

80
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,238
around 90 percent

81
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,479
attempt around 70 to 82 degrees

82
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,000
fahrenheit or 25 to 28 degrees

83
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,878
celsius now rooting in clones

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
uh clones will form evan tissues roots

85
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,919
and will lack essential

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
taproot that forms when you're starting

87
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,359
with seeds so if you're

88
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,200
accustomed to starting with seeds and we

89
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,840
have this nice strong radical or tap

90
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,919
root

91
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
clones will not develop this strong tap

92
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,439
root they develop a whole bunch of

93
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,318
advantageous roots off of the side

94
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,959
of the stem so they have a much more

95
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,719
branched

96
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,039
appearance much more branched structure

97
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,479
very early on so just keep that in mind

98
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,239
if you're used to doing seeds and

99
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,919
going over to clones it's going to be a

100
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,439
little bit different but with some of

101
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,719
the tips here

102
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,039
going over some of the processes

103
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,560
hopefully you can be quite successful

104
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,479
and it's good to have this technique in

105
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,158
case you do find that one genetic

106
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:16,799
isolate plant that you want to have

107
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,799
more of cloning is the way to go
