1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,120
this is something a lot of growers may

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,200
not want to admit to

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,520
but the threat of burning their plants

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,599
with over application of nutrients

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:16,350
this debaco university video is going to

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:19,278
cover just that

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,400
[Music]

8
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,480
all right let's get in the threat of

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,320
nutrient burn to cannabis plants

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,640
so most growers tend to over fertilize

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
their plants nutrient burn is typically

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,679
a grower induced error

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,439
when they do not properly calculate the

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,679
nutrients needed by the plants

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,200
or think they need a little bit more

16
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,799
also growers typically think more

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,200
fertilizer can fix a wide range of

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,558
problems when it actually may cause more

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,800
than it would solve in this kind of leaf

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,558
structure here this kind of burning here

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,399
is evidence that maybe they over added

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:48,959
the nutrients to this small growing

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,640
plant

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,079
and caused it kind of to get this kind

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,198
of crinkled or stunted

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,280
look to it now you want to avoid

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,039
nutrient toxicity so follow

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,039
manufacturer's recommendations

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,559
know the ph values and concentrations of

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,558
your nutrient solution

31
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,158
favor on the low side and work to higher

32
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,359
concentrations after you see how the

33
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,200
plants react

34
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,118
if you go through an over add it can be

35
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,240
just the same negative effect as if you

36
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,840
were to under add

37
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,759
it is a whole lot easier to add a little

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,359
bit more than to try to take a little

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,040
away

40
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,959
now i want to be mindful to recognize

41
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,920
deficiencies and there's many of these

42
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,679
charts that exist

43
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,439
know what certain deficiencies look like

44
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,080
will help you ensure you can correct

45
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:27,839
problem

46
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,959
problems early on giving you the

47
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
confidence that you can identify

48
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,599
something early

49
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,439
so that you don't get into that chance

50
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,319
of reaching those toxic

51
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,000
or excessive levels in a plant tobacco

52
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,798
university also has more

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,040
cannabis specific videos on recognizing

54
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,280
nutrient deficiencies

55
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,200
you also want to know your fertilizers

56
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,599
so many fertilizers have a blend of

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,439
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and pk

58
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,519
so do not make application for one

59
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,478
nutrient without considering the other

60
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,679
nutrients

61
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,679
meaning if you calculate the amount of

62
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,799
fertilizer to add for 120 parts per

63
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,719
milliliter of nitrogen

64
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,960
which if you're learning how to do that

65
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,718
search tobacco university for that

66
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,239
do not forget about the phosphorus and

67
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,399
potassium as this could lead to an

68
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,799
over-application of these nutrients

69
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,039
if you're only focusing in calculating

70
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
for nitrogen

71
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,318
also you want to be sure you have

72
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,759
specialty fertilizers on hand it may be

73
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,119
a good idea to have some fertilizers

74
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,878
that are nutrient specific

75
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,400
to ensure as a grower you can dial in a

76
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:23,919
fertilizer program if there's a

77
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,360
deficiency notice

78
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,519
this is recommended for at least

79
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,680
nitrogen and calcium magnesium should

80
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,360
have some specialty fertilizers on there

81
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,879
because this is typically something very

82
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,000
quick you need to add

83
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,359
and something cannabis plants require

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,598
you also want to know fertilizers

85
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
compatibility so we have some just some

86
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,719
example charts here

87
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,400
some fertilizers can be mixed while

88
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,159
others have reduced solubility and

89
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
others simply are incompatible

90
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,840
test your mix before adding it to your

91
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,878
plants and consult one of these charts

92
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,479
ahead of time

93
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,079
so you know you don't waste your time

94
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,840
making an incompatible uh

95
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,920
mix this just gives you some of the

96
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,560
various common fertilizers that might be

97
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,479
added

98
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
what's what's compatible what has

99
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,238
reduced solubility

100
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,519
and what is simply incompatible there so

101
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
be mindful of this

102
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,039
before you go through mixing fertilizers

103
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,799
so you don't do more harm

104
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,079
than good to the plant because if you

105
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,959
mix these two together and just go

106
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,560
through and apply it

107
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,640
you could cause nutrient burn if you

108
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,239
over apply it could cause nutrient burn

109
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,479
so just ensure that you're giving the

110
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,158
plants what they need not anymore

111
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,000
keep them at optimum level and they'll

112
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,000
be at the peak of efficiency
