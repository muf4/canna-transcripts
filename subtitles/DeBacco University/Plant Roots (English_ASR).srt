1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,278
Huber has been some time going over a

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,740
little bit more in depth of plant roots

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,379
this is a great image that I took of one

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,809
of the plants that I was growing showing

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,570
you what the roots look like below the

6
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:17,219
soil line you can see here a lot of kind

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,469
of root hairs that are protruding here

8
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,698
increasing the surface area allowing for

9
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:25,198
efficient water and nutrient absorption

10
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:26,970
so continuing on roots in general they

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,250
anchor the plant and they absorb water

12
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,108
and minerals in solution it's important

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,750
in solution needs to be in a water

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,480
solution see here for anchoring the

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,429
plant like mangoes grown down in Florida

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,049
it helps support this tree and this is

17
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,729
what Dale is like kind of growing in the

18
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,128
soil here and some are protruding up

19
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:46,259
above the soil then continuing down all

20
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,210
these are help anchoring the plant and

21
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,939
also observing water and minerals for

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,410
the planet so we spent a little time on

23
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,909
this slides might be a little initially

24
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:57,898
complex but I want you to focus it on

25
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:00,779
two points here so we have the xylem

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,929
here we're looking at getting water in

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,420
minerals into the xylem and we do this

28
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:09,090
through our roots particularly our root

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,549
hairs those fine structures and there's

30
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,340
two main ways that we can get water and

31
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,470
minerals uptake through the roots so one

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,540
here and get in no particular order we

33
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,400
have this in plastic group this involves

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,060
transport of water in males through the

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,969
symplast

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,060
or cell cytoplasm which is linked by

37
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:30,239
plasmodesmata plasmodesmata are holes

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,640
literally holes within the cell walls so

39
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,199
if we follow this blue root here we

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,570
notice that we're entering the cytoplasm

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,659
of the cell and were crossing through

42
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,158
the holes in the cell membrane and we

43
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,729
see one through here going through here

44
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,040
ultimately getting to our xylem so again

45
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,750
the symplastic group involves

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,320
transporting water and minerals from the

47
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,209
symplast

48
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,798
or cell cytoplasm now to contrast that

49
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:57,989
we're here going to look at the apple

50
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,030
plastic group this involves transporting

51
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:02,759
water in minerals with the apple plast

52
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,579
which includes the cell walls the xylem

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,239
in the intercellular space between cells

54
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:10,739
suno's these this route and say for

55
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,810
water in minerals it's a little bit

56
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,830
different we're noticing we're not going

57
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,590
in the cytoplasm here

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,140
we're going literally through the cell

59
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,000
walls and to get to their xylem here

60
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,759
staying within cell walls in the space

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,020
between those the intracellular space to

62
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,639
get ultimately to our xylem now within

63
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,490
the roots we have something called this

64
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,489
endodermis here in this kasparian strip

65
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:39,870
so within all roots we have this and

66
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:42,480
this is a waxy barrier so we're in the

67
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,939
lipid family here in the ewa plus that

68
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,560
force anything in the upper class to

69
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,310
cross the cell membrane for filtration

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,039
before entering the next step so we'll

71
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,300
notice that this is a barrier here so

72
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,609
we're allowing some water minerals to

73
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,390
come in but there is kind of a physical

74
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,760
check that allows or prevents certain

75
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:05,039
materials from getting through

76
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,199
remember our xylem here after the dead

77
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,789
part the apple plast or the bulk flow up

78
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,729
to the roots and i see this arrow going

79
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:14,250
up because remember xylem goes from the

80
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:16,259
roots to the chutes so that's what we're

81
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,419
following here so again just to recap

82
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,969
quickly some plastic roots going through

83
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:22,649
the cytoplasm and the apple plastic root

84
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,959
is live ago and we'll right along the

85
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,030
cell walls here and remember our

86
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,039
Kasparian strip is that waxy barrier

87
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,800
particularly for the apple plastic group

88
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,349
belong in filtration before getting into

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,750
this item hopefully that wasn't too bad

90
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,639
there for getting into the water and

91
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,159
mineral uptake for roots to get into the

92
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,509
xylem let's look a little bit more

93
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,159
deeper here at our root structure

94
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:45,679
there's gonna be three regions I'm going

95
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,150
to focus on a little bit more detail

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,219
area of cell division elongation and

97
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,510
maturation

98
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:53,009
so it's a very tip we have something

99
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:55,169
called the root cap and that's evident

100
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:57,479
right here this protects the newly

101
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,949
forming root tips it secretes a

102
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:00,899
lubricant to aid in the movement of the

103
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,849
root tip through the soil where these

104
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,670
root tips are actively growing this is

105
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:08,699
one of those apical meristems this is it

106
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:11,399
magnified about a hundred times and see

107
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,500
the meristem and we see some dead cells

108
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,139
in the elongation zone kind of working

109
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,600
our way up here we're focused right now

110
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,789
on this area the root cap and this is

111
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,520
kind of protecting all our recently

112
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,950
dividing cells here as this pushes its

113
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,419
way through the soil and you could see

114
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,360
here this is

115
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,420
meristem and the numbers are listed

116
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,710
should be 1 2 3 4 and 5 this elongation

117
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,840
zone I'm going to focus a little bit

118
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:38,789
more detail realized the meristem the

119
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,479
highest rate of mitosis occurs at this

120
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,819
number 1 right here now this area of

121
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,920
cell division the root apical meristem

122
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:48,959
is located right here is protected by

123
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,650
their root cap against allow that root

124
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,689
to kind of push through the soil working

125
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:56,729
our way back from the root tip we have

126
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:58,980
the area of elongation so our cells

127
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,180
expand in length cells are not actually

128
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,310
being moved through the soil here

129
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,689
they're just expanding only the root

130
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,790
captain marathons are the ones actually

131
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:08,430
pushing through the soil here our cells

132
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,770
are simply just expanding area of

133
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,069
maturation so our cells are kind of

134
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:15,719
getting more mature getting more

135
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,490
specialized in their structures and we

136
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,950
see the evidence of root hairs beginning

137
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,210
to develop and these are side shoots to

138
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,029
the root that can increase in surface

139
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:25,649
area for better absorption our vascular

140
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,349
similar here remember that's our xylem

141
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:29,609
and phloem kinda puts it all together

142
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,930
you can see I just simply took this

143
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,939
image and broken apart in different

144
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,980
areas you should be familiar with each

145
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:38,339
and what occurs in each of these three

146
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:41,310
areas mycorrhizae that I mention in the

147
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,319
previous video also micros is a fungus

148
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,149
roots called C here what it looks like

149
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,459
when the root has a micro rising

150
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:49,679
Association versus one when it does not

151
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,329
this helps increase the surface area of

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,790
roots to absorb nutrients in the water

153
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:56,159
in the soil one particular nutrient of

154
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,990
no is phosphorus phosphorus does not

155
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,300
move very much in the soil so it's kind

156
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,160
of fixed in place so this mycorrhizae

157
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,860
that's beneficial on this helps increase

158
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,200
the surface area it can help the plant

159
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,439
uptake phosphorus particular if it's low

160
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,599
in soils this increased web or netting

161
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,569
increases the contact increasing the

162
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,430
likelihood that these fungus will come

163
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:19,469
and talk type with phosphorus that can

164
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,180
take it up to the plant and remember the

165
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,250
plant in return gives the fungus some

166
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,810
sugars had it made up in the leaves and

167
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,319
this is a true symbiotic relationship

168
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,420
focusing a little bit more on that

169
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,310
caspian strip that i mentioned there a

170
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,560
cellular feature found in roots of all

171
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,540
higher plants the caspian strip is a

172
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,000
waterproof barrier you see that evident

173
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,100
right here chemicals must cross the

174
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,050
Caspian strip to enter the xylem

175
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,770
access a little bit of a barrier and a

176
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:48,900
wave to filter since we see the Apple

177
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:50,519
plastic root in the symplastic root here

178
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,370
remember some plastic is going through

179
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:56,519
the plasmodesmata their simple holes in

180
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,740
the cell wall we have a plastic roots

181
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,029
traveling kind of on the side here this

182
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,519
also shows you here the plasma there's

183
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:04,169
mothers holes in the cell wall and then

184
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,539
our Apple pleasant press pathway is

185
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,400
literally through the cell versus the

186
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,900
symplastic pathway named through the

187
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:14,459
cytoplasm just to be able to a quick

188
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,039
comparison be able to recognize when a

189
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:19,680
monocot root would look like versus a

190
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,210
herbaceous dicot remember herbaceous is

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,550
referring to plants that don't have a

192
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,799
woody stem woody dicot would be another

193
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,420
example so just be able to recognize

194
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,970
when a monocot looks like that central

195
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,460
kind of ringed here and herbaceous

196
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,410
die-cut kind of has that little T little

197
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,079
X that little kind of center small

198
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:40,070
circle region and then surrounded by a

199
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,539
bunch of cells here that K Center region

200
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:46,250
distinguishes a dicot from a large

201
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,250
center region here monocot root
