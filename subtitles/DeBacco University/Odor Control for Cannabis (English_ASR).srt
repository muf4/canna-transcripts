1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,439
I hear me looking at odor control for

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:05,969
cannabis now I want to keep in mind that

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,950
there's an odor control the final

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:11,129
product this is gonna focus on odor

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,769
control during the actual grow phases

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,660
through the plant odor controls more

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,760
important later in the stages early on

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,460
cannabis wall does have a distinct odor

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,859
will not necessarily be as pungent early

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,980
on but as it progresses and ages

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,220
typically around week six or so the odor

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,899
will become more prevalent so canvass an

13
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:33,238
order control well the air circulation

14
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,920
is needed it is not advised to be

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:36,929
directly exhausted air from your grow

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,350
facility due to this negative odor that

17
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:42,179
can be produced there's no harm in this

18
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,579
but the reason why you may want to

19
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,500
consider this odor control is if you're

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,969
in an area it could increase odds of

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,058
complaints that everyone enjoys the

22
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,198
smell of growing cannabis plants I think

23
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:54,269
that charcoal filter will drastically

24
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,718
reduce the pungent odor the cannabis

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,399
odor while you're exhausting air out so

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,530
you don't want to have a fan this scent

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,660
air directly out especially if in the

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,090
area where you could have a complaint so

29
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:08,310
that could arise there's an ozone

30
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,460
generator this converts oxygen ozone

31
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,920
which is o3 by exposing it to UV light

32
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:15,719
this could help reduce odors it changes

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,000
the charges of things it binds and

34
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,450
neutralizes with those odor molecules

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,879
and this reduction now does take up some

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,920
time for this ozone to come in contact

37
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,170
with these smelly cannabis particles

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,990
this can be prohibitive in areas that

39
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,150
have high areas of volume exchanges also

40
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:35,219
UV light is dangerous and so it's ozone

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,540
for both you and the plants so cautious

42
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,569
caution is advised if you're

43
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,549
implementing this type of system also

44
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:44,188
the oh three molecules are unstable only

45
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,890
lasts for about half an hour or so about

46
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,839
30 minutes and if you are using ozone

47
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,670
and it does somehow come in contact with

48
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,469
the plants and high doses that can

49
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,228
damage the plants or if it comes in kind

50
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:56,519
with the grower that can be another

51
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:59,250
caution because it couldn't damage

52
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,509
humans lung tissue as well so just be

53
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,159
cautious if you are looking at

54
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,799
implementing an ozone generator type

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,810
system for odor control what is more

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,759
advised is carbon filter for odor

57
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,800
reduction there should be installed for

58
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,449
operations through the entire grow they

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
said is most important for that week six

60
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,639
or on

61
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,889
so that's when odors tend to become more

62
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,359
of an issue be sure to size your system

63
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:20,848
accurately don't know something it's too

64
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,459
small you can favor going slightly

65
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:25,018
larger if you need to but be sure that

66
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,060
you have an idea of what size would be

67
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,830
recommended if you're not enriching with

68
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,719
co2 then you can easily increase the

69
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,360
power of the exhaust fan to compensate

70
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,169
for potential for reduced airflow when

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,519
you're running something through a

72
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:37,979
filter there will be reduced to airflow

73
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,080
and this not injecting with co2 you can

74
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,238
afford to kind of increase the rate

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,489
exhaustion of air and ventilation

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,180
without worrying about exhausting out

77
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:50,069
your precious carbon dioxide so this

78
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,870
activate chart charcoal filter we see

79
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:54,089
pictured here our surface areas

80
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,360
increased with oxygen open pores

81
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,840
increase the absorbing mists of the odor

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,190
and they typically can be covered here

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,379
so the carbon is on the inside

84
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:06,989
this as an extra filter here to ensure

85
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,120
clean air is being evacuated out of the

86
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,610
grow tent is mounted very high so I'm

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,519
exhaust in the hottest air as well and

88
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,470
represent virgin activated carbon this

89
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,719
was recommended to due to its very high

90
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,509
surface area and potential for the

91
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,969
longest life possible to maximize the

92
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:26,149
effectiveness of a activated charcoal

93
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:30,239
filter you want to keep the baby below

94
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:33,359
55% 65 to 72 will reduce performance and

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,069
80% plus stops performance what this

96
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:36,930
means is simply if you're running this

97
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:39,388
in an area with very high humidity such

98
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,969
as for a cloning area again they don't

99
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,350
have the pungent odor to begin with but

100
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:45,479
if you are looking at run that in area

101
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,939
with high humidity those high humidity

102
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,828
those moisture will kind of clog up and

103
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,840
eliminate some of the surface area there

104
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,689
for that carbon to act as they remove

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,219
the odors what I have the air moves

106
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,199
slowly through it and one of the over

107
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,759
sizing this fan and pulling it right

108
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,919
through and right out because you there

109
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:06,090
needs to be some contact time between

110
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,409
the odor and the activated carbon if you

111
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,019
use a pre-filter and that's what you see

112
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,759
here to remove particulate and change on

113
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,430
a regular basis about every 60 days

114
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,288
depending on the quality of air that

115
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,889
you're dealing with so again this is a

116
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,988
pre-filter

117
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,720
easily removed and will help protect and

118
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,699
extend the life of your activated carbon

119
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,680
on the inside so as you can see this is

120
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,849
for odor control your indicators plan to

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,850
help reduce

122
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,890
potential for complaints size is

123
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,170
important in life and that you're using

124
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:36,870
and exhausting dosing or not dosing

125
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,610
enriching with co2 is important so all

126
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,800
these factors come together but this is

127
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,509
just another thing to consider if you're

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,610
looking at trying to reduce the chance

129
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:46,769
of having complaints if you're growing

130
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,699
cannabis here with neighbors or people

131
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,699
nearby
