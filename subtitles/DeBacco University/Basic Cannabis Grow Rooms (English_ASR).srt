1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,259
so when producing cannabis to be

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,989
efficient growums may be divided into

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,250
different areas some basic rooms would

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,469
be a clone room a mother room a

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,048
vegetative room a flower room and a dry

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:14,879
a cure room so just some of the basics

7
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:16,649
gonna go over just an overview of what

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,929
each of these rooms may entail

9
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,368
so starting common to all of these rooms

10
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,278
should be cleanliness good air

11
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:25,618
circulation and monitoring systems wait

12
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,868
is to control different aspects and

13
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,309
environments within the room and ways to

14
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,980
check to make sure everything's working

15
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,890
and functioning properly the check

16
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,239
protocols is a great way to hopefully

17
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,609
notice that something's going awry very

18
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,399
early so it doesn't damage the crop

19
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:43,530
permanently rooms may not always be

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,120
physically separate so some operations

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,149
and this is typically the smaller ones

22
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,058
will have a dual purpose rooms this can

23
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,530
reduce the efficiencies and possibly

24
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:54,390
cause contamination and spread of

25
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,429
disease quicker when you have these dual

26
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,710
functional rooms and that's where

27
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,058
cleanliness is even more important older

28
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,070
plants with the younger plants and as

29
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,079
older plants may be sick or can carry

30
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,420
diseases potential insects and it could

31
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,298
infect the inner plants also lighting in

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,379
tendencies may need to be adjusted older

33
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,150
plants may not be getting enough light

34
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:13,859
while the other plants could be getting

35
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,780
too much light so it's kind of really

36
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,909
that one room kind of fits all and does

37
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,759
everything this is why typically there's

38
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,979
sections put into rooms and partitions

39
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,478
to allow them each to be treated

40
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,179
slightly differently to maximize

41
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,340
production the clone room so this is

42
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,500
also referred to as a propagation room

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,659
seeds can be started or clones can be

44
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,819
routed typically this room had higher

45
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,320
humidity than the others overall this

46
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,239
less intense light required you don't

47
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,339
want to burn other tender foliage and

48
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,599
this needs frequent monitoring that

49
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,359
especially if you're looking to clone

50
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,339
operations to make sure pH is kept well

51
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,409
make sure you're getting roots on your

52
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,030
clones here make sure your seedlings are

53
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,280
started because we're kind of starting

54
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,070
those plants at a very critical part of

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,070
the entire process and this is often one

56
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:00,839
that can be a little smaller because the

57
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:04,109
plants of course are smaller but needs

58
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,759
to have very careful monitoring so here

59
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:07,618
we're looking at the mother or stock

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,878
plant room this is where the mother or

61
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,520
stock plants are kept

62
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,469
so typically fewer but larger plants and

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
we want to remain in one of these plants

64
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:15,658
we

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,819
in a vegetative state so keep in mind

66
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:19,858
it's giving them 16 plus hours of

67
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:22,199
continuous light some growers may even

68
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:24,299
choose to run 24 hours this is often

69
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,949
where rare and unique genetics may be

70
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:28,980
kept so monitoring this area is

71
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:31,259
important security are also as a high

72
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,840
priority unique individuals have the

73
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:36,358
picture of the albino here it's found

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,000
that goal is to clone that plant to

75
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:41,340
produce many of those desired copies of

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,959
that offspring as a result I have this

77
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,218
picture here because growers may want to

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,930
choose to prune them a little bit

79
00:02:44,218 --> 00:02:47,729
differently want to increase the

80
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,829
branching to increase the availability

81
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:52,709
of clones that can be used for

82
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:54,180
propagation and the vegetative room this

83
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,759
is where plants are focused on growing

84
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,620
leaves a novelty flowers here keeping

85
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,810
that 16 plus hours continuous light is

86
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,579
important after the entire crop

87
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,530
otherwise if you cut that down below

88
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:07,169
that you run the risk of your entire

89
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,639
room going into flower prematurely some

90
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:10,530
growers again run even in this area in

91
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,209
24 hours of light but this often leads

92
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,459
to wasted light and diminishing returns

93
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,319
on investment because of the increased

94
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,989
cost associated running those lights

95
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,298
keep the plants well-fed this is very

96
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,889
important stage for development I'm sure

97
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,109
those plants are night stressed at all

98
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,449
I'm able to produce as many leaves as

99
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,829
possible here you can see these kind of

100
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:30,810
purple hue to these leaves and that's

101
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,000
because there's an LED light with that

102
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,209
purple heavy purple spectrum running in

103
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,739
this area of the vegetative room the

104
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,389
flower room I hear the foot appeared

105
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,400
should be adjusted to 12 hours late in

106
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,229
12 hours of darkness Wallace is coming

107
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,930
for two as the money room setting up

108
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:48,030
your plants well in the vegetative room

109
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,549
is important for their success during

110
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,509
the stressful flowering stage so I

111
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,009
noticed have kind of that you had a

112
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:54,988
yellow look to him so because of running

113
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:56,548
high pressure sodium lights this is

114
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,889
again often referred to as the money

115
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,530
room even though really setting this

116
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,569
plants up in the vegetative room is very

117
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,219
important to allow them to perform well

118
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:07,548
when they go into the flowering room or

119
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,989
the flowering stage of development

120
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:12,239
lastly the drying cure this is the last

121
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,799
stage of the process and controlled

122
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,688
inconsistent conditions are very

123
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,699
important you don't want to lose your

124
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,048
harvest this late in the season this

125
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,280
late in the game is you have the mass

126
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,138
amount of investment in your crop

127
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,059
keeping the lights as minimum as

128
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,400
possible and control over community are

129
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,689
very important you don't have mold

130
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,549
increased want to be

131
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,740
or that you're able to dry them

132
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,990
efficiently and effectively so you get

133
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,990
the maximum return on your investment
