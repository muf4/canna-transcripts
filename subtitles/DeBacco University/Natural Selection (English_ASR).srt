1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,079
here we're going to be looking at some

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,240
of the details behind natural selection

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,669
natural selection here might be familiar

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,379
with the finches and the birds beaks and

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,359
also with these two different colored

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,089
moths and how they're able to survive in

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,579
different environments so first off well

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,339
how does a biological evolution happen

9
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,679
well there's two main ideas on how

10
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,539
traits or genes can be passed on to the

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,329
next generation one theory is that

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,820
individuals evolve where inherence

13
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,979
acquired characteristics are somehow

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,350
passed on to the offspring or the

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,170
concept that with these leaves being at

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,789
the highest point on these trees because

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,189
giraffes stretch their necks to

18
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,200
constantly eat those individuals evolved

19
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,780
to have kind of longer necks that then

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,640
go on to the next generation that ends

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,558
up being the case what doesn't have

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,989
happening is a theory of populations

23
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,689
evolving and this is a selection of

24
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:56,519
genes already within a population

25
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:58,829
changes within those genes frequencies

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,440
in a population leads to that change

27
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,878
over time in this example we just have

28
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,588
some giraffes that are just naturally

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,868
born taller because they're able to

30
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:08,670
acquire food easier they're able to

31
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,409
survive or more likely to survive

32
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,170
therefore they pass their genes on to

33
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,299
the next generation in that way so we

34
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,189
can also see this with human directed

35
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,100
selection through domestication of

36
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:21,839
animals and plants Shifa is an example

37
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,849
of domesticating animals we could see

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,100
wheat or corn would be an example of

39
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:28,859
domesticating plants we also have

40
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,959
breeding for extreme variations compete

41
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,868
for very small pumpkins or I breed for

42
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,078
very large pumpkins we also have dog

43
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:39,390
sizes the Great Dane being a very large

44
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,978
dog and the Chihuahua being a very small

45
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,118
dog there's extremes of the variation

46
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:47,819
now within our evidence for the

47
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,310
selection theory of change natural

48
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,978
selection same process however there is

49
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,259
no human direction in this case we could

50
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,509
have ecological equivalents through an

51
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,618
analogous Anatomy so we're looking at

52
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,540
the fin of a shark penguin and of a

53
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,328
dolphin we have a fish a bird in a

54
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,060
mammal both developing these structures

55
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:12,750
to aid them in being able to swim within

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,800
the water environment also we have the

57
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,090
same process without human

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,969
selection looking at natural selection

59
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,400
with homologous Anatomy this is where

60
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,469
there's a common ancestor where if we

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,300
look at the human arm the cat the whale

62
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,590
in the bat well they may all perform at

63
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,250
very different functions

64
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,650
grabbing walking swimming flying they

65
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,500
all have the same basic structure or

66
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,010
Anatomy this again evidence for natural

67
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,629
selection theory of change within this

68
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,329
theory of change if drug and pesticide

69
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,009
resistance as becomes an issue if we

70
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,170
have a collection of bugs that are

71
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,569
eating a crop reading a plant we have

72
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:50,879
this first generation then a pesticide

73
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,219
application is applied and what reason

74
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,259
the red bugs have our natural resistance

75
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:58,080
to that particular chemical and a couple

76
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,120
other of the other color you're able to

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,219
survive just based on their location

78
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,750
maybe when the spray occurs the next

79
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:06,930
generation we see bugs have the same

80
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,090
number so in same chemicals applied well

81
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,099
now we have that selection process for

82
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,960
those red bugs being able to survive in

83
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:16,199
greater numbers meaning this chemical

84
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,330
spray it has these bugs have a

85
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:21,089
resistance to this pesticide of this

86
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,770
chemical application now Charles Darwin

87
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,219
came up with the idea of natural

88
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,170
selection here in 1831 Charles Darwin

89
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:31,620
took a role of natural sand ship HMS

90
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:33,238
Beagle and he sailed on a five-year

91
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,879
navigational trip around the world could

92
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,379
kind of see his track here we stayed a

93
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,180
wide variety of plants and animals

94
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:42,719
across the globe but of particular

95
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,610
importance he was known for his studies

96
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,229
he did in the Galapagos Islands and

97
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,489
they're located right here here's a

98
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,859
little image here of what they actually

99
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,830
look like different sizes in a small

100
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,730
cluster pretty far off any large

101
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,620
mainland

102
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:59,159
this allows some very unique things to

103
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,439
develop here now his observations

104
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,750
convinced him that evolution took place

105
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,329
fossils of extinct species resembled

106
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,229
living species in the same area the

107
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,969
Galapagos finches

108
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:10,889
differed slightly in their appearance

109
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:12,300
but resembled those in South American

110
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:14,429
mainland so even though they're

111
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,019
separated by quite the distance there's

112
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,930
some strong resemblance they may have

113
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,780
migrated or traveled from there in 1859

114
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,430
he publishes book the Origin of Species

115
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,049
and he proposed that evolution occurs

116
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,150
through the process of it

117
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:36,418
natural selection here's a copy of that

118
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:38,698
top book here so Charles Darwin he

119
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:41,668
observe ations that eventually convinced

120
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,500
him that evolution took place fossils

121
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:46,139
from extinct species resembled living

122
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,029
species in the same area an example of

123
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,250
this was his Galapagos finches that he

124
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:52,408
studied differed slightly in appearance

125
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,569
but resembled those in South American

126
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:57,360
mainland the kiddin that there may be

127
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,800
some connection there in 1859 he

128
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,259
published his book the Origin of Species

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,879
located right here where he proposed

130
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:07,319
that this evolution occurs for the

131
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:09,750
process of natural selection now even

132
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,968
though we may know it that is his most

133
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,339
quote famous work he was most proud of

134
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:16,139
his work that he did on earthworms he

135
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:19,168
was fascinated by their behavior he

136
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,090
conducted 40 years of earthworm

137
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:23,339
experiments that occurred both in the

138
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:24,689
lab and in the field so when you

139
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,939
struggle with a lab experiment just

140
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:29,129
think he spent 40 years just looking at

141
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,959
earthworms and amongst other things that

142
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,449
he studied he published his findings in

143
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,788
1881 in the book that we see pictured

144
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,590
here the book sold 6,000 copies in its

145
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:39,478
first year selling faster than the

146
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:41,698
Origin of Species when it was first

147
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,568
published if I an Amazon in hardcover

148
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:49,050
for $45 there's also some soft cover

149
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:50,520
options available for a reduced cost now

150
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,930
the theory of natural selection so he

151
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,728
came up with the idea about what is that

152
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,560
theory of natural selection well he

153
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,418
observed 14 different infinite species

154
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,120
they differed and mainly in the beaks

155
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,378
and feeding habits he concluded that the

156
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,810
results were descendants with

157
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:06,060
modifications from a common ancestor or

158
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,769
as we now term at evolution meaning

159
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,800
there was an original common ancestor

160
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:13,079
and that ate seeds for example those

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,509
that ate leaves at insects tool-using

162
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,908
and grubs and and buds or fruit had to

163
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,669
develop different beaks to be able to

164
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:23,250
best and match or fit the modifications

165
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:24,778
for their particular in the environment

166
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,579
that they were living in in this case

167
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:28,829
the food item that they were eating here

168
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,750
the insect eating bird is a very small

169
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:33,478
and pointed beak able to grab maybe

170
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,250
small insects those eating buds or large

171
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,569
fruit as developed a very strong beak to

172
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:41,100
maybe break shell of a nut for example

173
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:43,170
now the theory of natural selection we

174
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,270
kind of see evident here Darla's from

175
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,040
there with artificial selection used by

176
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:48,899
breeders to produce animals and plants

177
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,030
with particular traits if you're

178
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,549
familiar with maybe broccoli or kale or

179
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:56,699
even cabbage or cauliflower they all

180
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,710
kind of go back to wild mustard plant

181
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,779
through artificial selection through

182
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,819
breeding and selective breeding I should

183
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:05,129
say growers have been able to take the

184
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,980
wild mustard and produce kale broccoli

185
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:09,600
Brussels sprouts cabbage and cauliflower

186
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,100
with modifications to certain traits

187
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,350
whether it's the stem where the leaves

188
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,260
with a terminal bud or the flower buds

189
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,939
able to get all these different strains

190
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,560
that were maybe familiar with but they

191
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,920
all can be traced back to a common

192
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,810
ancestor dog breeding is another example

193
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,460
here dog Ridge shown enormous amount of

194
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,800
variability due to the target selection

195
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:31,529
of particular traits by man if wolf is

196
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,240
the common ancestor Europe America China

197
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:35,849
and India have all bred for different

198
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,620
subsets of that selection process but

199
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:41,220
they all can be traced back to the

200
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,660
common wolf ancestor the process of

201
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,430
natural selection

202
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,200
these trait selection can occur in

203
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,420
nature which he termed again that

204
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,860
natural selective process and it's

205
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,780
occurs in response to a number of

206
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,270
conditions there could be simple

207
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,579
variation in color within a population

208
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:58,620
that's inherited could be bright yellow

209
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,050
or dark brown there could be competition

210
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,149
over a production of offspring leads to

211
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,610
competition for survival who's a best

212
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,259
fit for their environment these leads to

213
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,270
adaptations for individuals with

214
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,519
beneficial adaptations or mildew to

215
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:12,659
survive and pass on their genes here we

216
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,089
see the brightly colored one easily

217
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,860
sticking out easily getting eaten versus

218
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:18,869
the ones that blend in or camouflage a

219
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,000
little bit better and this ultimately

220
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,040
leads to a selection process over many

221
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,920
generations there is a change in allele

222
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,340
frequency this is leading to the concept

223
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,159
of evolution now this theory of natural

224
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:36,029
selection here also applies to kind of

225
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,399
food so Darwin was influenced by Malta's

226
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:41,668
si the principle of population this is

227
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,319
back in 1798 where populations increased

228
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:46,049
exponentially while food supplies

229
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,180
increase only in kind of a linear scale

230
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:50,778
thus food supply will limit population

231
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:53,719
growth so here we have in

232
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:55,938
example our population growth in this

233
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,699
case our population is below the kind of

234
00:08:55,938 --> 00:09:01,578
food threshold so there's a food surplus

235
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:03,289
then over time if population grows will

236
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:04,278
be a food shortage and this will lead to

237
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,929
competition

238
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:09,679
and who's the best fit for the

239
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:12,708
environment lastly our four fundamentals

240
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,808
of natural selection proposed by Charles

241
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:17,419
Darwin and Alfred Wallace he proposed

242
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:19,850
that there are heritable traits to be

243
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:21,998
able to come in to be passed on limiting

244
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,009
factors exist in all environments

245
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:27,290
overpopulation of offspring lead to

246
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:29,870
those that best fit and reproduction by

247
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:32,509
those who are that best fit they're able

248
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,370
to fit that environment we kind of see

249
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,470
here our initial little frequency of all

250
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,019
the colors is equal but then there's a

251
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,778
selection for for whatever reason this

252
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:44,179
case the red circles and over time that

253
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:46,850
allele frequency of the red becomes much

254
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:49,519
greater and we see that the pink here is

255
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,209
basically selected against as does the

256
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,909
yellow adaptation of populations is the

257
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:58,479
result of this natural selection process

258
00:09:55,909 --> 00:10:00,649
so hopefully this kind of gives you some

259
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,600
appreciation for the natural selection

260
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:05,058
process and kind of what Darwin kind of

261
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:09,278
came up with and was able to theorize

262
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:09,278
based on his observations
