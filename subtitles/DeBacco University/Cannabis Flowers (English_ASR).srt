1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
so here we're going to take a detailed

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,120
look at the flowers that cannabis

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,820
produces as we know they produce female

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,620
flowers or male flowers but being able

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,259
to identify those at different stages is

6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:15,058
important early on a plant will produce

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,740
something called pre-flowers These are

8
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,778
the first way to visually determine if

9
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,939
the plant is male or if the plant is

10
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:22,739
female you want to look at the leaf node

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,719
for these pre-flowers which will

12
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,118
typically be seen after about a month or

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,439
so of vegetative growth pre-flowers are

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,660
typically found between the fourth and

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,880
sixth node as you count up from the base

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,939
of a plant it's not advised to induce

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,920
flowering until these pre-flowers appear

18
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:39,718
even though you can have a plant flower

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,280
at any time these pre-flowers are kind

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,620
of like your indication that the plants

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,539
are ready to kind of go into flour the

22
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:47,579
female pre-flower looks like this and

23
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,160
looking very down at the the node here

24
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,539
kind of see those white kind of

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,519
structures sticking out this white

26
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,140
stiglas coming out here's another

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,100
example of a female pre-flower with

28
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,320
their stem is a little bit more

29
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,079
developed these white kind of wispy

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,780
almost like whiskers

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,939
protruding here from the the plant node

32
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,379
here nail pre flowers look a little

33
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:09,118
different so this is the female this is

34
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:11,339
the male they don't have more that cup

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,719
shape they're going to be the pollen

36
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,740
producing structure and contain the

37
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,658
anthers

38
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,459
here's another example of a male prefler

39
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,740
a little bit more developed we kind of

40
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,199
see again that kind of larger cup shaped

41
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,539
appearance females indicative of that

42
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,420
kind of white stigma if you see here and

43
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,060
here males a little bit larger more bulb

44
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,920
type looking and those will ultimately

45
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,079
produce pollen and the females the

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,060
stigma the goal and the end would be to

47
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,158
capture the pollen there

48
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,200
now male flowers as I said they are

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,479
producing pollens we see here and this

50
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,399
can be a problem it's the pollen on

51
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,379
canvas is very fine it can travel long

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,540
distances in the air you can identify

53
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,060
them since they have a distinct pollen

54
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,340
sacs here here and this is one it's

55
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,259
clearly shedding some pollen these

56
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,000
plants are of little value low

57
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,519
cannabinoid content and should be

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,799
discarded to reduce unnecessary labor in

59
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,118
the potential for cross-pollination in

60
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,040
addition the pollen they produce

61
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,599
concrete not only a mess as we see here

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,520
on the leaves but could result in

63
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,959
unwanted pollination of neighboring

64
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,379
female flowers

65
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,840
male flowers reach maturity about one to

66
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,280
two weeks ahead of the female flowers so

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,259
this is great for identification because

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,239
you can usually identify them a little

69
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:23,280
bit earlier from the plant standpoint

70
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,020
this is advantageous because this way

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,659
pollen will be ready in the area when

72
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,239
the females is are receptive to it so

73
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,639
this is why male flowers are a little

74
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,200
bit earlier and this is allowing the

75
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,939
plant to ideally survive in the long

76
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,280
term because it'll always be pollen

77
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,019
available when those females are ready

78
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,060
the meal plan overall male plants

79
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,439
produce less total flour since each

80
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,000
flower can produce high amounts of

81
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,620
pollen even though if you look at this

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,459
fully developed male plant you can see

83
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,060
how much flowers are present on it the

84
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,519
reason why they only produce as much is

85
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,219
plants are producing a lot of pollen

86
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,658
grains per single flower so that's

87
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,800
what's allowing us to easily get caught

88
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:04,919
in the wind easily get caught in

89
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,239
circulation and passed around

90
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,458
the reason why we don't want to grow

91
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,099
plants necessarily to this full size and

92
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,539
Destroy them as early as possible as we

93
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,060
can identify them because if a female

94
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:17,039
flower gets fertilized the female plant

95
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,680
will transition more to seed formation

96
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,378
and not cannabinoid or CBD production

97
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,719
and that can really reduce the amount of

98
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:27,000
harvest someone's getting from a

99
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,400
chemical profile standpoint so then

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,259
going on to the female flowers their

101
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,939
distinguishing Factor are white fuzzy

102
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,098
stigmas we see here and definitely

103
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:36,598
evident in this image this structure may

104
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:39,298
take a little bit more time to develop

105
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:41,939
as a may be formed after a light green

106
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:45,959
seed racks at the node so these are kind

107
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:47,280
of apical buds here very easy to see but

108
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,158
initially if we're looking right at that

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,658
leaf node identification these may be a

110
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,639
little slower to develop definitely than

111
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:55,199
compared to the male flowers should

112
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,658
start looking for them around the fourth

113
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,399
to fifth branch of the internodes as you

114
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:01,560
work your way up the plant

115
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,299
um there's a way to try to determine the

116
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,819
gender of your plant whether it's female

117
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,920
or whether it's male and the early

118
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:10,318
determination will be great to allow you

119
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,780
to know early on whether you should be

120
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,818
keeping that plant investing Time and

121
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,379
Labor whether investing fertilizer on

122
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,019
that plant or if you should be

123
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:20,159
discarding it if it's a male because it

124
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,780
may produce pollen which could

125
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,780
contaminate your entire grow area
