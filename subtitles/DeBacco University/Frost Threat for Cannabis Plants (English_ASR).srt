1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,279
ever wondered how frost impacts cannabis

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,359
plants

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,318
well in this debaco university video

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,480
we're going to go over

5
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,800
some of the cold tolerance related to

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,679
cannabis as well as i'll take you

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,799
outside

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,278
to a field after a cold early fall

9
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,320
night to see how cannabis plants in this

10
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,800
various area

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:30,480
were impacted by the cold temperatures

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:32,320
that occurred over that night

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,000
all right let's go through the frost

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,280
threat for cannabis plants

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,439
well first off how does cold

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,359
temperatures impact the plant

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,960
this is a question it gets asked a lot

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,640
in general a true frost is when

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
temperatures get below 32 degrees

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
fahrenheit or zero degrees celsius

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,839
but temperatures approaching these

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,760
values can cause damage

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,360
cannabinoids are not directly impacted

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,198
but the plant is

25
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,799
so cold temperatures can stunt the plant

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,920
and cause stresses which can limit

27
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,919
production so keep that in mind so are

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,800
you having a cold night are you having

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,840
cold nights with that s on the end one

30
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,359
cold night may

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,200
be enough to stunt the plant but

32
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,438
multiple nights of cold temperatures

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,118
not even below freezing was can cause

34
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,639
plants to completely shut down

35
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,478
this can be very hard to get the plants

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,359
to restart even if it gets warm for a

37
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,200
period of time

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,879
and we're not looking at the daytime

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,359
temperatures it's really those nighttime

40
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,399
temperatures 33 32 31 30 degrees

41
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,640
fahrenheit

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
this could be causing some issues there

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,960
for any outdoor cannabis

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,319
plants so sometimes this leads to what's

45
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,319
called a forest harvest

46
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,839
when cold temperatures set in this can

47
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,559
be a sign to the grower

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,920
that they need to harvest what they can

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,759
when they can

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
getting some harvest is better than

51
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,640
getting no harvest

52
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,078
because if we're going to lose the

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,118
plants too cold even though the plants

54
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,798
may not be 100

55
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,319
ready well it doesn't look good going

56
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,000
into the future so

57
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,398
take what you can get when you can get

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,759
it now let's go outside

59
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,439
take a look at some plants that

60
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,879
experienced a pretty chilly night

61
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:01,039
and see how they reacted so people will

62
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,280
often ask is cannabis frost tolerant

63
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,560
and some people will say yes some people

64
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,359
will say no

65
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,118
and while it may be frost tolerant it's

66
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,120
not very frost talent we see that

67
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,680
perfect example here where this

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,520
area outdoors did get hit with a frost

69
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
and we're seeing this cannabis plant the

70
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,719
effects

71
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,520
from that frost so did it kill the plant

72
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,199
no

73
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,520
but if we look very closely we because

74
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,958
it did induce a lot of stress we're

75
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,879
seeing a lot of coloration

76
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,000
changes kind of we're not getting that

77
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,239
growth anymore

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
we kind of really stop stunted a lot of

79
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,640
the growth factor stunted a lot of the

80
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,800
plant

81
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,839
so while it didn't kill it it definitely

82
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
set it back and it's

83
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,840
kind of damaged that structure in the

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,598
sense that if possible you want to do

85
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,280
your best to avoid frost

86
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,878
on your cannabis plants or if you get a

87
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
frost soon after

88
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,759
try to get through and harvest them

89
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,479
because you're not going to get much

90
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,399
after

91
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,000
and it's only going to cause a chance

92
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,080
that other bad things could happen

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,439
you could lose the entire plant so

94
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,840
here's an area that got hit with some

95
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,519
recent frost this is an outdoor grow as

96
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,598
you can obviously tell and you're

97
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,120
noticing plants respond in different

98
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,199
ways to the frost

99
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
some get definitely this more yellow

100
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,119
coloration to the leaves

101
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,519
some get more of that purple coloration

102
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
as anthocyanins to develop

103
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,640
but overall if you just look down this

104
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,480
little row here

105
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,238
we can see that no matter how the plants

106
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,238
respond to the frost

107
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,519
either way was not very good it's not

108
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,560
going to boast well

109
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,439
for future improvement on harvest

110
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,120
so cannabis plants definitely can

111
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,318
tolerate some frost

112
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
but not really something you want to

113
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,158
expose them to as we can see here

114
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,439
where at least these cultivars

115
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,359
definitely have

116
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,799
kind of reached their peak and should be

117
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,239
harvested soon

118
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,319
now that we're not going to get too much

119
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,920
more progression on their growth

120
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,598
there's only a chance that other

121
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,798
negative factors could occur

122
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,798
more frost other damage so it'd be best

123
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
to get these out of the field

124
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,599
now here we're talking about frost

125
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,959
damage and how that affects plants

126
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:55,759
differently this is another plant

127
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,120
outside

128
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,798
a little closer to a tree line as you

129
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,319
can see right behind me so not

130
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,438
necessarily hit quite as hard with the

131
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,039
frost as some

132
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,878
others maybe that are in fully exposed

133
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,120
areas but we can still see

134
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,639
definitely a little bit of a stress

135
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
there a little bit of a hit to the

136
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,000
overall

137
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,799
kind of plant performance there not what

138
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
it could have been

139
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,160
but this was a little further along so

140
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,399
hopefully

141
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,400
not as great a percentage reduction but

142
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,358
still not reaching the maximum that

143
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,198
could have been

144
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,879
that's just a factor of growing outside

145
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,360
some of the challenges associated with

146
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,040
that

147
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
where you don't have control over all

148
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,400
these different conditions

149
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,918
now the advantage is we have a lot less

150
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,120
up front cost so you kind of got to

151
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,959
balance that out

152
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,478
as far as maybe not getting the maximum

153
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,120
amount of yield here being grown

154
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,639
outside but also not having the all the

155
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
inputs necessarily

156
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,478
that would be associated with an indoor

157
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,479
grow
