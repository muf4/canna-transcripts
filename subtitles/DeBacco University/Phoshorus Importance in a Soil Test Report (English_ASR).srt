1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,639
in this debaco university video we'll be

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,278
looking at phosphorus importance to

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,289
plants

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:15,679
in relation to a soil test report

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:17,039
[Music]

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,719
so while these tests typically are not

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
known for giving super accurate results

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,079
they can provide some indication

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,839
and really here you'll be getting your

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,198
test at a professional lab

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,599
and we're going to look at phosphorus

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,000
importance in a soil test report you get

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,960
from

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,678
professional lab so first off the impact

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,359
of phosphorus

16
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:38,320
on plants phosphorus or chemical or

17
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,320
elemental symbol p is essential for root

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,200
development in the production of flowers

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,799
and fruits

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,559
so as a result does get a lot of

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,320
attention from growers

22
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,759
you can see here's a couple of the

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
things that are related to phosphorus

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,039
but root formation

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,079
promotion of flowers and fruits are

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,960
typical roles

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,600
associated with phosphorus however

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
phosphorus

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,039
is being regulated in more and more

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,119
states

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,520
native connecticut soils and this is

32
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,280
using connecticut as an example

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,640
and native connected soils are generally

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,478
low in phosphorus

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,760
and much of what is present is bound in

36
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,599
both organic matter

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
and inorganic forms not readily

38
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,158
available to plants

39
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,879
however over-application has led to a

40
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,799
2013 law

41
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,239
regulating the use of phosphorus on

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
established lawns

43
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,319
phosphorus is a serious pollutant of

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,400
inland waterways leading to algal blooms

45
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,519
and accompanying environmental and human

46
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
health risks

47
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,759
and this has gotten to the point that

48
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,640
new legislation or legislation has been

49
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,280
enacted

50
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,079
to regulate the use of phosphorus in

51
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
soils

52
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,399
so realize that this is a could be a

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,438
very serious concern

54
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,359
so when we're looking at those

55
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,559
phosphorus levels phosphorus is most

56
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,840
available in soil

57
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,759
ph around 6.5 and during moist warm

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,118
conditions soil tests provide an

59
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,118
estimate of the amount of readily

60
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,640
available phosphorus and recommendations

61
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,799
are made accordingly

62
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,478
the goal here is if it's very acidic

63
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,520
very alkaline a lot of that phosphorus

64
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,078
is locked up

65
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,200
that ph just right we have a lot of the

66
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,798
phosphorus being

67
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,520
plant available now what impacts the

68
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,200
plant availability of this phosphorus

69
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,480
and there's kind of a combination of

70
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,560
factors

71
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,159
that do impact its availability as i

72
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,640
mentioned before of course ph

73
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,520
is one of them but we're also looking at

74
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,799
organic matter

75
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
mineralization of organic matter

76
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
releases plant available forms of

77
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,560
phosphorus into soils

78
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,680
organic molecules can also reduce

79
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,159
phosphorus retention

80
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,080
increasing the amount of available forms

81
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,639
clay content in soils

82
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,879
soils with higher clay content have high

83
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,559
phosphorus retention capacities

84
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,959
simply because clay particles have a

85
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,598
very large surface air per unit volume

86
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,759
which can absorb phosphorus very easily

87
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,679
the mineralogy of the soil

88
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,079
mineral composition of soil influences

89
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,080
the phosphorus absorption capacity

90
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,400
example soils with high content of

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,040
aluminum or iron ions

92
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
iron ions tend to have the greatest

93
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,840
phosphorus absorption capacity

94
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,800
which will decrease its availability to

95
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,360
plants

96
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
as i mentioned before soil ph optimum ph

97
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800
is between 6 and 7

98
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
results in the maximum phosphorus

99
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,159
availability

100
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,518
low ph acidic soils have great amounts

101
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,799
of aluminum iron

102
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,439
which form strong bonds with the

103
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,400
phosphate high ph soils when calcium is

104
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,039
dominant cation

105
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,879
phosphate tends to partici precipitate

106
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,560
with those calcium ions

107
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,959
and there's also other factors such as

108
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,519
temperature moisture and soil aeration

109
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,479
can also affect the rate of phosphorus

110
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,439
mineralization

111
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,479
from organic matter and decomposition so

112
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,359
in humid

113
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,439
warm conditions climates organic matter

114
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
decomposes faster compared to cool

115
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,039
dry climates and there's also erosion

116
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,199
and potential runoff

117
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,919
that can also occur that and to increase

118
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:51,439
availability we can also have weathering

119
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,438
dissolution and disabsorption as well

120
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,719
so how do we control how much phosphorus

121
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,039
you add

122
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,878
well an additional phosphorus beyond the

123
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,280
agronomic need of crops has

124
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,959
minimal effect on crop yield so why

125
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,640
would you be adding more

126
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,640
however the excess phosphorus is

127
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,719
susceptible to loss through runoff

128
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,079
and erosion it can promote algal growth

129
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,080
in freshwater systems

130
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,360
causing degradation of water quality

131
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
this is why it's important to know what

132
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,479
your phosphorus levels are

133
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,439
and in some cases where you've got the

134
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,199
optimum level or probably above optimum

135
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,759
you can purchase fertilizers that do not

136
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,120
have any fertilizer in them a 2404 is

137
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,319
the example here

138
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
because you already know you've got

139
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,599
enough phosphorus in your soil so no

140
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,680
need to add any more

141
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,759
and this would offer you the other

142
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,478
nutrients that you your crops may need

143
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,600
without running the risk of contributing

144
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,758
to fresh water

145
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,639
contamination through algal blooms and

146
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,840
general runoff

147
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,840
of excess phosphorus
