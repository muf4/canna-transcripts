1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:08,318
going to go an in-depth

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,319
look at comparing types of fertilizer

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:16,160
[Music]

5
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:19,519
let's get into comparing types of

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,519
fertilizer options uh for growing plants

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,920
so first off we with fertilizer we have

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,518
what's called a guaranteed analysis

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,039
and all fertilizer labels have three

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,038
distinctive numbers displayed

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,279
which is the guaranteed analysis these

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,120
numbers represent the primary nutrients

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,280
and are presented in this consistent

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,119
order here we see nitrogen

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,879
followed by phosphorus followed by

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,558
potassium and in this case this

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,238
fertilizer has no phosphorus

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,159
but is still listed as a number in this

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,000
case zero this allows

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,558
nutrient ratios to be compared of any

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,159
fertilizer specifically the forms of

22
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,959
each that the plant can uptake

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,319
can be listed as well first number is

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,480
the amount of nitrogen

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,640
second number is the amount of phosphate

26
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,398
in the form of p2o5

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,039
and to get the actual amount of

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,478
phosphorous uh you take the p205 and

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,920
multiple it by 0.044 to get the p

30
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,679
and the third number is potash k2o

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,118
to get the actual number of just

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,360
potassium to k2 and multiply it by 0.83

33
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,879
however because growers are typically

34
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,478
looking at what's plant available

35
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,560
this is why they're presented in these

36
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,840
forms you'll also notice the guaranteed

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,640
analysis down here

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,880
lists water soluble nitrogen with water

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,280
in

40
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,959
soluble nitrogen and that four percent

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,599
of water insoluble nitrogen

42
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,559
is slowly available nitrogen is derived

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,199
in this example

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,079
from biosolids so what if there's a

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,439
fourth number

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,279
what if you kind of see the three

47
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,798
numbers and then there's a fourth number

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
well the fourth number may appear in

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,640
some specialty fertilizers

50
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,438
this will usually represent either iron

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
or sulfur

52
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,158
so be sure to check the label in this

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,118
case we're looking at kind of this

54
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,520
multi-nutrient blend here

55
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,159
these nutrients are supplemental and may

56
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,239
be a value

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,680
under special conditions and this is why

58
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,319
there's typically only those three

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
numbers

60
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,118
kind of listed there those specialty

61
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,280
fertilizers now we're looking at

62
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,719
fertilizers can contain only one of

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,560
three primary nutrients

64
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,159
in this example we have nitrogen sources

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,800
such as ammonium nitrate

66
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,400
which is 35.5 nitrogen with no

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,000
phosphorous or potassium

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
urea sodium nitrate or liquid nitrogen

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,639
as well

70
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
all these are very fit much favoring the

71
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,679
nitrogen

72
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,959
with no phosphorus or potassium which in

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
certain cases might be

74
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,360
beneficial then there's a phosphorus

75
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,840
source typically super triple phos 046

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,599
zero a very potent source of phosphorus

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,280
and then potash or potassium sources

78
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,560
here potassium chlorine potassium

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,840
sulfate 60

80
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,280
and 50 um potassium respectively

81
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
i think it isn't blending fertilizers

82
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,080
it's jax professional

83
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,280
a 20 20 20 and even blend of nitrogen

84
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,920
phosphorus and potassium so we get into

85
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
those water soluble and insoluble forms

86
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,639
uh here

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,599
so labels will often state how much of

88
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,518
the nitrogen is either water insoluble

89
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,280
which is slowly released over a long

90
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
period of time typically several weeks

91
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,439
months months or even potentially years

92
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,280
as opposed to quickly available water

93
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,199
soluble nitrogen we see that listed

94
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,199
right here typically fertilizers will

95
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,639
contain a combination of both forms

96
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,919
because if it all contained one

97
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,759
either will be waiting a really long

98
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,919
time or it'll be available

99
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,318
in a very short period of time quickly

100
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,399
available water soluble forms

101
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,158
allows for quick results only days about

102
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,719
three days after application you can see

103
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,719
a

104
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,639
change in the plants word of caution

105
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,080
with the water cybel forms as these have

106
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,359
higher odds of plant damage

107
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,599
if applied too concentrated in addition

108
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,599
the slower released forms often have a

109
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,280
coating or other mechanisms to allow

110
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,959
that slow release to occur

111
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,799
so often these forms have an additional

112
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,319
expense associated with them

113
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
and again here's just another example of

114
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:48,399
a label we're focusing on nitrogen of

115
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,920
course

116
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,680
but we see there's other nutrients as

117
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,479
well in this case there's also

118
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,200
other non-plant food ingredients

119
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,759
included

120
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,438
as well as some of the bacteria so again

121
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,399
there's a lot that can be

122
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,239
gleaned for information from the label

123
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,438
now this fertilizer ratio

124
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,680
again things are still in the same

125
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,280
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium form

126
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,879
the ratio fertilizers is the

127
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,080
relationship between nitrogen phosphorus

128
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,719
potassium content

129
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,239
in those fertilizers the ratio basics

130
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,279
the fertilizer with a three one two

131
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,518
ratio contains

132
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,879
more than half the times as much

133
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,439
nitrogen as it does

134
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,000
potassium and three times more nitrogen

135
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,360
than

136
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
phosphorus it kind of gives you that

137
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,280
ratio there fertilizer example for

138
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,479
lesser grades of 45 15

139
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,918
30 have a 3 to 1 to 2 ratio these are

140
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,918
important potentially for different

141
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,319
stages of growth the nutrient

142
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,719
concentrations are pound for pound a 36

143
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,599
12 24 fertilizer contains twice as much

144
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,000
nutrients

145
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,240
as a six as an eight six twelve

146
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,680
fertilizer so keep that in mind as well

147
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,439
when you're looking at your application

148
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,280
rates here we see some grades and some

149
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,360
ratios as some examples

150
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,879
and nitrogen is typically kind of meant

151
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,879
to be for greening up the plant again

152
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,040
these are just general examples

153
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,879
phosphorus we think kind of down in the

154
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,400
sense of the roots and blooms

155
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,399
and potassium products kind of all

156
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,638
around so it's the up down all around

157
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,279
nitrogen phosphorus potassium kind of

158
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,720
lingo there just to get you an idea of

159
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:16,079
what generally each can do now how much

160
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,400
is in the bag of fertilizer so

161
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,839
the fertilizer ratios does not usually

162
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,519
reflect the elemental nitrogen

163
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,319
phosphorus and potassium as i mentioned

164
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,959
before

165
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,079
only in nitrogen is expressed as the

166
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,319
elemental basis p

167
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,680
and k are expresses the oxidized basic

168
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,639
compounds because those are the plant

169
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,319
available ones

170
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,000
this means that a fertilizer that reads

171
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,759
eight eighteen

172
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,918
six twelve as we see right here eighteen

173
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,319
six twelve this contains 18

174
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,918
nitrogen 6 phosphorus and 12

175
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,680
potassium as far as plant available

176
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,839
concerns so if you purchase

177
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
a hundred pound bag of this it would be

178
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,359
18 pounds nitrogen six pounds

179
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,039
and 12 pounds respectively if you

180
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,680
purchase a 20 pound bag

181
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,159
that would have 3.6 pounds nitrogen 1.2

182
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,879
pounds

183
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,400
phosphorus 2.4 potassium so you can see

184
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,600
how those ratios play

185
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,079
and that's going to be important when

186
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,080
you look at your application rates

187
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,240
so looking at solid fertilizer we see

188
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,478
here a granular form if you will

189
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,319
uh it's known for good handling

190
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,439
properties and allow even distribution

191
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,240
because it's like little pebbles or

192
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,959
rocks

193
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,439
this form does not cake or form fine

194
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,318
dust

195
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,959
which can make applications challenging

196
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
so

197
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,239
this is a typically easier form to apply

198
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,839
blended fertilizers we see down here as

199
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
a result of a combination of single

200
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,839
element or compound fertilizers

201
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,520
to achieve a certain ratio or blend

202
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,399
that's created to match the results of a

203
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,758
soil test

204
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,239
some fertilizer companies will make a

205
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,400
blend if you give them soil test results

206
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,918
however this can cause there to be a

207
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,279
size and color differences between the

208
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,120
different types of fertilizer

209
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,038
which can sometimes lead to uneven

210
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,720
applications if one particle is really

211
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,959
big and one particle's really small

212
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,960
that can lead to uneven applications

213
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,638
this fertilizer does help ensure that

214
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,079
resulting field is fertilized with

215
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,400
nutrients that's needed

216
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,120
in the ratios based on the soil test and

217
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,120
reduces

218
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,879
the potential for over-application of

219
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,720
one nutrient so it's better than just

220
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,120
applying one single nutrient even in the

221
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,120
custom blend all the better

222
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,478
there's also liquid fertilizers and

223
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,000
there's clear solutions

224
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,758
which have nutrients that are completely

225
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,918
dissolved in water to make handling

226
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,960
very easy for the applicator however

227
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,560
these are

228
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,560
only available in relatively low

229
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,720
concentrated nutrients

230
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,598
then there is suspension fertilizers

231
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,199
these are

232
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,639
basically nutrient suspensions in

233
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,520
solution and have higher nutrient

234
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
concentrations

235
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,758
and can be used as a regular fluid

236
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,360
however these types of flies require

237
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,598
repeated applications

238
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,800
both while in storage and even during

239
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,759
applications they need kind of that

240
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,919
agitation

241
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,879
so they don't usually settle at the

242
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,359
bottom because you want to ensure you're

243
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,240
getting an

244
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,680
even application of your fertilizer then

245
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,319
there's also gaseous forms

246
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,319
of fertilizer used only in limited

247
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,080
applications due to special handling and

248
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
safety precautions that are needed

249
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,279
anhydrous ammonia is a great nitrogen

250
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,799
fertilizer

251
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,359
and is a common gaseous form of

252
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,598
fertilizer however to be effective it

253
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,240
must be injected into the soil

254
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,240
so and hopefully that soil has limited

255
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,079
rocks to prevent the gas from escaping

256
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,280
so when you put that injecting that

257
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,878
nitrogen

258
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,239
down below the soil surface well there's

259
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
a lot of rocks those tips are basically

260
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,280
going to get

261
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,039
broken this is why you can only apply an

262
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,119
area with limited rocks

263
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,439
because it wants to be covered up and

264
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,720
sealed so it's kept in the root zone

265
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,879
hazards involve the handling of an

266
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,319
hydrogen include the kind of serious

267
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,240
credential for chemical burns and

268
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,919
affixiation as well

269
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,280
so again be cautious with this type of

270
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:32,718
fertilizer

271
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,799
then there's organic material

272
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,399
considerations so often these have

273
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,120
variable properties so each must be

274
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,278
evaluated

275
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,560
independently key properties to consider

276
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,360
with any fertilizer particularly

277
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,278
organics

278
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,879
is solubility meaning how well do the

279
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,958
nutrients dissolve in water

280
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,879
fish fertilizer for example can take a

281
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,399
kind of hard or very low solubility can

282
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,838
be hard to get into solution

283
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,919
then there's a particle size this can

284
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,279
relate to simply the application method

285
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,719
but also the speed of a bill

286
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,120
availability to the plant

287
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,560
with smaller particles being quicker to

288
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
become plant available compared to

289
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,119
larger particles sometimes you pay more

290
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,959
for that finer

291
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,360
grounding but it will be more plant

292
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,599
available faster

293
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,879
then we want to consider also soluble

294
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,839
salts and this is

295
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,320
pertains to organic as well as inorganic

296
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,959
forms

297
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,560
of fertilizer high salts can cause

298
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,359
damage to plants but if fertilizer

299
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,000
applications

300
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,759
are evenly distributed and amounts

301
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,159
follow the guidance of a soil test

302
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,080
the odds are low of plant damage however

303
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,199
concentrated applications placed near

304
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,040
germinating seeds

305
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,080
can increase the odds of damage

306
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,519
especially if applied in a band or line

307
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,360
so here we see example of the seeds

308
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,959
being planted here and here we're

309
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,000
banding that fertilizer we're putting it

310
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,518
about five and a half

311
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,278
inches away from the plants seeds 11

312
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,959
inches is our row spacing

313
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,958
so those roots can kind of grow out to

314
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,559
that fertilizer this can happen with

315
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,838
organic fertilizers such as manure in

316
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,879
particular

317
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,880
some people will broadcast their

318
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,080
fertilizers some will subsoil ban

319
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,838
meaning they put the seed here and they

320
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,000
put the banana fertilizer below

321
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,760
others will go kind of put the seed here

322
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
and put the fertilizer over on this side

323
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,039
so those roots will grow out

324
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,039
and when they're more developed and

325
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,360
ready to uptake those nutrients this is

326
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,199
called

327
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,639
banding fertilizer typically with

328
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
soluble salts if you put it right next

329
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,439
to the seed it's going to burn that seed

330
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,159
or that tender root

331
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,279
when it initially germinates so when

332
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,039
we're looking at that salt we want to

333
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,480
look at the consider the salt index so

334
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,838
you want to know the salt in the index

335
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,560
of the fertilizer you're intending on

336
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,240
using

337
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,559
you could see some have very low salt

338
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,759
index some a very high salt index it

339
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,119
doesn't mean that you just stay away

340
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,958
from the ones that have high salt

341
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,639
just be aware because that's going to

342
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,599
maybe affect how you

343
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:38,240
apply it or how much you will apply it

344
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,560
to limit the chance of plant damage

345
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,519
lastly we have fertilizer grades here

346
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,879
and this is when we're looking at

347
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,799
purchasing fertilizer

348
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,240
manufacturers produce different grades

349
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,479
of mini-fertilizing

350
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,399
for plants we have the granular which is

351
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,000
often the largest for field applications

352
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,000
due to typically the lowest

353
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,919
cost due to the particle size will be

354
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,078
the largest and technically the most

355
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,159
variable generally it's about 22

356
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,919
millimeters just to give you an idea

357
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,199
then we have the mini granular which is

358
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,799
highly uniform

359
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,800
medium-sized particles about 14

360
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,639
millimeters green's grade

361
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,159
is micro-sized particles commonly used

362
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,759
in greens and golf courses

363
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,278
very finely ground about nine

364
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,399
millimeters in particle size very

365
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:15,838
consistent

366
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
typically you're going to pay the most

367
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,600
for the greens grade even though it

368
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,600
might be the exact same fertilizer that

369
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
you can get in the granular form

370
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
and also soluble quickly dissolves in

371
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,120
liquid fertilizer solution

372
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,320
basically it's like a wettable powder so

373
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,000
you can then mix and go through and

374
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,519
rapidly apply and be very quickly

375
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,039
available to the plants

376
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,959
so while these might be of the same

377
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,039
fertilizer the different grade of

378
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,958
fertilizer can impact the cost

379
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,480
the method of application and the

380
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,919
availability to the plant

381
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
so hopefully you enjoyed this kind of

382
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,039
very detailed look at fertilizer options

383
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,720
so you'd be well educated and make an

384
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,958
informed decision

385
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,959
to the benefit of you and your plants
