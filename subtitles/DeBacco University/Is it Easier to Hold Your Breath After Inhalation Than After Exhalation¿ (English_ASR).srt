1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,609
okay here we're answering the question

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:10,440
is it easier to hold your breath after

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:12,269
inhalation or after exhalation and then

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,160
hold your breath so which one of those

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,830
is it easier to hold you breath for a

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,600
longer period of time

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,399
well actually it's easier to hold your

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,949
breath after inhalation and after

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,229
exhalation so why is that if you've ever

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,420
tried this you can try it yourself try

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,000
it in playing and all your breath and

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,260
exhale all your breath what's important

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,179
there the science behind this is that

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,399
your bodies cannot detect a little

15
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,920
oxygen but are sensitive actually to

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,539
high carbon dioxide your brain actually

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,090
uses blood carbon dioxide as an

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,789
indicator for blood oxygen so that when

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,739
your co2 levels are too high your signal

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,719
to take a breath so your body is only

21
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,479
looking at the carbon dioxide levels

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,840
speaking the assumption if carbon exit

23
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:56,369
is high then oxygen must be low now if

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,629
you find this heart believes that low

25
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:00,149
oxygen is not what makes you breathe

26
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:02,849
this is clearly a proof of concept and

27
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,170
that's carbon monoxide poisoning what's

28
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,060
happening during carbon monoxide

29
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,719
poisoning is all these negative factors

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,100
can also be death sadly or coma reason

31
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,890
why this happens is because you're

32
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,390
breathing air with low oxygen the co2

33
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,340
levels are actually the same in your

34
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,259
body that's what's regulating your

35
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,719
breathing so your breathing is actually

36
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,950
as normal even though because your co2

37
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:24,900
levels are normal

38
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,180
even though your oxygen levels are

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,250
becoming dangerously low you basically

40
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,740
die without ever realizing it because

41
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,759
your oxygen deprived so it's not because

42
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,109
of little oxygen you start breathing

43
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,819
more or start feeling shortness of

44
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,349
breath no your oxygen levels are

45
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,078
decreasing in carbon monoxide poisoning

46
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:42,059
but because your carbon dioxide levels

47
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,519
remaining normal your body basically

48
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,868
doesn't react as a result that low

49
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,450
oxygen they'll basically black out

50
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:50,430
without any warning the science behind

51
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,868
the question here is lungs full of a

52
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,240
breath of air have high oxygen

53
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:56,790
concentration and low carbon dioxide

54
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,679
concentration then your body does so

55
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,000
oxygen flows into your blood and carbon

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,570
acid out of your blood even though

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,438
you're holding your breath then after a

58
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,809
period of time

59
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,429
empty lungs have lower volume so fewer

60
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,860
carbon dioxide molecules are needed to

61
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,628
get the same concentration in your blood

62
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,260
reverses the process of diffusion thus

63
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:14,908
covering

64
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,128
they stops leaving your blood faster if

65
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:18,239
the lumps are empty meaning carbon

66
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:21,870
dioxide levels in your blood reach

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,759
critical levels faster and you need to

68
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,289
breathe sooner looking this in a

69
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,828
graphical standpoint is looking at

70
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,179
divers

71
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,610
here's normal breathing there's no

72
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,640
breathing virgin need to breathe occurs

73
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,010
when high carbon dioxide levels trigger

74
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,399
breathing has nothing to do with your

75
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:40,348
body perceiving oxygen levels also

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,658
notice our pH can influence the

77
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:45,238
hemoglobin binding portion there keep in

78
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:47,429
mind hemoglobin is a protein and as a

79
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,030
result pH can influence its shape and

80
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,469
its ability to bind oxygen lastly here

81
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,150
respiratory adjustments at high

82
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,818
altitudes if you've ever been to high

83
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,129
altitude there's basically air is not

84
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:01,018
quite as dense your body responds to

85
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:03,509
quick movement to high altitude which is

86
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,849
considered to be above 8,000 feet with

87
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:07,138
symptoms of acute mountain sickness it

88
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:10,518
is headache shortness of breath nausea

89
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:13,069
dizziness all negative things become an

90
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,420
alchemist committed to this area

91
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:17,578
respiratory and human trophic

92
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,979
adjustments include increasing

93
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,949
ventilation can actually breathe more

94
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:25,828
are more exchange more air supposedly

95
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:28,049
also you become more responsive to

96
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,090
carbon dioxide pressure and a

97
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,969
substantial decline in current and

98
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,009
oxygen pressure stimulates this

99
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:36,539
peripheral chemoreceptors so it's

100
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:39,509
important if you're going up to high

101
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:42,598
altitudes to adjust to this to basically

102
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:45,328
get yourself a climate 'add to this you

103
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:47,009
want to not go from sea level to 14,000

104
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,319
feet in one day when it worked your way

105
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,509
up to that typically it's suggested that

106
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:54,298
you start from that you're used to being

107
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:56,479
at sea level go up to 5,000 feet then go

108
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,719
above 8,000 feet and worked way up to

109
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,408
14,000 feet here at Pikes Peak now

110
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:03,090
body's going to do some of these

111
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,530
adjustments it's going to breathe a

112
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,598
little heavier you're going to drink a

113
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,400
lot of water these are all ways you can

114
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,348
try to negate some of this mountain

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,969
sickness that does occur and simply

116
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:14,848
occurring with your body's reacting day

117
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:16,769
simply having less air density at a high

118
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:19,048
altitude that what's typically used to

119
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,269
at low altitude you see this a lot

120
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,519
sports teams and events that go to

121
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,069
potentially Denver Mile High Stadium or

122
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,180
in Mexico or areas are very high in

123
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,099
elevation they

124
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,900
oh they're up to a week before so they

125
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,729
can get adjusted their body's adjusted

126
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:34,728
to that lower amount of air density
