1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
so here I would talk a little about

2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:06,028
fluorescent lights while there's many

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,400
different types t5 high output

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:10,769
fluorescents are typically kind of the

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,888
standard here a nice thin bulbs that

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,589
produce a nice high output in great if

7
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:20,100
you're looking getting clones going or

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:22,230
starting seedlings so the best suited as

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,090
I said for clones or seedlings they're

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,368
soft light that's not as intense as

11
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,379
other options that you may have should

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,018
be kept close to the plants one or two

13
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:33,469
inches away or if using t5 potentially

14
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,850
for maybe no more than six inches away

15
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:37,859
does that have a lot of excessive heat

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,020
produced so that's another advantage to

17
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,058
using fluorescent tubes here t fives are

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,859
the most efficient for an option but

19
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,128
tend to be more costly than some other

20
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:49,558
fluorescent tubes a light temperature so

21
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:52,140
you might hear them expressed in degrees

22
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,299
Kelvin 2800 is considered a warm white

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,920
flowering cool light or somewhat is

24
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,078
about 6500 K you can kind of

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,300
appreciation for a little bit of the

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,500
variance that they do produce however

27
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:03,358
since these are not good flowering

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,700
lights due to the lack of power produced

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,159
stick with the vegetative spectrums if

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,409
you select this type of light get an

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,090
upgrade for flowering so you want to

32
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,359
stay away from the warm whites and you

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,189
want to stick one of those cool whites

34
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:20,579
so ice and tubes typically 15 to 45

35
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,769
watts and 18 to 48 inches long shop work

36
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,390
lights can work but they're not the best

37
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,640
option because they have a poor plant

38
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,500
inspector on that poor car reading t5

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,629
bulbs can be placed higher above the

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,200
plants it's about 4 to 6 inches because

41
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:35,250
of their increased in brightness

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,109
fluorescents are well-suited for

43
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,078
shelving or vertical farming options

44
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,129
that we see here with lettuce production

45
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:42,509
reflectors are still important because

46
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:44,759
you want the light emitting everywhere

47
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,340
you want to kind of concentrate it in

48
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,549
focus directly below onto the plant

49
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,009
canopy so ice instead of a ballast are

50
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,409
required especially 45 lights do the

51
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,810
quality of light production and use of

52
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,250
cool running electronic ballasts also

53
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,140
reduces the chance of that kind of

54
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,019
flickering that you may get with some

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,700
lower quality bulbs keep in mind though

56
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,228
that these bulbs do contain mercury and

57
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,239
other toxic metals and need to be

58
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:12,719
disposed of properly so just simply

59
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,920
throw them away the bulb life so when

60
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,990
you do get to that kind of

61
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,449
a bowl even though bowls may not burned

62
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,459
out there is still a usable life to them

63
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:22,139
they may need to be changed out even if

64
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,780
they're not considered to be dead as we

65
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,969
see here a little ice it's a pretty long

66
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,818
about 20,000 hours which is about two

67
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:31,770
years if they're running 24 hours a day

68
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:34,649
it's recommended that you do replace

69
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,689
these bulbs after about 15 months but in

70
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,430
actuality replacing them every 10 to 12

71
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,310
months when using 18 hour days is

72
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,170
preferred just to get that maximum out

73
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,289
to slow your plants so they're not

74
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:47,818
stretching or getting late stressed

75
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:50,250
flesh and tube manufacturer comparison

76
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:51,869
grower house did an excellent comparison

77
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,849
I provided you with the link here and

78
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,700
link at the bottom here the PDF if they

79
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,560
have even the exact same bulbs different

80
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,030
manufacturers have very specific Allison

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,340
reflectors and this can make a

82
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,379
difference see the links below and you

83
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,620
can kind of compare while they are the

84
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,629
same exact you know general fluorescent

85
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,129
I mean might stink you're comparing

86
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,199
apples to oranges here and the

87
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,879
difference is that they do get and some

88
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,579
pictures showing the importance of the

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,489
manufacturers ballast and reflectors

90
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,000
that they choose to use and sell with

91
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:23,000
their bulbs
