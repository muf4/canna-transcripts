1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,400
on this debaco university video we'll go

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,359
over how to properly flush

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,359
cannabis plants

4
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:15,279
[Music]

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,640
ever wondered how to properly flush a

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:17,919
cannabis plant we're going to go over

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
some of the specifics

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,600
here in this video so first off

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,719
this information was provided here by

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
this thesis

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,759
so you're welcome to take a look at it

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,559
here this doctoral

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,559
dissertation if you will so great

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,479
information provided in there

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,199
only a brief summary of that will be

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,439
provided here on this video lecture

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,120
so first off flushing in general so

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,960
typically at the end of the flowering

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,000
cycle prior to harvest the root zone of

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,920
cannabis plants will be

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,480
watered with plain water that does not

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,640
contain any additives such as fertilizer

23
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,558
fertigated water is water that contains

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,239
nutrients so given minus these

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,000
regular water with no nutrients added

26
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,078
depending on the substrate the plant is

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,159
being grown in will dictate the duration

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,319
of the flushing period how many days

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,679
how much water will be added and the

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,359
goal here is to kind of take those

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
nutrients that might be kind of all

32
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,400
bound up

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,200
in that area and adding a lot of water

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
can kind of

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,040
cause them to be flushed out or removed

36
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,679
from that root zone and that will

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
dilute that plant there and create more

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,000
of just

39
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,919
express the plant or allow the plant to

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,239
have more of its just natural

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,240
cannabinoids and profiles in there

42
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,359
without having the necessarily the

43
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,239
chance of having any of the nutrients

44
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,519
and fertilizers held in that final

45
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,519
product

46
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,719
so flushing specifics looking at in

47
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,399
relation to the study

48
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,000
flushing occurred over the last two

49
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,560
weeks of production when the nutrient

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,519
solution was replaced with clear water

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
during routine

52
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,359
irrigation events so a lot of growers

53
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,359
will add fertilizer to their water

54
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,599
well in this case water was still added

55
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,239
but no nutrients were added to that

56
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,000
water

57
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,839
another flushing method was applied to

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,599
an additional 10 liters of water without

59
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
any fertilizer to the plant

60
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,319
over two irrigation events at the start

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,000
of a two week period of clear water

62
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,919
irrigation and then clear water is just

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,438
again no fertilizer being added

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,159
that's what this study was looking at in

65
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,639
part so here are the specific treatments

66
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,840
we can see them all listed here control

67
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,719
treatment with 10 liters

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,039
initial flush completed twice of

69
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,639
non-fertigated water until harvest

70
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,560
then another control treatment was

71
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,878
without 10 liters of an initial flush

72
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,920
and non-brigade water until harvest so

73
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,560
one they did

74
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,559
add an extra irrigation event and then

75
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,120
continued with just plain water

76
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,000
here they did not use that additional

77
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
flushing

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,360
irrigation event there then they had two

79
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,840
mild stress treatments

80
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
they called with uh non-fertigated water

81
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,120
until harvest

82
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,800
and then one was with fertigated water

83
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,560
until harvest for a comparison

84
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,480
then the moderate stress ones were uh

85
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
treatments with non-frigate water until

86
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,399
harvest and then treat with fertigate

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,639
water

88
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,719
and to harvest there and the durations

89
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,318
that they went through and did this

90
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,639
were kind of part of that mild and

91
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,079
moderate stress so the control treatment

92
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,119
was considered to be the standard for

93
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,959
the facility

94
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,280
to control which is what normally

95
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,640
happens with irrigation occurring events

96
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,959
for the plants occurring every

97
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,199
two to three days mild stress was

98
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,719
irrigation applied every two days

99
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,479
and then moderate stress was irrigation

100
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,759
applied every three days

101
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,359
so here we can see that's how you're

102
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,959
getting that mild stress even though the

103
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
treatment was basically the same

104
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,319
the amount that it was applied was

105
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:23,280
different that does put a moderate

106
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,919
stress on the plants when you're

107
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,799
watering only every three days

108
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,598
so when we've got that bud dry yield for

109
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,439
flower

110
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,199
so i'm only presenting grass here that

111
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,039
show statistic difference

112
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,560
note that there was determined to be no

113
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,280
significant difference in the flowering

114
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,840
of the whole plant dry flower in cycle 1

115
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
or the bud dry flower and cycle 3. what

116
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
was different here in cycle 2 and they

117
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,519
did multiple replications of this

118
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,039
dry bud mass was measured after the

119
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,120
drying period by removing

120
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,560
all the buds from the plant the control

121
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,000
treatment was significantly different

122
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
from the mild and moderate stress

123
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,878
treatments

124
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,079
as we can see here dry blood mass was

125
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,518
definitely more

126
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
in those control treatments compared to

127
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,560
the mild and moderate stress

128
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,318
remember the mild moderate stress we're

129
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,680
also looking at the changes

130
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,039
in irrigation frequency now

131
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,120
important components when we're talking

132
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,438
about cannabis we'll be looking at the

133
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,000
example here would be the thc percent

134
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,519
percent by mass for the flower note

135
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,358
there was it was determined to be no

136
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,120
significant difference in the following

137
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,439
being the tg presented by mass and

138
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,319
flowering cycle one as well as cycle

139
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,199
three

140
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,319
here the percent in cycle sorry cycle

141
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,600
two and cycle three

142
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,040
what was different was the thc percent

143
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,919
by mass for cycle

144
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
one the thc percent was significantly

145
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,639
different

146
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,799
in the mild stress treatment so here

147
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,879
we're seeing the thc by mass

148
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
was the same in both the control and

149
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,079
moderate stress

150
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,679
in this example the mild stress actually

151
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,719
caused a reduction

152
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,879
on the percent of thc by mass there so

153
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
kind of an interesting note

154
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,918
now the essential analysis of buds for

155
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,439
the three flowering cycles this kind of

156
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,039
brings that general summary here and i

157
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,839
tried to stack them right on top of one

158
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,280
another here

159
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,959
you're welcome to pause the video and

160
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,159
look at this in more detail

161
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,279
solving cycle one elemental analysis of

162
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,039
bud after flushing

163
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,478
shows a percentage of concentration by

164
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,719
mass of the nutrients

165
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,599
within the dry bud era bars represent

166
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,880
standard error

167
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,479
there's no significant difference

168
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,038
between any of the treatments in all

169
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,159
size

170
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,360
so if you're kind of looking through and

171
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,400
saying oh where are the differences

172
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,240
between these

173
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,758
really as far as the researchers go they

174
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
determine there's no significant

175
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,240
difference between any of the treatments

176
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,599
looking at the control the mild stress

177
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
flushed the mild stress

178
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,120
no flush moderate stress flush moderate

179
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
stress no flush

180
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,160
looking at the different flowering

181
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,639
cycles looking at the percent nitrogen

182
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,680
sulfur phosphorus potassium magnesium

183
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,759
and calcium

184
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,680
no significant differences across any of

185
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,800
these very important note there

186
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,959
people always want to see a difference

187
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
in their treatments but in this case no

188
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,719
difference

189
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,320
is also an important result

190
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,680
so it's also we're looking here looking

191
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,478
at the water reduction from the

192
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,038
treatments

193
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,318
so we see the uh volume in liters of

194
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,639
irrigation applied

195
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,520
number of irrigation events uh added

196
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,199
flush amount

197
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,120
total liters per plant and percent

198
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,400
reduction using the control the 10 liter

199
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,639
flush being the

200
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,159
um standard in the sense that every that

201
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,918
uses the most water

202
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
everything else uses less water uh 22.9

203
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,599
percent

204
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:20,560
up to 45.7 percent less water

205
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,680
we're looking here at just kind of the

206
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,038
information

207
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,879
we're looking at the moderate stress

208
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,159
treatments was able to reduce water

209
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,600
use by over 45 percent so that's great

210
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,199
from a production standpoint if you're

211
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,439
able to reduce that water

212
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,199
bill by that much minus just treatments

213
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,918
were looking around 25

214
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,400
and removing that 10 liter initial flush

215
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,279
was still

216
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,918
able to reduce water use by almost 23

217
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,119
percent

218
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,839
so important notes to take into

219
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,199
consideration now what's the general

220
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,279
summary well when we're looking at kind

221
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,960
of reducing that water reducing the

222
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,198
irrigation frequency there were

223
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,439
large reductions in water use with

224
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
little impact on overall yield

225
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,478
in thc concentration so here we are

226
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
saving water

227
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,240
but really not impacting the overall

228
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,478
yield or thc concentrations

229
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,720
that's a great thing removing the two

230
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,918
time 10 liter flush reduced water use in

231
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,840
the same treatment

232
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,519
without the two time 10 liter flush by

233
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,719
22.9 percent

234
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,719
with the non-significant impacts on dry

235
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,080
yield and thc concentrations

236
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,280
so again this is great to see no

237
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,318
difference in dry yield and

238
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,638
concentrations

239
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,840
and we're reducing water another option

240
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,079
for using water is to

241
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,318
use examine the flushing practices

242
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,159
particularly late in the growing cycle

243
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,240
a significant reduction in water use for

244
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,120
irrigation will lead not only to

245
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,120
reduction in

246
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,959
water bill but lead to a significant

247
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,639
reduction in the humidity within the air

248
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,719
handling system

249
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,240
must be you know contented as well so

250
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,599
less water added

251
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,199
less humidity less stress on your

252
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,839
ability to kind of go through and

253
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
regulate that environment

254
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,439
flushing nutrients from the substrate so

255
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,758
the practice of flushing is a

256
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,038
current common industry practice but

257
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,879
there's really no

258
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,478
evidence in published literature of its

259
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,240
effectiveness in reducing nutrient

260
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,959
concentrations within the bud

261
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,759
or even whether or not it's a desirable

262
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,439
result

263
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,038
this result showed that the intended

264
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,719
purpose of flushing to reduce nutrient

265
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,360
concentrations within the bud

266
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,560
really has no effect the data shows that

267
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,560
for the last two weeks of the flower

268
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,079
cycle in cannabis it was possible to use

269
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,759
no fertilizer water

270
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,240
for irrigation with no significant

271
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,439
impact and yield while saving input cost

272
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,478
on fertilizer so that's a great

273
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,199
conclusion

274
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,918
if you're looking at the end adding just

275
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,000
water

276
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,439
flushing the nutrients maybe not doing

277
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,958
the flushing of the nutrients

278
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,879
but it really didn't change any of the

279
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,359
nutrient concentrations in the final dry

280
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,879
flour

281
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,200
really did not change the the

282
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,439
concentration why is that significant

283
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
well you can forego any fertile

284
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,800
fertilizer additives in the last two

285
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,000
weeks cutting down your cost

286
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,240
cutting down your potential for

287
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,440
environmental contamination with not

288
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,480
impacting your final product so this

289
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,120
applies to both

290
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,560
indoor as well as outdoor growers while

291
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,240
there is a difference for each growing

292
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,439
environment the same general concept

293
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,600
does apply

294
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
specifics for each are provided in other

295
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,639
videos if you want to know some more

296
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,439
details for best fit your growing

297
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,759
conditions

298
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,959
but the key part is here we are really

299
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,879
approaching that really close to

300
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,838
flowering and harvesting stage in that

301
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,000
flowering cycle

302
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,600
that flowering cycle is coming to an end

303
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,080
you may be able to get away without

304
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,560
adding any more costly fertilizer

305
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,480
and having no change or reduction in

306
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,000
your total yield now the amount of

307
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
duration of time that you would

308
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,320
forego the nutrients may depend of

309
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,879
course on your growing media

310
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,160
soil having the longest duration of time

311
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,519
and hydroponics having the least

312
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,759
duration of time that you would

313
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,120
be watering your plants with only pure

314
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,879
water but again this

315
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,639
is great to kind of know and understand

316
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,519
to help reduce not only your potential

317
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,080
water bill

318
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,879
but also to reduce your fertilizer cost

319
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,278
with no

320
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,278
impact on your final end product
