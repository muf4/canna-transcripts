00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,399
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,278
going over drug

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,278
classification we're going to look at

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,879
different classes and schedules

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:12,320
for some example drugs now first off

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,759
it's important to remember that united

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,759
states code the usc

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,760
for controlled substances act provides a

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,920
list in rating scale called schedules

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,160
and we'll see some of those here

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,920
the drug potency potential for abuse

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,118
likelihood for physical dependency and

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,519
medical implications

14
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,518
are all factored into the scheduling

15
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,839
also this act establishes penalties

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,799
for offenses and we can kind of see the

17
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,359
website link

18
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,039
provided here when this video was

19
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,719
originally created

20
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,719
so the control substances act or the

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,439
schedules are scheduled one two three

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,160
four and five schedule one is considered

23
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,759
to be the

24
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,479
highest year the highest potential for

25
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,599
abuse no current accepted medical use

26
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,718
united states

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,640
lack of an acceptable level of safety

28
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,239
and use under medical supervision we see

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,679
some examples there

30
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,878
now when we look at the examples

31
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,840
probably the one that's under most

32
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,718
scrutiny

33
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
uh is marijuana as far as does it fit

34
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,320
all of these schedule one

35
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
characteristics we're going down we see

36
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,199
schedule two

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
a high potential for abuse schedule

38
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
three is less potential for abuse in a

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
schedule one or two

40
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,520
and so on and so on you see the

41
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,200
precipitous downward

42
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,798
scale all the way down to schedule five

43
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,040
where it's a low potential

44
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,840
for abuse there's also some examples

45
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,080
provided

46
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,400
as far as what currently is classified

47
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,478
in all of these different schedules

48
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,320
in addition to scheduling we also have

49
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,078
general classifications

50
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,359
so here are some general classifications

51
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,000
such as

52
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,078
depressants hallucinogens inhalants we

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,319
see marijuana also listed here narcotics

54
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,239
steroid stimulants and synthetic drugs

55
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,398
some of the effects typically associated

56
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,920
with them and at the very last column

57
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,359
here some examples

58
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,118
so you're welcome to take a look at this

59
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,519
not going to go or even go through all

60
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,920
this

61
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,519
but this just shows some classifications

62
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,640
of different drugs

63
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,840
and some of the effects and examples

64
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,840
for those drugs
