1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,359
okay here I'm gonna give you a brief

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,119
overview of understanding the disease

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,709
triangle how that we see indicated here

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,900
we have three different components

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,699
coming together to triangulate and form

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,440
the occurrence of disease now the host

7
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:20,100
or susceptible host is the plant in this

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,960
case and the pathogen is another word

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,420
for the disease the environment are the

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,339
conditions that's occurring so no

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,510
disease when there's no interception we

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,428
have the host in the proper environment

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,309
but there's no pathogen present at the

14
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:33,929
same time you don't get disease same

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,269
thing if you have the host and a

16
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,840
pathogen without favorable environmental

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,809
conditions

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,160
you still will not get a disease what

19
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:43,890
happens to when all three of these come

20
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,359
into intersection with one another when

21
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,489
all three of these are present at the

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,869
same time you get this scenario that

23
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:51,149
develops and this is where disease will

24
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:52,589
occur when all these intersect that's

25
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,840
are you getting a triangulation in that

26
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,059
disease that forms there needs to be all

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,190
three components interacting for the

28
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,899
occurrence of a disease if only one is

29
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,988
missing then the triangle will simply

30
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,299
fall apart so in order despite getting

31
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:08,069
disease cursing is very easy it's

32
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,960
actually a combination of factors that

33
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,478
are all coming together at the same time

34
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,188
for that disease to occur and what those

35
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,200
environmental conditions may be what

36
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,089
that pathogen is will be dependent on

37
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,728
the form or type of disease that's

38
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,350
present but still with the host the

39
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:24,118
environment in the pathogen all coming

40
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,319
together at the same time that's where

41
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,509
you get disease and upsetting this

42
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,078
triangle can be a great way to offer

43
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:35,569
control and not allow disease to occur

44
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,569
at a particular plant host here
