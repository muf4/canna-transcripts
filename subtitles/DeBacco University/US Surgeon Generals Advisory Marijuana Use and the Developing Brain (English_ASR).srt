1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,359
so this debaco university video is going

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,080
to look at the

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,119
u.s surgeon general's advisory regarding

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:16,800
marijuana use

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:18,160
in the developing brain

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
all right let's get into u.s surgeons

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,839
general's advisory regarding marijuana

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,439
use and the developing brain

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,278
so first off marijuana is during

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
pregnancy and a lot of

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,198
information is going to have proper

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
citations that you're welcome to look at

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,480
marijuana's use during pregnancy can

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,558
affect the developing fetus

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,319
thc can enter the fetal brain from the

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,479
mother's bloodstream

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,159
it may disrupt the endocannabinoid

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,959
system which is important for a healthy

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,599
pregnancy

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520
and fetal brain development studies have

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,640
shown that marijuana use in pregnancy is

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,280
associated with

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,160
adverse outcomes including lower birth

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,239
weight

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,479
the colorado pregnancy risk assessment

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,558
monitoring system reported that

27
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,759
maternal marijuana use was associated

28
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,479
with a 50

29
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,479
increase in risk of low birth weight

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,198
regardless of the maternal age

31
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,319
race ethnicity education and also

32
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,679
tobacco use

33
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,158
kind of important there and a little

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,680
concerning we look at marijuana during

35
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,080
adolescence

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
so the human brain continues to develop

37
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,599
from before birth

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,400
into the mid-20s and it's vulnerable to

39
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,959
the effects

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,560
of addictive substances and again this

41
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,079
is more than cannabis but this is also

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,240
looking at thc

43
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,679
and marijuana in general here we can

44
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,078
kind of see different regions of the

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,560
brain and how tht may affect those

46
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,879
so they can affect areas of our brain

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,960
that control balance and coordination

48
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,118
so kind of like many of the green areas

49
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,000
then went under the influence of the

50
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,159
frontal cortex

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
which being located in this area

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,159
decision making becomes impaired

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,399
marijuana can affect the frontal cortex

54
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,799
involved in the decision making process

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,040
nthc affects the cerebrum during which

56
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,640
to condul the feeling of pain

57
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,320
all things that can affect particularly

58
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,359
teenager adolescence brain

59
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:01,599
in addition uh frequent marijuana can

60
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,280
marijuana use can during adolescence is

61
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,000
associated with a whole bunch of other

62
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,280
challenges as well changes of the brain

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,439
involved in tension

64
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,560
memory decision making and also

65
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,400
motivation

66
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
deficits in attention to memory have

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,879
been detected in marijuana

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
using teens even after a month of

69
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:19,598
abstinence

70
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,119
impaired learning in adolescence chronic

71
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,679
use is linked to

72
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,039
declines in iq school performance that

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,280
jeopardizes professional

74
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,560
as well as social achievements and life

75
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
satisfaction

76
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,159
increased rates of school absence and

77
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,519
dropout as well as

78
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,959
suicide attempts all negative impacts of

79
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,719
chronic marijuana use during adolescence

80
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,319
there's also psychotic disorders as well

81
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,199
the risk of early onset psychotic

82
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,919
disorders such as

83
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,359
schizophrenia is possible the risk for

84
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,639
these disorders increases with the

85
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,640
frequency of use

86
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,079
the potency of the marijuana product in

87
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,919
the age at first

88
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,560
use decreased and as well as other

89
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,238
substances

90
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,640
used there can be compounding effects as

91
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,080
well so again these are just reasons for

92
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,000
looking at and reasons really for

93
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,519
concern now

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,239
lastly here we're just going to look at

95
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,200
teens so in 2017

96
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,599
teens the age 12 to 17 reported frequent

97
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,839
use

98
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,719
of marijuana showed 130 percent greater

99
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,878
likelihood

100
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,479
of misusing opioids this is based on the

101
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,239
information presented here

102
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,679
also teams mixing prescription opioids

103
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,878
with other substances it also sadly

104
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,000
works the other way

105
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,079
those teens who reported co-ingestion

106
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,158
of prescription opioids with other drugs

107
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,360
were eight times more likely to

108
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,439
abuse marijuana so it can work both ways

109
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,959
so this is important to realize that the

110
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,919
brain does continue developing to the

111
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,759
mid-20s

112
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,280
and u.s surgeon general does have some

113
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,479
concerns posted here

114
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,039
regarding cannabis and thc as well as

115
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,119
other

116
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,719
products as well so again just take this

117
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,158
all into consideration

118
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,680
for any drug you're looking at

119
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,679
potentially consuming
