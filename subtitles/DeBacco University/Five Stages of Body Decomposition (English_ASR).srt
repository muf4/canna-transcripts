1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,419
so in this video here at tobacco

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,700
University we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,160
and breaking down the five stages of

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,960
body decomposition of starting with

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,179
fresh going to blow active Decay

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,620
Advanced Decay and ending with dry

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,120
remains

8
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,939
so keep in mind that when we're looking

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,439
at this rate of decomposition there are

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,020
several factors that will impact that

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,300
for example age the younger decompose

12
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,219
quicker than older people size

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,019
overweight people will decompose faster

14
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,000
than the average weight person clothing

15
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,339
naked bodies will decompose faster than

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,799
if they were clothed health is sick will

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,820
decompose faster than healthy

18
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,738
environmental temperatures in the range

19
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,299
of 70 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit will

20
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,820
result in the quickest decomposition

21
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:44,339
times and location decomposition is

22
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,399
faster in air and slower in water or

23
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,859
soil so take these various factors into

24
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,980
consideration for specific situations

25
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:55,079
but here's going to be the basic of five

26
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,878
stages of progression the rate at which

27
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,079
may change based on the factors I just

28
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,419
mentioned there

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,058
so starting with the fresh stage well

30
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,680
this is it starts at the point of death

31
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,019
and this continues for the first two

32
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,880
days now flies will start to arrive the

33
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,640
temperature will fall to ambient which

34
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,859
is the surrounding temperature of the

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,719
victim or individual the abdomen will

36
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,019
start to bloat due to gases produced by

37
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:22,500
the anaerobic bacteria liver rigor and

38
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:24,060
algor mortis occur in this fresh stage

39
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,459
and we can see an example of this of a

40
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,159
pig at the fresh stage of decomposition

41
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:31,618
the first stage then we go to bloat

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,359
stage one of the putrification stages

43
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,060
this is evident by activities of

44
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,578
microorganisms typically around day four

45
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,500
gases will be noticed skin may turn a

46
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,359
greenish coloration the skin may start

47
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,819
to break and fluids May flow out of

48
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,039
certain openings and we can see here

49
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,798
that same pig as the first image going

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,380
through now the bloat stage progressing

51
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,799
from the bloat stage we then go on to

52
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,718
the active Decay stage so in this active

53
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,880
Decay stage it's denoted by the great

54
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:01,559
loss in Mass mainly due to maggot

55
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,500
feeding and occurs about six to eight

56
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,420
day time frame portions of the skin may

57
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,639
turn black gases will start to escape

58
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,979
and the space is considered to end when

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,378
the maggots leave the body and we can

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,780
see these breakdown now in the

61
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:19,019
noticeable evidence here of the change

62
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,598
in coloration of our original Pig here

63
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,300
at the Active Decay stage or black

64
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,238
putrification is also may be known as

65
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,219
continuing on to advance Decay this

66
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,099
where the body begins to dry and

67
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:34,259
preserve itself in the 10 to 20 day time

68
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:36,598
frame most of the flesh is gone at this

69
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,899
point odor and insect activities are in

70
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,699
the decrease waxy layer May develop and

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,019
kind of this waxy soap like substance

72
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:44,818
that forms on the corpse during

73
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,920
decomposition under specific conditions

74
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:49,619
some refer to as what's called kind of

75
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:52,679
grave wax and this is evident or would

76
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,120
be occurring during the advanced Decay

77
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,239
stage

78
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,800
and lastly we have the driver Mains and

79
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,259
this is the final stage and this is the

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,540
50 plus a day range this is the loss of

81
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:05,699
everything the body except the dry bone

82
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:08,039
so this driving main stage also known as

83
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:11,158
the skeletalization phase simply because

84
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,658
only the skeleton only the bones are

85
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,658
left from this stage on
