1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,560
okay here I'm gonna go over some very

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,449
common respiratory diseases

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,730
starting with chronic pulmonary

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,490
obstructive disease or abbreviated

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,620
commonly COPD this is exemplified by

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,809
chronic bronchitis and obstructive

7
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,829
emphysema patients typically have a

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:22,198
history of smoking dyspnea coffee and

9
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:23,608
frequently I just mean again as labored

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,519
breathing occurs and the recipe gets

11
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,650
worse overall COPD victims develop

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:31,488
respiratory failure coming by headaches

13
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:34,199
toxemia carbon dioxide retention and

14
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,850
respiratory acidosis how does this

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,129
actually occur what's occurring in these

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,969
individuals if you look at normal lungs

17
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,409
and the alveoli we see a very high

18
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,079
amount of surface area which is

19
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:48,148
important to allow this gas exchange

20
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,539
those individuals with COPD we notice

21
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,899
those alveoli are destroyed forming

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,000
fewer but larger structures here this

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,250
limits or reduces the amount of

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,350
efficient the transfer of gases that can

25
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,558
occur as a result you can get all of

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,439
these negative symptoms that do sadly

27
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,140
plague this particular individual moving

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,389
on from COPD we have asthma something

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,879
you might be familiar with typically

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,259
more common in children than adults it's

31
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,509
characterized by shortness of breath

32
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,219
wheezing and chest tightness the cue

33
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,140
inflammation of Airways precedes the

34
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,140
bronchial spasms so what's actually

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,269
occurring in asthma is our normal

36
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,590
pathway for air it's quite large and as

37
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:30,959
when we have this constriction that's

38
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,609
occurring could be thickening of the

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,978
airway wall could be the destruction

40
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,900
could be the presence of mucus all of

41
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,060
these can lead to asthma like symptoms

42
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,630
this could be caused by an immune

43
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,450
response is airway inflammation caused

44
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:47,819
by the il-4 and il-5 which stimulate

45
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,280
antibodies and recruit implements and

46
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,529
inflammatory cells

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,259
I always thicken with inflammation mucus

48
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,570
and magnify the effect this is typically

49
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,640
thought of if people try to replicate

50
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,618
this or simulate this be like instead of

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,049
breathing to a normal airway to breeze

52
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,390
through a very thin a small straw which

53
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,360
restricting the ability for air to come

54
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,889
in and also for air to come out you see

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,349
the current asthma rate and prevalence

56
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,708
by age sex and race

57
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:18,869
Missa T so by age child is more likely

58
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,340
to become affected than adult females

59
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,709
for whatever reason are more likely than

60
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,799
males and compared whites blacks and

61
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,840
Hispanic races black is tends to be a

62
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:31,290
little bit higher than the Hispanic in

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,590
white inhalers are common ways to reduce

64
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:37,769
the short term effectiveness of having

65
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:41,069
this potential issue occur lung cancer

66
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:42,718
is another arm sadly respiratory disease

67
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:44,688
accounts for about one third of all

68
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:47,158
cancer deaths in the United States

69
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:49,650
90% of all patients with lung cancer

70
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:52,709
were at once smokers there's three

71
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,989
common types these all fall under the

72
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,900
category of lung cancer there's squamous

73
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,090
cell carcinoma there's aDNA carcinoma

74
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,188
small cell carcinomas I could get too

75
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,989
much in the specifics but simply what's

76
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:05,789
occurring here is we have our nice

77
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:07,829
healthy lungs and we have our sad they

78
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:10,048
are affected lungs with smoke it was

79
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:13,590
increasing the rate or the chance

80
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:15,419
dramatically of contracting lung cancer

81
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,759
if you look on the packets of cigarettes

82
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,009
they do warn you about smoking can cause

83
00:03:17,758 --> 00:03:22,708
lung cancer in addition to the lung

84
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:26,938
cancer it's also heart disease and many

85
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,378
other it's having negative effects so

86
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:30,508
the question comes up commonly about

87
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:33,149
what about e-cigarettes so we all know

88
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:34,529
that the traditional smoking has those

89
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,900
warnings without a cigarettes

90
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,180
those are smokeless tobacco and water

91
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,039
pipes and may cause serious potential

92
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,659
health problems though this can include

93
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,638
cancer because of the chemicals and

94
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:47,008
toxins that they contained actually

95
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,409
currently an act of e-cigarette lawsuit

96
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:51,839
for a lack of a cancer warning because

97
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:53,969
of the potential health risk the US Food

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,829
and Drug Administration you know them as

99
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,389
the FDA has started regulating these

100
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,259
products like other tobacco products

101
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:03,569
such as cigarettes on August 8th of 2016

102
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:05,250
instead of burning tobacco they

103
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:06,869
generally are contained cartridges

104
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,598
filled with nicotine and other chemicals

105
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:12,840
and it's because it's not an actual

106
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,179
smoking or burning of a potential leaf

107
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,608
or other product there is cancer

108
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,650
associated risk you're welcome to check

109
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:21,478
out the links I provided you with they

110
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,579
kind of stressed some of the point of

111
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,789
some of the potential risks with me

112
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:29,099
cigarettes lastly looking at

113
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,800
the country a lung cancer incidence the

114
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,200
above map shows lung cancer incidence in

115
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,970
the United States you can see the region

116
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,529
here and the south tents have a little

117
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,330
bit higher incidence of lung cancer

118
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:41,549
there's a lack of uniform in the

119
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:42,569
population percentage that smoke in this

120
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,819
suggests there may be other

121
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:47,550
environmental factors to consider most

122
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:49,769
carcinogens are also mute engines so

123
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,110
while smoking can increase your lung

124
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:53,549
cancer chance there's not necessarily a

125
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,830
direct correlation there's some other

126
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,500
factors also playing into that however

127
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:00,149
when we look at this data looking at our

128
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,300
cigarette smoked in our lung cancer

129
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:04,589
deaths we do see a definite correlation

130
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,240
after the incidence of smoking began to

131
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:08,699
increase the United States so did the

132
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,490
instance of lung cancer cigarette smoke

133
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,219
contains these powerful mutant the gyms

134
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,350
benzo purine spine 2 3 sites at the p53

135
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,720
gene these mutations at these sites

136
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,700
activate the gene research has found

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,970
that the p53 gene is activating 70

138
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,009
percent of all lung cancers so this is

139
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,870
showing this correlation here and

140
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,670
nicotine in cigarette smoke is also a

141
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,280
very addictive drug so you can have

142
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,230
other negative side effects think the

143
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,489
important thing to look at this graph or

144
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,290
at least to kind of give hope for the

145
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,960
future is that while cigarette smoking

146
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,060
did increase ended lung cancer deaths

147
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,509
noticed a decrease in cigarettes being

148
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,000
smoked and a decrease in lung cancer

149
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:49,889
keep in mind that each cigarettes are

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,750
also have their potential cancer risks

151
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:54,810
so just because you're not smoking a

152
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:59,149
traditional cigars cigarette there's

153
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,149
also cancer risk associated with those
