1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
okay this video lecture is going to

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,080
focus on the process of transpiration

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,440
just basically water movement through a

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,439
plant in the roots

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,679
through the stem and out the leaves it's

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,399
important uh for many aspects of the

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,559
plant one

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,599
in particular cooling as well as moving

9
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,839
nutrients

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,719
so we're looking at the transpiration

11
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,480
process

12
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,399
we have water movement in the plant we

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,920
have the vascular plants have conducting

14
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,598
systems for transporting fluids and

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,760
nutrients to the plant

16
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,359
water and minerals enter through the

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
roots and are transported

18
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,840
through in the xylem we see the xylem

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,679
look pictured here on the left

20
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,960
carbohydrates are synthesized by the

21
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,878
photosynthetic process

22
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
and are transported through the plant in

23
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,280
the phloem we see that on the right here

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,000
these little red circles represent the

25
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,558
sucrose or

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
sugars you'll notice that the water or

27
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,280
xylem

28
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,480
goes from the bottom of the plant

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,239
towards the top

30
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,000
phloem in this instance is kind of

31
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,038
moving downwards but it can move

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
anywhere

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,079
so phloem is able to go up or down the

34
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,558
plant xylem is going

35
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,840
mainly from the roots to the shoots as

36
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,198
we call it from the bottom

37
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,198
all the way up and through the plant in

38
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,879
that one direction

39
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,399
now the flow of minerals in and out and

40
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,319
within the plant we see here

41
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,920
water is passively transported into the

42
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,399
roots that enters the xylem and we can

43
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,960
see that here at picture number one

44
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,960
as we look here in the stem region the

45
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,559
forces of cohesion and adhesion cause

46
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,719
water molecules to form

47
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,240
in a column of xylem these are little

48
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,319
water molecules and this is looking at

49
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,759
the xylem it's in the plant and number

50
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,438
three here the water moves from the

51
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,879
xylem to the mesophyll cells

52
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,118
evaporates from their surfaces and

53
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,118
leaves to the plant by diffusion

54
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,159
through the stomata that's how it's

55
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,239
going to lead is water

56
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,359
vapor and this whole process escapes

57
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,478
repeating this is why you have to

58
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,000
constantly water

59
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,118
on your house plants for example because

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,078
they're constantly going through this

61
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,118
transpiration

62
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,078
process now root pressure several

63
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,239
factors

64
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,000
are at work to move water up the height

65
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,519
of the plant you can see water entering

66
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
here at the root hairs

67
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,640
those are the very fine areas and that's

68
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,399
where water is going to be coming in

69
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,079
the initial movement of water into roots

70
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,680
involves osmosis

71
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,118
and water moves into the cells at the

72
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,640
root because the fluid in the xylem

73
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,519
contains more solutes than its

74
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,239
surroundings

75
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,598
these solutes in the cell here are more

76
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,640
densely packed with

77
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,199
for example sugars and nutrients and

78
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,039
ions

79
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,560
that water through osmosis is naturally

80
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,039
going to want to move into those root

81
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,479
hairs

82
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,479
ultimately entering the xylem and moving

83
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,079
up through the plant this asthmatic

84
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,759
force is called root pressure

85
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
but by itself it's not sufficient to

86
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,519
push the water up the plant stem

87
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,719
and we kind of see another example here

88
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
of the water surrounding the soil

89
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,080
particles entering the root hairs

90
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
ultimately working its way into the

91
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,120
xylem there's more to it than just this

92
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,000
to create a sufficient root pressure

93
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,360
there's also the solute potential and

94
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,199
this is represented

95
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,360
by the symbol here the solute potential

96
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,359
is caused the osmotic potential

97
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,040
water moves in response the difference

98
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,959
in water potential between the two

99
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,878
systems the left and right side of the

100
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,479
tube so in a perfectly balanced system

101
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,399
we see the water at the same height on

102
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,158
the left and the right of the tube

103
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
because there is a difference in water

104
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,679
potential water will move from the soil

105
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,800
to the plant's roots

106
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
root cells via the process of osmosis we

107
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,360
see

108
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,319
here we have some solutes water is

109
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
naturally going to move

110
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,280
towards those sides we want to try to

111
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,239
dilute those solutes through this

112
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,560
semi-permeable

113
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,599
membrane this is why solute potential is

114
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,759
sometimes called

115
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,039
called osmotic potential now there's

116
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,560
other ways we could add positive

117
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,079
pressure if we add pressure we could

118
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,000
force water to kind of move

119
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,440
and increase this side of the tube if we

120
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,360
create a suction effect or a negative

121
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,759
pressure we could draw water

122
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,720
going this way so again pure water is

123
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,719
going to be even

124
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,158
but here's just a kind of a passive

125
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,239
example by adding solutes to a

126
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,598
semi-purple membrane the osmotic flow of

127
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,599
that water is going to shift to one side

128
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,199
this is occurring also in the help of

129
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,318
capillary action so in addition to root

130
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,479
pressure capillary action

131
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,639
adds to the pull put that in quotes

132
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,199
there to the moon of water up the stems

133
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,479
it's kind of not you know physical like

134
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,280
pull as you think like a pull of a

135
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,438
magnet

136
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,479
but what capillary action is doing is

137
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,878
it's the result

138
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,399
from tiny electrical attractions of

139
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,158
polar water molecules

140
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
to the surface that carry an electrical

141
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,399
charge this attraction is called

142
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
adhesion so we're looking at capillary

143
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,599
action

144
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,639
here we see a red liquid and we see

145
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,679
different diameter

146
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,319
tubes as the diameter of the tube is

147
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
getting smaller we're noticing that the

148
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,719
ability for that

149
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,680
red liquid to travel up the tube is

150
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,320
increasing

151
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,079
and we see that here we have our gradual

152
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,319
increases that gets smaller and finer

153
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,159
it's able to fight the force of gravity

154
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,199
and overcome that force to a greater

155
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,720
extent

156
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,079
this capital reaction is not strong

157
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,960
enough to help pull water up the stem

158
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,639
but this is a

159
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,638
again all these factors are coming

160
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,918
together helping the process

161
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,360
capital reaction depends a lot on the

162
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,639
radius of the tube and you can see again

163
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,360
those smaller radius

164
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,240
having the greatest degree of ability to

165
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,319
resist

166
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,400
the force of gravity a denser fluid and

167
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,120
the same two rises to a smaller height

168
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,519
than other

169
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,959
if other factors being equal so here

170
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,560
we're seeing a more dense material and a

171
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,399
less dense of equal diameter

172
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,720
and how that affects the degree of

173
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,239
capillary action

174
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
this adhesion and cohesion that i

175
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,478
mentioned keep in mind that cohesion

176
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,759
is like molecules sticking together we

177
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,519
see the two water molecules

178
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,199
sticking together two water molecules

179
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,399
sticking together because of the

180
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,960
hydrogen bonds it's cohesive

181
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,079
in adhesion dissimilar molecules are

182
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,439
sticking together

183
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,478
so water will interact in is charged

184
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:27,199
with polar molecules so here we have

185
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,918
the polarity of the water adhering or

186
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,759
sticking to the outside surface here

187
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,758
so it could be the water to the surface

188
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,439
of a leaf it could be water to the

189
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,000
interior parts of the xylem

190
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,600
it's that kind of water attaching or

191
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
adhering think of like a piece of tape

192
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,360
tape adhering to the wall adhering to

193
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,038
dust sticking to something other than

194
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
itself

195
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,680
now this transpiration how does this

196
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,959
kind of relate to this final

197
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,639
transpiration process

198
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,159
the final pulls the process of moving

199
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,280
water up the plant chute is this

200
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
transpiration

201
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,359
water evaporating from the tops of the

202
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,520
leaves is the tube that pulls the column

203
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
of water to through the bottom roots

204
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,639
the column of water does not collapse

205
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,280
because water molecules are attracted to

206
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,720
each other

207
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,198
this is the process again called

208
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,000
cohesion the narrower the diameter of

209
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,000
the tube the

210
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,839
more tensile strength that will occur or

211
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,279
resistance to separation of the water

212
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,079
column that'll help again move that

213
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,959
water up

214
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,000
through the plant that transpiration by

215
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,000
which the plant is

216
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,639
leaving the the plant leaf in this case

217
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,560
so more than 90 of the water taken in by

218
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,079
the plant is lost to the atmosphere

219
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,680
mostly through the leaves and

220
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,199
specifically through the stomata the

221
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,959
leaves the pores

222
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,560
water first passes into the pockets of

223
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,279
air in the spongy mesophyll

224
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,280
and then evaporates out the stomata high

225
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,719
humidity and low temperatures decrease

226
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,079
the rates of transpiration

227
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,000
so because we're talking the biological

228
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,439
system there are factors that do impact

229
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,600
this

230
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,038
the transpiration process in general

231
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,960
looking at kind of a nice uh

232
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,639
image here that a tree and this would be

233
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,120
true for even house plants

234
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,400
the cohesion intension theory of sap

235
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,000
ascent is shown

236
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,758
where we again having that water coming

237
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,079
through the root hairs those really fine

238
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,120
areas and then entering the xylem and

239
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,879
then working its way

240
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
with cohesive and adhesive properties

241
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,680
drawing water up through the xylem

242
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
ultimately reaching to the leaves uh

243
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,759
ultimately into the mesophyll cells

244
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,719
and then ultimately leaving out the

245
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,479
stomata

246
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,080
so evaporation from the mesophyll cells

247
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,439
produces a negative water potential

248
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,038
gradient that causes water to move

249
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,279
upward through the roots

250
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,360
and ultimately through the xylem you can

251
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,799
see that while the root cells are a

252
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,680
negative

253
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,598
pressure there is a greater negativity

254
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,079
of the atmosphere and the leaf tip so

255
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,719
this

256
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,519
in relation here because this is more

257
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,720
negative

258
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,560
water is being pulled in that direction

259
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,919
the atmosphere is very negative and

260
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,360
ultimately that's why it's going out the

261
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,038
stomata and that's why the stomata are

262
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,400
regulated to help reduce the amount of

263
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,478
water loss

264
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,318
now impacts on the transpiration rate

265
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,598
temperature as you see as we increase

266
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,280
temperature the rate of transpiration

267
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,478
will increase and then plateau to a

268
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,239
certain point

269
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,000
our wind velocity as the wind velocity

270
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,918
keeps increasing so does the rate of

271
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,560
transpiration

272
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,439
and kind of an opposite effect is

273
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,360
humidity

274
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,279
as you increase the humidity as you

275
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
increase the moisture that's in the air

276
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,878
the rate of transpiration will actually

277
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,439
inverse or decrease

278
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,280
so if there's more water in the air it's

279
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,199
harder for that water to evaporate and

280
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,439
therefore the rate of transpiration will

281
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,360
decrease for that plant

282
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,279
now this stomata as you mentioned are

283
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,960
regulated when guard cells

284
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,478
are plump and swollen they're said to be

285
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,560
turgid and they're going to be

286
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,598
having that stomata be open as we can

287
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,038
see here

288
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,559
when those kind of lose their water

289
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,080
they'll kind of collapse and collapse

290
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,119
and close on themselves

291
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,399
this is allowing the plant to reduce the

292
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,879
amount of water loss

293
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,399
you can see again here where's certain

294
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,080
environmental stresses

295
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,519
that can relate to that there can be

296
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,200
hormones that can affect that

297
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,278
but when those cells are nice and

298
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,839
swollen they're open allowing for water

299
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,519
exchange

300
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,519
and then when that water is lost they

301
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,039
will close

302
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,399
balance between water and air so when a

303
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,000
plant has opened their stomata they can

304
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,600
breathe and exchange carbon dioxide and

305
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,120
oxygen which is what they need to do

306
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,278
however when the stomata are open the

307
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,879
plant is also losing water and runs the

308
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,240
risk of dehydrating

309
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,519
so this is why plants want to be

310
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
regulating this process because they

311
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,799
want to maintain

312
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,080
a high degree of tertiary pressure but

313
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,679
if they leave their stomach open for too

314
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,800
long though you can wilt and die

315
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,120
so that's why they're constantly

316
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,639
regulating this to a certain point that

317
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,519
if you don't water the plant that's in

318
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,000
the container

319
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,560
it's ultimately going to wither away and

320
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,679
sadly

321
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,119
perish so if you do provide plants with

322
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,879
the right amount of water they can

323
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,759
regulate fine and grow

324
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:31,120
if they're not they're going to go

325
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,639
through a wilting process if you don't

326
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
want them for an extended period of time

327
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,799
and they do need the water

328
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,000
they ultimately will burn and die due to

329
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,439
dehydration

330
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,440
so what are your plants
