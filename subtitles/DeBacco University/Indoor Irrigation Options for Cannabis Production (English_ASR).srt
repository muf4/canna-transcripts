00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,560
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,359
where if you're growing plants indoors

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,879
and wondering how you can irrigate them

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:17,920
or what options you have

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,920
this is the video for you

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,519
all right let's get into indoor

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,800
irrigation options for cannabis

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,039
production

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,480
first off you have to determine if the

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,400
plant needs water

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,719
by lifting the containers usually to

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,759
gauge the water weight

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,799
this is simply lifting the containers

14
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,519
particularly if you're growing in

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,159
containers

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,680
it's better to use sometimes than meters

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,599
meters can be used as a backup but

18
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,399
getting that literal feel of your plants

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,160
yourself

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,840
is probably the best method especially

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,599
early on to determine

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,879
whether or not they should be watering

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,520
them

24
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,439
now when to fertilize well fertilized

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,960
water should be added each time you

26
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,679
water your plants

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,719
with low doses the goal is to have these

28
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,479
low dose and feed

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,399
each and every day to allow plants to

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,000
maintain consistent growth

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,599
some growers will choose to do maybe a

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,359
six day in the seventh day they kind of

33
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,118
do a freshwater flush

34
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,640
but the key part here is getting away

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,680
from once a week fertilizing

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,200
to every day but lower the dose down so

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,320
you're just providing that little bit of

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,359
a consistent feed

39
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,000
to your plants now irrigation in general

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,920
is defined as the process of applying

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,400
controlled amounts of water to plants

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,478
at needed intervals how the water is

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,719
delivered is really up to the grower

44
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,239
ideally the plant's performance will not

45
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,039
differ among different irrigation

46
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,438
systems

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
if each is performed correctly so that's

48
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,559
why it's important to know the options

49
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,959
because there really isn't necessarily

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,439
one

51
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,640
best option that's a reason why there

52
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,239
are options

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,000
each method does have its own set of

54
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,519
advantages and disadvantages which is

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,478
why growers need to select quote the

56
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,920
best fit

57
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,959
for their operation so one option

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
would be basically growing

59
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,039
hydroponically and the advantage is it

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,320
can really allow for maximum yields and

61
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,520
it's used a lot in the lettuce industry

62
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,359
as we see here

63
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,879
however the disadvantages to this method

64
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,478
is that there's a smaller margin for

65
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,118
error when compared to buffered

66
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,560
substrates swings in ph for example can

67
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,360
occur very rapidly

68
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,080
in hydroponic setups then there is hand

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,680
watering

70
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
and that's advantage that allows for a

71
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,439
very specific

72
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,479
plant to plant care if one plant needs a

73
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,840
little bit more you can get a little bit

74
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,199
more one needs a little bit less you can

75
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,878
give it a little bit less

76
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,199
however the disadvantage is that this is

77
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,719
very time consuming and plants can be

78
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,399
missed especially if you're growing a

79
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,400
lot of plants

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
then there's the flood and drain or the

81
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
ebb and flow method and the advantage is

82
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,319
that this offers even watering it's

83
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,360
basically a table here that floods and

84
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,518
drains

85
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,400
this allows also for the aeration of the

86
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,680
root zone

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,239
however the disadvantages are the

88
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,800
initial cost and setup of equipment

89
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,759
as well as maintaining the equipment and

90
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,879
keeping it clean

91
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,199
from cycle to cycle then we have indoor

92
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,199
drip irrigation and the advantages is

93
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,039
that this is very easy to automate

94
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,399
and offers plant specific watering

95
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,479
because you can add these little

96
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,840
emitters to individual plants

97
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,518
the disadvantage is of course the

98
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
initial cost and setup of equipment

99
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,360
and also continually checking to ensure

100
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,920
all tubings

101
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
tubes and fittings are all functioning

102
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,479
and working properly

103
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,359
making sure filters aren't getting

104
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,439
clogged then lastly we have aeroponics

105
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,959
and the advantage of aeroponics is that

106
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,878
this allows for

107
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,360
efficient at delivering nutrients to the

108
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,280
roots it also allows for easy visual

109
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
inspection of the root structure

110
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,799
the disadvantage is that this is

111
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,439
dependent on electricity

112
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,000
and can become less efficient when dense

113
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,560
roots are

114
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
formed as far as depending on the exact

115
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,318
setup that you may have

116
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
so hopefully this offers some options

117
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,759
check out this

118
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,158
channel for more details on each of

119
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,598
these options for indoor irrigation

120
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,598
of your cannabis plants
