1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,160
so in this debaco University video I'm

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,318
going to add some information uh to the

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,359
question can tissue culture remove hop

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,359
latent viroid from cannabis plants

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,210
[Music]

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,420
all right something many Growers are

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,278
asking can tissue culture remove hot

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,720
plate and fibroid from cannabis plants

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,300
so let's get into a little bit more of

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,559
the complexities of this as we answer

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,920
this question

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,320
so this does not mean you can stop

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,359
testing or screening this is still a

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,939
needed component so a very important

15
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,920
part of the process by testing plants

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,979
that are infected they can be called out

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,359
as even tissue culture does not ensure a

18
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:46,979
clean plant and that's something a lot

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,200
of Growers I think of a misconception on

20
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,319
they think oh it is tissue culture I can

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,960
remove that small number of cells and

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,119
then I can remove the positivity of that

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,340
plant and I can clean that tissue

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,079
however culturing from a clean plant and

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,699
producing known complaints is a method

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,338
that can lead to kind of a clean

27
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,319
facility as you select out those that

28
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:09,420
are infected testing your skin should

29
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,158
still occur if you have employees or

30
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,680
bring other plant material in plan on

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,900
keeping a plant as a mother and you know

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,180
and you still should have a clean

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,799
facility so keep this in mind that

34
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,420
testing is not removed from the

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,618
operation even if you're going with

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,359
tissue culture

37
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,819
but looking specific at tissue culture

38
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,759
is this kind of the answer to this uh

39
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,099
fibroid based on hops it is possible to

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,780
clean uh tissue and eliminate the

41
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,118
passage of the thyroid to new tissue

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,400
serving things perfect I'm just going to

43
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,659
take some plants tissue culture them and

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,478
then don't have to worry about this

45
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,579
fibroid however the portion of the plant

46
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,679
the sample is taken and the cultivar

47
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:48,779
being used for the plant cells all have

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,880
an impact on the effectiveness of this

49
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,879
process however when multiple rounds are

50
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,280
done with testing or screening in

51
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,039
between it is possible to rid a line of

52
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,040
this viroid so it is possible but it's

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,479
not just not necessarily a one and done

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,799
so a lot of people think I'm just going

55
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,560
to tissue culture and I'll be all clean

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,539
well even tissue cultured that plant

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,979
could still potentially contain the

58
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,378
viroid

59
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,239
now when we're looking at sampling the

60
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,399
meristem or the top portion would be a

61
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,020
preferred region a teacher culture only

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,939
is a small number of cells so where

63
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,560
should you take them from well meristem

64
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,199
culture is the very top portion here

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,598
it's more advantageous compared to using

66
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,238
material from a node so it's possible to

67
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,560
get a nodal uh tissue culture but you

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,580
want to really go for the meristem if

69
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,979
you're worried about hopolate and

70
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,620
thyroid remember that the viral viral

71
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,419
load can vary by the plant and some

72
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,219
people think this is because the plant

73
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,899
grows quicker you know as the plant's

74
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,699
growing up we're kind of outgrowing

75
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,219
where that virus trying to go through

76
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,139
and run through the plant

77
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:51,719
that could potentially this may be true

78
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,878
to some extent the reality variety is

79
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,620
not very far away so when you're talking

80
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,199
about that Marathon the very very top

81
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,580
portion because that word is also going

82
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,979
to be running through that plant as well

83
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,780
so take that into consideration

84
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,039
common location based on tomatoes so

85
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,598
when it actually it's more likely to be

86
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,699
found above rather than below the

87
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:11,939
initial point of infection at least

88
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:14,039
initially it is very common in Roots and

89
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:16,019
this may be where the initially

90
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,818
concentrates so if you get a point of

91
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,158
infection up here it will probably

92
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:21,899
accumulate in The Roots first and then

93
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,598
work its way above that point infection

94
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,400
and then over about six weeks the data

95
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:27,899
seems to show it infects the entire

96
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,819
plant

97
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,439
you know people are looking to potatoes

98
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:34,079
because a lot of them are vegetatively

99
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,598
propagated often grower in tissue

100
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,519
culture to produce virus flea free plant

101
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:40,318
stock that will be used for a number of

102
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,900
years and then tissue culture repeat the

103
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,399
process to ensure clean tissue keep in

104
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,920
mind that canvas is slightly different

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,739
if I were slightly different but this is

106
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,780
something to consider that other plants

107
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,640
are being used as an initial protocol

108
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,900
and is showing potentially some

109
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,639
effectiveness

110
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,140
now why that meristem region or let's

111
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,458
look a really close version which you

112
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,378
may not have seen of that meristem

113
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,019
region this is the actual growing point

114
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:06,239
of that plant the very tip of the plant

115
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,000
has the fastest growing cells a lot of

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,340
mitosis occurring here so it may be able

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,039
to outpace the growth or spread of a

118
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,539
virus or in this case a thyroid this is

119
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,918
not a guarantee but it does help

120
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,439
potentially increase the odds of

121
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,819
generating virid flea plant tissue this

122
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,279
is why it should be taken from the

123
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:26,339
meristem and not the bud regions the

124
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,198
schools kind of outrun it not always

125
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:30,359
true but if you're going to sample from

126
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,860
a region that's where I would Target and

127
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,540
then still test those plants because

128
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,479
they still may show positive take

129
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,460
another meristem region another tissue

130
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,279
culture round and hopefully you can get

131
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:43,638
a clean plant and to create clean plant

132
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,638
stock
