00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,520
here on this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,399
we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,689
manual weeding methods to suppress weeds

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:15,838
in a cannabis field

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:17,278
[Music]

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,719
so something probably all done at one

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,879
time or another but we're going to look

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,000
at using manual methods to suppress

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:26,160
weeds in a cannabis field here

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,160
so first off manual weeding is this can

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,640
be the most effective weeding method

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,760
to be very precise however it does

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,079
require the most

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,120
time and also the most labor which can

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,239
make it prohibitive

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,759
in certain systems now increasing the

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,359
effectiveness of

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,599
manual weeding growers should have a

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,159
regular schedule when it comes to manual

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,559
weeding

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,279
depending on the weed pressure the

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,759
frequency

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
will be determined based on that going

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,759
more than seven day days though between

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,198
weeding events is not advised especially

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,280
early in the season

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,119
when high soil moisture and low plant

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,760
densities may make it more

29
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,558
weeds more aggressive to get established

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,359
and to

31
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,560
propagate now i'm going to watch the

32
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,719
weather when we're looking at

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,879
manual weeding because often rainstorm

34
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,478
rain rainstorms will delay

35
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,719
when weeding can be done so when in

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,519
doubt weed before a potential storm

37
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,759
even if it's before your planned day so

38
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,599
because it's soil being very heavy

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,439
being very wet and waterlogged can make

40
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,798
it a challenge to go through and weed

41
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,639
and it's also going to encourage

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,840
potentially more weeds to germinate and

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,960
grow

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,719
now what's the ideal time of day to weed

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,158
well well any time you can do it really

46
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,239
is best the

47
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,600
ideal time is actually the morning just

48
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,438
after sun up

49
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,199
this way any weeds removed will have

50
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:41,758
roots exposed to the hot portion of the

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,359
day

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,000
this will increase the odds of

53
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,078
desiccation weeding at sunset the weeds

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,478
may be able to re-root overnight

55
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,279
reducing your time efficiency this can

56
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,478
be because if you're just kind of

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,519
leaving some weeds in the field not

58
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,280
removing them

59
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,359
off site in a separate pail or a

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,960
container if you're just kind of going

61
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,718
through the loophole

62
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,000
it can be one way can be effective but

63
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,000
you want to do that typically more in

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,840
the morning

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,680
it's not advised that you actually till

66
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,840
your soil and this is not an

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
advised method because growers will

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,878
often run a tiller

69
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,878
to bury the weeds or that's what they

70
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,318
think however what growers may not

71
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,479
realize is that they are actually

72
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,079
bringing up or tilling up new weed seeds

73
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,878
and really not fixing the problem

74
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,319
just encouraging a repeatingness of that

75
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,759
problem

76
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,238
now if you simply go through and cut the

77
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,039
weeds this is called creating a sterile

78
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,319
seedbed

79
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,919
and you're removing the weeds that

80
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,958
germinate and slowly killing all the

81
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,878
available

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
weed seeds to reduce the pressure at

83
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,318
least ideally

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,239
as the season progresses now looking at

85
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,759
this sterilized seed bed i have a

86
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,360
separate video on this

87
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,039
and you're welcome to search the channel

88
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,920
for that topic so you can learn a little

89
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,400
bit more

90
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:51,119
about how that may fit your particular

91
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,120
growing system
