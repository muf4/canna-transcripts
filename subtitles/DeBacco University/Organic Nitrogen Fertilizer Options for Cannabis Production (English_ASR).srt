1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,639
here on debaco university we're going to

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,439
be investigating some organic forms of

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,679
nitrogen

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,679
which are important for plant growth and

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,480
[Music]

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,759
production

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,839
all right let's get into organic and

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,118
nitrogen fertilizer options for cannabis

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,679
production

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,320
so first off options for organic growers

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,439
uh there

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,560
are nitrogen only others and nitrogen

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,320
dominant ratio ones

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,839
so some of these contain only nitrogen

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,600
some contain blends of other

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,119
nutrients as well which is important to

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
take into consideration

18
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,679
recover blood meal fish fertilizers bat

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,920
guano as well as manure

20
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,119
in this video so let's start with the

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,120
blood meal first

22
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,959
well blood meal is a byproduct of the

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,959
slaughter house industry

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,399
waste basically it's one of the highest

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,759
concentrations of nitrogen

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,640
in any non-synthetic source even though

27
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,479
it is organic

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
it can be over applied so keep that in

29
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,000
mind and it can burn

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,119
plants due to the excessive ammonia that

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,359
would be produced

32
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,558
now for the fertilizers here i've tried

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,840
to provide kind of

34
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,599
there's a link in the description to

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,359
where i got the source from but the

36
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,280
typical npk analysis

37
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,560
the time to release the pros cons as

38
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,680
well as application rate that's

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,079
recommended

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,240
now blood meal is uh 12 0 0 i've also

41
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,560
seen it's 13 sometimes zero zero

42
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,599
but it's basically all nitrogen with

43
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,759
little or no

44
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,959
amount of phosphorous or potassium so

45
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,519
again that's a great thing

46
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,478
it can be on the more expensive side as

47
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,399
you're looking for

48
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,239
a pound of nitrogen to dollar amount

49
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,799
just keep that in mind

50
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,759
then we get into different types of fish

51
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
fertilizer

52
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,759
so there's fish emulsion there's

53
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,000
hydraulicized liquid fish there's fish

54
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,118
meal there's fish powder there's a whole

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,478
bunch of different ones here and i'll

56
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,399
kind of break these

57
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,478
down so you can understand that while

58
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,118
fish fertilizer is one general category

59
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,118
there's a couple other more specifics so

60
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,280
start with the first one fish emulsion

61
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,759
well what fish emulsion is is kind of

62
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,000
the infamous for its foul smell

63
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,319
emulsions are soluble liquid fertilizers

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,879
that have been heat and acid processed

65
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,559
basically from fished waste and we can

66
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,679
see again all the same information

67
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
provided here

68
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,760
you can see typical as is these are five

69
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,639
one one this listed typically is five

70
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,919
two two

71
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,759
so again when you're looking at

72
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,598
applications be mindful of what

73
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,318
particular fertilizer you might have be

74
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,359
purchased

75
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,519
yourself then the liquid fish or an

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,440
enzymatically digested fish and probably

77
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,280
of this of all the enzymatically

78
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,359
digested liquid fish products

79
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,439
neptune's harvest is probably the most

80
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,120
name most people would recognize

81
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,439
and this is a digest of the nutrients

82
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
from fish wastes instead of using heat

83
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,000
and acids

84
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,360
so enzymes are using to kind of break

85
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,360
break this process down

86
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,200
it retains more of the proteins enzymes

87
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,599
vitamins and micronutrients

88
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,238
than emulsions do this is why this is

89
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,079
typically so commonly used within

90
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
growers and you can see the typical

91
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,560
ratio compared to these a little

92
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,280
different so again

93
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,039
just mindful the product you're using do

94
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,719
a fish meal which is fish meal is

95
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,598
basically ground and heat dried fish

96
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,359
waste

97
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,878
a little more variable a little bit

98
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,560
harder sometimes to kind of

99
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,239
mix with water though it is water

100
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
soluble may take a little warm water a

101
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,560
little more agitation to get that into

102
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,959
solution

103
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,318
so you can be utilized and given to your

104
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,800
plants

105
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,679
doing it to fish powder which fish

106
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,360
powder is

107
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,760
dried with heat and turned into water

108
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,680
soluble powdered form

109
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,280
its high source of nitrogen can be mixed

110
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,159
into solution and injected to an

111
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,239
irrigation system however while fish

112
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,079
powder is supposedly able to be injected

113
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,439
into the irrigation system if you are

114
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,360
going to be utilizing that

115
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,560
make sure you have a filter because some

116
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
fish powders are

117
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
more soluble than others and some may be

118
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,079
too

119
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
large of particles and may clog drip

120
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,959
emitter lines for example

121
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,959
so be sure you have that filter to

122
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,000
protect yourself so your fish powder

123
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,039
doesn't go through and clog

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,318
all your potential irrigation lines then

125
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,639
we get into bat guano

126
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,238
so baguano or feces harvested from caves

127
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,479
and is a

128
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,599
kind of a power powerful powdered

129
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,359
product

130
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,359
the powder can be applied directly to

131
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,959
the soil or mixed with water so it can

132
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,799
be applied in irrigation water

133
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,400
for delivery to the plants again make

134
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,760
sure you have a filter there

135
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,158
so you're preventing any clogging of any

136
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,280
drip lines and again also looking at you

137
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,158
know the past fertilizer with

138
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,360
the fish here fish meal keep in mind

139
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,839
there are potassium

140
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,959
and phosphorous numbers as well we see

141
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,798
that also with the

142
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,160
bat wanna keep mine there is cost

143
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,359
associated with background can be on the

144
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,720
more expensive side

145
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,520
you also have to think about the carbon

146
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,120
footprint it took to get that fertilizer

147
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:34,000
to you and then lastly we have manure

148
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,639
so for manure i can come from cows sheep

149
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,959
poultry

150
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,040
horses typically used as a soil

151
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,719
amendment contains more nitrogen

152
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
and because of this it's often used as

153
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,600
the main reason for adding manure to

154
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,240
soil

155
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
however manure's nutrient content is

156
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,400
small compared to other chemical

157
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,800
fertilizers

158
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,159
it can also help with soil structure

159
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,600
keep in mind though the nutrient values

160
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,800
will depend on the source of the animal

161
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,280
the bedding used

162
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
and the amount included so coarse

163
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,879
minerals a little different from cow

164
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,879
from sheep and poultry typically chicken

165
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,519
manure will be your most nutrient and

166
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,319
dense

167
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,839
for comparison so keep that in mind also

168
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,199
with manures if you are adding it's a

169
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,359
soil amendment that may require

170
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,720
higher amounts first year you'll get a

171
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,199
lot of nitrogen boost which would be

172
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,199
great

173
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,720
but the phosphorus and potassium can

174
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,439
reside in that soil for a number of

175
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,840
years

176
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,439
may cause you in years to come to switch

177
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,879
to a pure nitrogen source

178
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,399
because the phosphorus and nitrogen

179
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,079
sticking in that soil and getting the

180
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,679
benefits of the soil properties

181
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,959
don't keep adding manure every year

182
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,720
because your phosphorus numbers will

183
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,918
likely become in the excessive and

184
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,280
potentially toxic

185
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,279
range which could contaminate fresh

186
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,279
groundwater
