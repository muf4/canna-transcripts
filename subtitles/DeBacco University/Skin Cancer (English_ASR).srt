1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,309
here we're gonna get skin cancer related

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,778
to sunlight exposure as you can tell

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:09,750
from the title slide here I'm going to

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:12,169
try to use some real images so some of

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,699
them may be a little graphic but this is

6
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:17,160
sadly what skin cancer does look like

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:19,710
and relating it to sunlight exposure and

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,890
how that can increase your odds of sadly

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,670
getting one of these particular skin

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,199
cancers so melanin related to cancer

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,380
risk well your cancer because cancer

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,370
risk is actually inversely proportional

13
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,558
to your epidermal melanin content what

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,718
does this mean well if you notice here

15
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,459
here's our melon content increasing so

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,120
our epidermal melanin content is

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,340
increasing as we get darker skin and our

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,820
cancerous down here is actually becoming

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,460
less and less inversely proportional as

20
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,369
melanin increases cancer risk will

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,649
decrease so if you view the darker skin

22
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,468
types you'll have more melanin and that

23
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,600
can reduce your skin can service at

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,320
least related to sunlight so we call

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,609
this inversely proportional here now

26
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,408
sunlight in skin cancer so there's

27
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:12,719
different types of skin cancer well it's

28
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,859
the broad category and see there's many

29
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:19,739
different types of actual skin cancers

30
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:21,810
that's what skin cancer is in all these

31
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,269
cases it's uncontrolled growth of

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,150
abnormal skin cells it occurs when

33
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,578
unrepaired DNA is damaged in the skin

34
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,700
cells you see here often from UV

35
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,228
radiation which can be from sunshine

36
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,450
sunlight or also tanning beds can also

37
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,209
produce high amounts of this UV

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,189
radiation this can trigger mutations and

39
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:44,158
unique defects that can then lead to

40
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:47,129
skin cells to multiply rapidly and form

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,618
malignant tumors so again many different

42
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,379
types here have some more rarer than

43
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,509
others and some very deadly compared to

44
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,810
others so it's very important to just

45
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,810
keep an eye out you can still look at

46
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,009
your skin and if you notice any of these

47
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,079
or something that looks like these

48
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,959
starting to form to contact someone

49
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,929
immediately so again your sis

50
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,060
comparisons effects of UV radiation

51
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,949
works are benign and not cancerous your

52
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,439
skin growths that appear when a virus

53
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,209
affects the top layer of skin so we

54
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,818
asked why don't include images of warts

55
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,860
here on the particular looks like a

56
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:25,619
finger here or literally can occur on

57
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,569
the eyelid well these are often miss

58
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,480
they're confused with skin cancer

59
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:31,589
they're benign they're not cancerous and

60
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,060
they're just skin growths that appear

61
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,180
when a virus infects the top layer of

62
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,110
skin so again very similar in appearance

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,849
but very different in the but--'cause

64
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,099
here we have a basal cell carcinoma

65
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,049
which is abnormal uncontrolled growth

66
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,419
that arise from basal cells which are in

67
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,219
the deepest layer of the epidermis they

68
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,458
almost never spread beyond the original

69
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,389
site so that's a good thing

70
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,099
again it's not a good thing that it's

71
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,439
cancerous but they don't really spread

72
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,939
so you kind of get a look at the you

73
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,209
know try to find the positive here

74
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,310
however a melanoma here a malignant

75
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,379
melanoma in particular are aggressive in

76
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,239
life threatening the skin cancer they

77
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,879
have a very high tendency to spread an

78
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,830
early detection is very important for

79
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,409
these so that effective controls can be

80
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:20,070
put in place to limit the chance of it's

81
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:21,750
reading or becoming life threatening so

82
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,590
what do you look for for skin cancer

83
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,870
well as the ABCD here asymmetry so if

84
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,469
it's asymmetrical does half doesn't look

85
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,709
like the other

86
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:33,539
that's one red flag B is for border

87
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,370
irregular edges or blurry or sketchy

88
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,979
chicken eyes is that irregular border

89
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,709
region the color is either varied or

90
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:42,899
inconsistent could be brown black

91
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,370
regions diameter is bigger than the size

92
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,129
of a pencil it is approximately six

93
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,549
millimeters and then the evolution any

94
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:52,560
mole that changes over time so what I

95
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,120
kind of put up here when I found just

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,340
graters links in the description to some

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,159
of these is this would be kind of normal

98
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,259
it should be cancerous so it's kind of

99
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,729
comparing to that what one would

100
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,620
normally kind of look like when we look

101
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:06,479
at color it's very consistent in the

102
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,909
normal but in the cancerous one you

103
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,828
could see two different regions here for

104
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:13,500
the border very even border here and a

105
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,269
very kind of choppy a lot of kind of

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,668
Finnish Peninsula located here for the

107
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,769
cancerous one so again it's important to

108
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,358
kind of that comparison but you can see

109
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,019
just even from these images the high

110
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,279
degree of variability so when in doubt

111
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:27,779
speak an appointment with a doctor or

112
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,939
dermatologist

113
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,349
and be able to get it checked out so

114
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,629
that you can determine whether you're in

115
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,340
that normal category or if you B should

116
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:37,800
be concerned if you're in that cancerous

117
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:40,679
category key part with this and many

118
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,540
things is prevention simply reducing

119
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,129
your UV light exposure so use the

120
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,910
sunscreen or just a physical barrier

121
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:50,370
such as clothing can be help you down

122
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,590
the road stop accumulating potentially

123
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,819
mutations in your DNA and reduce your

124
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:55,819
total skin cancer risk
