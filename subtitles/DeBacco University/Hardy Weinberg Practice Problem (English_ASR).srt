1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:04,139
all right here I'm gonna go over a

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,759
hardy-weinberg practice problem this

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:07,469
will hopefully clear up any issues you

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,210
might be having they'll give you an

5
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:10,650
example and work it through so you can

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,099
understand the process that you go

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,469
through

8
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,359
remember don't practice until you get it

9
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,669
right practice until you can't get it

10
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,469
wrong so review this as many times as

11
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,900
you need to and hopefully this will be

12
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:24,719
overall helpful with you understanding

13
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,118
the process so Hardy Weinberg problem

14
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,948
down here remember this is our equation

15
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:29,759
Lu constantly be doing that this would

16
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,260
be constant

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,539
you're welcome use your calculator to

18
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,280
help yourself work work through this

19
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,170
problem

20
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,808
so given a population of 100 individuals

21
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,960
remember diploid individuals of 200

22
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:47,280
total alleles 16 exhibit a recessive

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,160
trait so the problem is to finally

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,859
allele frequencies for big a in little a

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,019
and find the genotype frequencies for

26
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,988
the homozygous dominant the heterozygous

27
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,910
and the homozygous recessive this is all

28
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:02,459
you would be given and you'd be expected

29
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,988
to find these answers in this feed I'm

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,689
going to go through this step process

31
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:09,298
the points process to help you gain some

32
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,798
experience so the allele frequencies we

33
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,549
want to calculate first how can I go

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,580
about doing that

35
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,920
well P plus Q equals 1 and since P

36
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,408
equals a big a and Q goes away then we

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,990
can simply say big a plus la will equal

38
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:28,618
1 so the question is something out of

39
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:30,449
200 plus 32 to 200 will equal 200 at 200

40
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,670
you need to work with the total allele

41
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,189
so we're the number 200 come from that

42
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,769
was the total alleles where did the 32

43
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:40,709
come from well the 16 that exhibits the

44
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:43,140
recessive trait mean that they're these

45
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:47,969
individuals here through the homozygous

46
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,560
recessive so 16 times 2 is the 32 so if

47
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:51,509
this equals the 16 percent then

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,719
something plus 16 percent has to equal

49
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:59,509
hundred percent which means 84 percent

50
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:02,609
because 84 plus 16 is 184 percent are a

51
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:05,879
combination of the homozygous dominant

52
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:07,920
and the heterozygotes now in order to

53
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,899
calculate what the almost I guess

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,449
dominant and the heterozygotes are and

55
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,439
to take this the next step further so 16

56
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:16,069
percent and

57
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:20,250
full form is represented by 0.16 and

58
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:23,370
this is the same as Q squared those are

59
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,780
two little A's or q q or q squared a

60
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,409
representative right here remember

61
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,020
that's our recessive or 0.16 we simply

62
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:34,740
take the square root of that to get Q

63
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,700
which is point four now this one's point

64
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:42,600
four we know 1 minus Q equals P or 1

65
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:45,899
minus 0.4 is 0.6 so the dominant allele

66
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:49,500
here is represented by 0.6 and the

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,480
recessive allele by 0.4 this is a big

68
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,000
help because now we can start to input

69
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:59,009
this into our equation and help answer

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,620
the genotype frequencies so the

71
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:04,229
phenotype frequencies if P equals 0.6 in

72
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,770
cused 0.4 then we simply plug into the

73
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:11,189
equation P squared is 0.6 times 0.6

74
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,469
which is your 0.36 Q squared is 0.4

75
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:16,530
times 0.4 just point one six and the

76
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:18,689
heterozygotes - PQ two times 0.6 times

77
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,989
points point four eight what these

78
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:24,680
decimals refer to is the homozygous

79
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,539
dominant represent 36% of the population

80
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,830
the heterozygous dominant is 48 percent

81
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:34,979
and recessive is 16% hopefully this is

82
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,110
helpful going through an example here to

83
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:40,709
help you understand how to calculate the

84
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,850
hardy-weinberg equation and to test your

85
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,959
knowledge here is another question here

86
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,729
Fraggles are mythical mouse-like

87
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,310
creatures that live beneath flower

88
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:54,060
gardens if a hundred Fraggles in a

89
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,219
population of 100,000 of population 91

90
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,879
have green hair we're going to represent

91
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:02,069
with capital F and nine have gray hair

92
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,569
lowercase a' assume in june at

93
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,609
equilibrium what are the gene

94
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,650
frequencies of big f and little F and

95
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,470
one of the genotypic frequencies I

96
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,489
invite you to pause the video here so

97
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:13,560
you can go through and work this problem

98
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:18,030
on your own before I proceed with the

99
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,649
answers all right we're going to proceed

100
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:22,168
now with the answers hopefully you can

101
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,139
compare your own to the answers that I

102
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:28,228
have presented here so the answers are

103
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,839
simple F is a point

104
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:32,818
little F is 0.3 and going through our

105
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,589
hardy-weinberg equation as you can find

106
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,960
at the beginning of this video the

107
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:39,478
homozygous dominant it's 49% the

108
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:43,799
heterozygous is 42% and the homozygous

109
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:45,449
recessive is 9% this is another

110
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,550
graphical representation to help you

111
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,810
work through the problem and kind of

112
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,069
shows it with the punnett square if that

113
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,470
helps you understand that a little bit

114
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:55,348
better but invite you to go back and

115
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,180
review this video so you can be a feel

116
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:59,750
comfortable calculating with the

117
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,750
hardy-weinberg equation
