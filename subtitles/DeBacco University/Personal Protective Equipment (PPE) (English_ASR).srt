1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,299
now while this will be a very short

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,400
summary here of personal protective

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:08,490
equipment or PPE those worth a

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,320
standalone video lecture here the sense

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,419
that PPE is typically see that

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,750
abbreviation or looking at pesticide

7
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,519
applications say how the proper PPE now

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,980
it's answer a personal protective

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:24,028
equipment you can see some examples of

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,679
that here now PPE these equipment is

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,800
designed to protect the individual from

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,259
injury or infection also keeping the

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,480
person or the applicator separate from

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,700
whatever they're applying now the exact

15
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,369
form of equipment used is determined by

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,460
the situation in the individual will be

17
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:44,128
facing typically though you'll see some

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,950
sort of head covering you'll see long

19
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:49,589
sleeves long pants boots and typically a

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,840
respirator involved with why I say the

21
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,250
exact form others different respirators

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,260
for different types of products some are

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,429
dis particulate respirators some might

24
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:01,530
be too specific chemicals that might be

25
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:03,960
evident here of the person making the

26
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,849
application so just understand that PPE

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,099
common abbreviation used personal

28
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:10,079
protection equipment and when you're

29
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,599
reading the label on a pesticide be

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,819
mindful of what they recommend and make

31
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:18,469
sure you have that on hand to separate

32
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,469
yourself from what you're applying
