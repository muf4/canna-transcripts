1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,480
okay so here we're looking at

2
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:05,789
micronutrients sometimes called trace

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,589
elements given by micronutrients are

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,320
essential for plant growth but just

5
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,330
needed in small amounts so starting with

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,759
the first one here boron represented by

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,039
letter B this helps in the use of

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,219
nutrients and regulates other nutrients

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,500
also an example would be calcium so

10
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,599
calcium and boron levels are often

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,160
compared to one another because they can

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,320
burn can influence the amount of

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,719
availability of calcium it's essential

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,859
for seed and fruit development

15
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:33,509
deficiencies are encouraged if plants

16
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,870
are water stressed in the admit II is

17
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:39,449
very low also if sole or media calcium

18
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,009
levels are low for X or boric acid are

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,079
common sources of boron if you're

20
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:46,769
looking at supplementing them to your

21
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,200
plants chloride is often considered to

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,870
be a soil contaminant levels this is

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,730
true Gloria though is needed by plants

24
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:55,829
it's kind of considered a soil

25
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,988
contaminants it's a negative ion they

26
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,698
kind of influence some of the

27
00:00:56,988 --> 00:01:01,169
availability of some cations but it is

28
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,329
needed at least in these kind of

29
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,100
micronutrient amounts because it's

30
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,769
important to help regulate the stomata

31
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,149
which are areas below the leaves that

32
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:11,579
help air come in and out and also

33
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,260
regulate water and it helps the plant

34
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,420
balance its interaction with the

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,340
environment it's also necessary for the

36
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,469
photosynthetic process to allow that to

37
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,320
function properly so again in these high

38
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:24,170
amounts not the best thing but is needed

39
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,489
in some amounts by the planet

40
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,379
copper's another one it's required for

41
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,239
many enzymatic activities and plants and

42
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,060
for chlorophyll and seed production all

43
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,739
very vital tasks at the plant most

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,629
common cause for a Division sees at pH

45
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,728
imbalance and not a lack of copper in

46
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:40,438
the media this is again why I stress

47
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:42,659
that it's important to be monitoring and

48
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,339
knowing what your pH is because this is

49
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,409
one micronutrient particular that can be

50
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,780
drastically affected by swings in pH

51
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,549
when it's they pay a special attention

52
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,040
to the leaves around the buds or tips

53
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,659
from that are turning yellow and lower

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,430
parts of the leaves getting a darker

55
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,609
than normal green color this can be

56
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,140
evidence of a copper deficiency that's

57
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:02,879
of concern for cannabis in particular

58
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,739
because it can stunt blood formation if

59
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,078
you stunt blood formation that's kind of

60
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,699
where all the main driving cannabinoid

61
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:10,560
production is and if that gets stunted

62
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,789
because of low copper that can really

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,789
impact your final harvest

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,760
to iron he represented by Effie it's

65
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,010
involving the formation of enzymes and

66
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,539
chlorophyll leaves will yellow if

67
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,489
deficient but will typically be the

68
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:26,819
upper leaves not the lower ones like

69
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,710
nitrogen or a magnesium deficiency this

70
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,000
is kind of a citrus plant kind of get

71
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,520
the idea that's the upper leaves that

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,409
are yellowing iron typically used you

73
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,780
know a lot in greenhouses and for

74
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:38,639
structural support but it is also a

75
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,560
nutrient it's a common problem with

76
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,219
cocoa cars simply because of some of the

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,509
properties of this particular media

78
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:47,400
manganese again not to being confused

79
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:49,620
with mag in the magnesium this is

80
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,000
manganese represent by M and punctured

81
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,890
with enzyme systems involved with

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,770
breakdown of carbohydrates nitrogen

83
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:58,379
metabolism and post services see here's

84
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,330
eye fertilizer here Crick's the Frizzle

85
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,840
leaf in palms so commonly a palm tree

86
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,590
fertilizer for whatever reason but it is

87
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,030
manganese is needed by all plants here

88
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,620
molybdenum is needed in such small

89
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,409
amounts it's very unlikely to be the

90
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,750
case of a deficiency in most instances

91
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:17,340
if growing in purely hydroponic

92
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,409
situation there may be a chance of this

93
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,769
occurring but many fertilizer contains

94
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:25,199
some level of molybdenum and it's not in

95
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,760
large amounts I have the picture here of

96
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,699
a thimble because it's like to grow an

97
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,530
acre of corn need like a thimble full

98
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,119
amount of melindam for the entire acre

99
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,250
so again when I say small wants very

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,289
small amounts well this is what the

101
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,530
actual element looks like the fertilizer

102
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:43,679
form is not the pure element it'd be in

103
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,300
a molecule complex so last one we look

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,530
at here is zinc it's not a common

105
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,969
occurrence in cannabis

106
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,269
but where does occur it can be a major

107
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:52,800
issue it's not very mobile so you're

108
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,450
likely to find the symptoms show up in

109
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,280
newer growth doesn't really translocate

110
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,679
through the plant very well because of

111
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,569
this give me an issue if you're cloning

112
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,780
a plant since the cutting is taken

113
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,489
towards the end the plant may this zinc

114
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,610
may have a hard time getting there so if

115
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,590
you take a recent clones and they all

116
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,570
turn yellow fairly quickly there's a

117
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,280
chance you could be zinc deficient in

118
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,689
the plant and I mentioned this just

119
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,639
because if you're looking at kind of

120
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,629
feeding the picky mother plants you want

121
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,478
to make sure that they're healthy

122
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:23,038
if dink is an issue in the media you've

123
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,089
been growing in something to keep in

124
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:24,919
mind especially if you're looking to

125
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,529
clone that

126
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,090
here you'll be removing that tip and you

127
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:31,729
want to make sure that it maintains a

128
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:34,639
nice green coloration so they can absorb

129
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,560
light and produce quality roots and

130
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,569
allow you to have the next generation

131
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,220
so again when it's not a major concern

132
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:43,930
but we haven't problems with your clones

133
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,930
one you may want to investigate
