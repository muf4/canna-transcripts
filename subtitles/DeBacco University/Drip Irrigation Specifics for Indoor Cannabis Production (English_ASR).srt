00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,650
looking at drip irrigation specifics for

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:14,719
indoor cannabis production

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:16,480
[Music]

5
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,839
so as the image shows here here's some

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,640
canvas plants growing and they're

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,320
using a drip style irrigation system so

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,719
let's talk about some of the specifics

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,518
associated with this type of system

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,320
so first off the general basics of this

11
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,038
system

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,960
well drip lines are basically used and

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,399
with tubing as we can see going right

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,480
down the line right here

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,920
and its goal is to precisely deliver

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,599
water to the plants

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,320
and precisely deliver water plants in a

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,280
very even and consistent manner as well

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
this is often done with low pressure and

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,640
regulators

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,520
to ensure consistency even in a large

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,840
operation

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,359
as we see in the image here timers are

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,160
typically incorporated to allow for

25
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,159
automation

26
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,640
as well as potential for water sensors

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,479
to again help maintain consistency

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,960
amongst all the plants

29
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,798
now the advantages of drip irrigation

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,280
are that there's water savings

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
simply due to less waste there's also

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,519
reduced fertilizer loss to the precision

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
of delivery of to individual plants

34
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,519
and also the ability to automate to

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,399
allow for consistent conditions for the

36
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,640
plants

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
it's very easy to maintain a drip

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,159
irrigation system

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,519
and it also has a long life expectancy

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,200
of its components

41
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,798
so for all these reasons this is why

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,920
drip irrigation is

43
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,600
a system that's used by many growers

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
however there are some challenges with

45
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,640
any system and drip irrigation is no

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,400
different

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,560
so there's potential for salt

48
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,960
accumulation due to lack of waste or

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,079
leaching water there could be clogging

50
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,839
within the system

51
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,759
filters are not put in place or the

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,478
filters themselves could clog

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,439
if they're not checked leaks can also

54
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,078
often have

55
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,679
many fittings so be sure you're checking

56
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,359
the system for those leaks

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,799
and checking the system regularly should

58
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,799
be done in general

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,320
there's also a need for specific parts

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,920
and extras to allow for quick

61
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,279
replacements so there are some drip

62
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,680
irrigation specific

63
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
components that need to be purchased and

64
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,719
also purchased with a little extra

65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,719
in case something was to break or fail

66
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,560
the equipment required so in general

67
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,919
we're looking at a

68
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,000
drip system drip spikes transfer tubing

69
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,679
main lines fertilizer injector timers

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,878
valves filters pressure regulators and

71
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,560
connecting fittings

72
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,318
now looking at this list it does look

73
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,920
like it's quite extensive

74
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,919
but a lot of these things come together

75
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,479
as a kit a lot of them

76
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,518
are just long lasting components that

77
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,560
don't necessarily

78
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,680
need continual replacement now drip

79
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,039
irrigation versus

80
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,200
hand watering why would someone choose

81
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,878
one versus the other well both deliver

82
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,039
specific amounts of water to the plants

83
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,318
individually hand warning requires daily

84
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,560
labor to accomplish this

85
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,359
drip irrigation can drastically reduce

86
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,400
the day-to-day

87
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,239
time spent accomplishing this same task

88
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,159
also since it can be automated the drip

89
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,878
irrigation it's easy for growers to

90
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,560
decide

91
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,919
to go with multiple watering events in a

92
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,439
day if it's needed

93
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,039
since it'll just be a quick program

94
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,800
change instead of going through and

95
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,799
watering the plants once a day

96
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,840
doing pulse irrigation might be

97
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,800
advantageous

98
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,800
and the drip irrigation is a system that

99
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,920
allows for minimal loss and allows this

100
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,000
to be very easily done especially if

101
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,119
timers are incorporated into the drip

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,878
irrigation

103
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,878
system for your cannabis plants
