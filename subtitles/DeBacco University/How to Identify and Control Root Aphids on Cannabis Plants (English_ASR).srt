1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,240
on this tobacco university video we're

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
going to be looking at

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,320
root aphids so while we may be familiar

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,240
with aphids that typically are seen

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
affecting the leaves and the stems

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,919
can't also forget about these root

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,079
aphids which can also

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,079
negatively impact your cannabis plants

9
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:26,399
[Music]

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,640
so here we're going to be looking at

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,640
root aphids something we might be more

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,640
familiar with in the top growth of the

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,399
the plant but they also can affect the

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,119
lower portions so how do we identify and

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,679
control them

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,039
on our cannabis plants well first off

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,238
the right through aphid is what's going

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,079
to be focused on

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,759
this is a dark green insect with

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
generally around body form

21
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,960
so wingless stages develop on roots and

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,719
they survive on plants

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,719
the wing stages periodically emerge from

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,320
the soil and they fly to new places

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,920
new plants and that's how they're able

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
to spread their infection

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,198
they do have a wide host range including

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,440
indoor cannabis plants

29
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,479
even when grown hydroponically so just

30
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,000
don't think because you're not growing

31
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,839
in a solid substrate you don't have to

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,760
worry about root aphids even hydroponic

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,560
growers should be mindful of this

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,640
threat root aphids identification and

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,560
the plant damage so

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
at 73 degrees fahrenheit and optimum

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,159
temperature rice fruit aphids can

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,159
populations can double every 1.6 days

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,840
so they can go very quickly here we can

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,560
see what they look like

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,478
at the kind of wingless root aphids at

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,600
the base of a plant here we see the

43
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,400
winged

44
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,438
rice root aphids trapped on a cannabis

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,200
leaf here

46
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,719
then we have them developing within a

47
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,320
hydroponic system so we can see the

48
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,359
roots and we do see them identified

49
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,679
right here

50
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,719
and then within the soil of the rice

51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,600
plant like here

52
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,879
and here these rice fruit aphids i

53
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,039
should say the cannabis plant

54
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,319
appeared in the lighter and lower

55
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,799
portion of the picture

56
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,118
which can be difficult initially to see

57
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,200
and do require that attention to detail

58
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,319
this is also kind of highlighted here

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,960
what they look like

60
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,959
kind of mixed in with the substrate that

61
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,319
the cannabis plants are growing in

62
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,839
so again identification clearly evident

63
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,599
but can be a little more difficult

64
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,239
because of their size so careful

65
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,000
inspection and scouting is important

66
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,439
so i had to go about managing them if

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
you do identify them

68
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,598
well root aphid management is especially

69
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,598
challenging in organic systems

70
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,280
study was conducted at least in celery

71
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,000
so it's something to evaluate the

72
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,000
effectiveness

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,919
of certain products applied via drip

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,439
irrigation drench

75
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,839
evaluations were pre-treatment

76
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,120
post-treatment 1 which is application 13

77
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
days after the treatment

78
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
and post applica post 2 application 10

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,159
days after the first treatment

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
let's take a look at their data so this

81
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,280
was

82
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,840
their results and they determined that

83
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,000
when

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,759
the overall change in aphid populations

85
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
after both applications compared to the

86
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,439
pre-treatment numbers was considered

87
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,280
there was and we can see the results

88
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,199
here untreated over here

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,959
three percent reduction in untreated

90
00:02:53,199 --> 00:03:05,839
control 24 18 and 129

91
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:05,840
increase in

92
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,359
so let's look at their data well these

93
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,919
were the results and when the overall

94
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,360
change in aphid populations after both

95
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,280
applications compared

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,040
to the pre-treatment numbers were

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,878
considered there was a three percent

98
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,400
reduction in untreated controls we see

99
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,598
those listed right here

100
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
24 18 and 29 percent increase in

101
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,039
these three listed products uh

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,560
respectively however

103
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,759
milotrol oh along with uh as a guard

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,920
provided 62

105
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,079
reduction in aid populations followed by

106
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,199
a 29 percent reduction in grandivo

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,400
and 24 by then or eight this study

108
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,719
demonstrates the potential for

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,519
non-chemical options when managing aphid

110
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,719
populations

111
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,319
at least in organic celery these

112
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,079
microbial pesticides especially in

113
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,599
combination with botanical pesticides

114
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,400
can play a significant role in pest

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,840
management

116
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,599
understanding the modes of action and

117
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,119
different options and using the right

118
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
combinations is critical

119
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,800
to pest management decisions so trying

120
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,240
to find data like this

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
well not in cannabis can at least

122
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,840
provide a good starting point

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,918
and for all the products we see again

124
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,679
the first one is the pre-treatment

125
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,198
post-treatment one and post-treatment

126
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,918
two looking at

127
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,919
mean number of aphids per plant we can

128
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,680
see how the changes occurred again

129
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,000
utilizing a combination

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
definitely showed a pretty significant

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,240
here

132
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,919
reduction so again worth considering and

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
at least a starting point if you're

134
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,319
looking at what products

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
may be effective if you do identify root

136
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,800
aphids

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,800
in your cannabis crops
