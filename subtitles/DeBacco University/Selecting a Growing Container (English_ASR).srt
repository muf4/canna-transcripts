1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,680
now there are many different types of

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,469
containers when growing on selecting the

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,969
right one is important how do you go

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:10,740
about looking at the options that are

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,710
there and how you go about selecting the

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,150
right one for your situation well

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,560
there's many factors that come into play

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,410
as we see here looking at many different

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,969
colors for you want to consider what

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,879
else is in the room what sizes of the

11
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,829
room one of the other room colors just

12
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,750
the same thing comes in when it's a

13
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,879
latina container want to be thinking

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,668
about what type of plants we grow in

15
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:34,200
what size are they going to be what are

16
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,578
we looking at for convenience but

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,460
there's a cost with its availability

18
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,600
what's the size the shape the color

19
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,969
staging plants material and are we

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,649
growing in large beds so again all these

21
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,000
things come into play

22
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,590
this is why it's simply a little bit

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,170
more complex you may have originally

24
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,879
thought how the material is the first

25
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,039
thing to consider while the plant may

26
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,019
not being direct directly affected by

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,969
the material material that the container

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,289
is made out of to have many different

29
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,840
types and different properties

30
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,698
associated with that clay pots are kind

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,260
of the old old standard they're very

32
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,539
heavy they will wick moisture away

33
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,159
increasing the need for irrigation as a

34
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,350
result these are rarely used in

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,490
large-scale production anymore metal

36
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:15,539
pots can corrode over time wooden pots

37
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:17,699
sadly with wooden pots they can break

38
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,770
down over time or degrade they can also

39
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,140
Harbor disease and when used for

40
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,179
multiple cropping cycles as a result the

41
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,250
main focus here and most popular of

42
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,200
course is plastic pots due to their

43
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,180
lightweight ease of storage long life in

44
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,159
reduced moisture loss as a result this

45
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,320
will be the main focus of the discussion

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,479
from here on they have rigid and grow

47
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,039
bags both polymer the plastic category

48
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,500
just went to me to where of some of the

49
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,380
other pots but plastic by far is going

50
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,819
to be the main focus here so convenience

51
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:46,589
some growers use what they can easily

52
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,169
find out what's on the shelf what do I

53
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,780
have some extras of sometimes this is

54
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,000
what's free or what what they can wash

55
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,280
and clean the containers before use

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,950
however this leads to issues with

57
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,750
consistency having different pot sizes

58
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,359
and different shape pots reduce your

59
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,069
efficiency so overall cost savings is

60
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,349
minimal give the example if you have a

61
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:08,639
very small pot in a very large pot and

62
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:10,378
you're both trying to grow plant in

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,598
those they have very different watering

64
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,739
requirements you could miss one need to

65
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,209
overwater one

66
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,670
and this creates just that lack of

67
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,560
consistency that lack of efficiency in

68
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,688
your grow operation we also wanna be

69
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,949
looking at the cost of the container and

70
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:25,019
while the cost will depend on many

71
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,518
factors typically the thickness and size

72
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,099
of the containers are typically the

73
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,009
driving force behind the cost we can

74
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:34,139
reuse plastic pots after good rinse and

75
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,449
wash down so this can vastly impact your

76
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:39,000
long-term container budget if you're

77
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:40,530
able to reuse those keep in mind also

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,469
the cost of shipping when comparing

79
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,060
containers some people cause with a free

80
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:46,680
shipping sum if you order over a certain

81
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,348
amount so you want to keep the shipping

82
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,629
cost is also a factor in the total cost

83
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:52,858
of that container so you can see there's

84
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:54,298
a lot of little different puzzle pieces

85
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:56,099
when it comes to putting together the

86
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,870
final cost but all these must be

87
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:00,839
considered so you get the true accurate

88
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,239
assessment of the final cost the

89
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,680
availability what can you get now a lot

90
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,628
of girls kind of wait to the last minute

91
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,849
and then want to buy something and that

92
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:10,169
can run into some issues however you

93
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:12,149
should select a container that is the

94
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,488
best fit for your growing operation not

95
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,500
just what you can get now do not change

96
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:17,819
this because the one pot or the one

97
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,219
container that you're looking for is

98
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:23,458
backordered that's often back toward for

99
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,259
reasons difficult part and you want to

100
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,000
plan your grow around that just want to

101
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,128
do that ones backward I'll just go with

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,318
this one and I'll have a run of those

103
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:32,789
size pots or those type of pots again

104
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,589
keeping everything efficient keeping

105
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:36,539
everything consistent is very important

106
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,489
and get away from just kind of ordering

107
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,858
late and getting what is available now

108
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,349
and if backward or just a little bit it

109
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:45,439
potentially worth the wait to keep your

110
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,728
a grow operation efficient as possible

111
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,590
this size of the container so size

112
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,900
doesn't part relate to the age of the

113
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,840
plant most growers will simplify and use

114
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,370
three main sizes small pots at 4 inches

115
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,919
to one gallon are typically used for

116
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,599
clones medium pots are considered about

117
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,790
3 gallons and therefore the early part

118
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,459
with a vegetative stage then when you

119
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:07,679
transplant into flowering or into final

120
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,209
stages 5 to 10 gallon pots are for the

121
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,519
main grow and flower and phase to

122
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,169
maximize yields most girls are using

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,168
about 7 and 10 gallon pots some may even

124
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,370
go larger for mother plants somebody

125
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,848
believes 10 gallons or sometimes even

126
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,918
larger pots for that instance container

127
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:25,860
shape so taller pots are preferred over

128
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,000
wider window garden style containers so

129
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,220
kind of 100 pots

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,740
be taller and thinner than kind of this

131
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,620
long appearance here this allows to

132
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,340
easily pack in more plants under art

133
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,139
sometimes limited lighting area

134
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:42,239
container color so there are a lot of

135
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,339
theories or ideas behind color typically

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,240
white will be little less likely to

137
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,429
absorb heat

138
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,829
however standard black pot is by far the

139
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,990
most widely used some girls want to try

140
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:53,759
reds or blues because it increased gross

141
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,180
has been shown in reports with like

142
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,800
tomatoes or squash but this day is based

143
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,199
on plastic mulch and outdoor growing

144
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,240
situations as we see here these

145
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,829
containers do not really reflect that

146
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,050
much light to the plant canopy that's

147
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:08,639
why color doesn't matter that much here

148
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,020
in the outdoor grow situation we see the

149
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,849
sunlight coming down reflecting this

150
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,829
large area of light up at the plant

151
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,050
looking down at the light that may hit

152
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:18,180
the pot and reflect it up to the plant

153
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,379
well it's just basically the rim so that

154
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,050
color is going to have a very minimal

155
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,339
impact on the plant growth so even

156
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,439
though color can potentially have an

157
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,569
impact on large field growing operations

158
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,689
and plastic mulches container growing

159
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:32,819
the area is greatly reduced in much at

160
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:35,399
minimal so color is by far least

161
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,990
important here if you're growing in

162
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,539
large bed some girls choose to grow in

163
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,340
large beds here like the big boxes

164
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,530
filled with media or multiple plants may

165
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,299
be grown initially this may sound easier

166
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,339
than many of these little pots to move

167
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,079
around but the this design typically

168
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,489
wastes a lot of soil and you're

169
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:52,918
constantly changing after each grow

170
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,199
cycle it can be a lot of a greater

171
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,819
challenge here so typically raised beds

172
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,529
are not advised growing plants

173
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:01,439
individually in pots is the preferred

174
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:04,379
method to go with plastic pots that's

175
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,910
the by far the most efficient way so you

176
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,519
want to keep that in mind to keep your

177
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,290
grow operation as efficient and easy to

178
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,289
easy to maintain as possible
