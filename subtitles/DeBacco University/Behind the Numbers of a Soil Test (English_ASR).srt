1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,958
okay Herman take a brief look behind the

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,490
numbers of a soil test so we get these

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,349
numbers back printed out and report

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,809
after we sent our soil those kind of

5
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:12,449
numbers mean and how does a lot go about

6
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,428
getting some of those so the objective

7
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,618
of a soil test is to estimate the amount

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,570
of plant available nutrients now keep in

9
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,210
mind this is different this is not the

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,939
total amount of nutrients as a result

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,039
soil test labs using the extraction

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,920
fluid to simulate the plant's ability to

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,868
remove nutrients from the soil so the

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,450
goal is we want to get the ones at the

15
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:36,479
plant can easily access if they're tied

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,579
up and locked up we don't assess those

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,349
in the soil report would be a different

18
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,420
test if you want the total amount of

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,829
potassium in your soil because that

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,420
would assess the amount that's locked up

21
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,009
as we would call it we want the ones

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,469
that are easy to get by the plant and as

23
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:51,599
a result extraction floors or what's

24
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,820
used to try to estimate what a plant can

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,070
pull out of that particular soil sample

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,689
so this extraction employed well there's

27
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,250
different extraction fluids and this can

28
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,769
result in a different estimate estimate

29
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,988
of soil nutrient supply the appropriate

30
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,118
soil test method for a given region are

31
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:08,399
selected based on cell characteristics

32
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,019
and climate just as for example the

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,659
extraction fluids going to try to wring

34
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,819
out the nutrients in that soil now if

35
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,950
we're in a soil here where we're very

36
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,419
sand the environment may be using a

37
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,430
different extraction fluid than one

38
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,379
that's here with higher organic matter

39
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,680
so again they're gonna be based on the

40
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,000
region so typically if you're testing

41
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,799
soil you want to look at what a local

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,509
lab is using for extraction fluid

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,979
however there can be differences in

44
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,129
extraction foot so there's two main

45
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,478
extraction foods used in New England

46
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:38,609
most commonly a weak acid modified

47
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,650
morgan extract in the strong male at

48
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:42,179
three extract only the University of New

49
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,790
Hampshire that uses the male at three

50
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,409
these are both the universal extraction

51
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,170
procedures meaning that they use

52
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,689
different they used to determine the

53
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,359
amount of majority of the nutrients and

54
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:55,048
many micronutrients at the same time so

55
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,959
even though they are different

56
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,909
extraction fluids and once more

57
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:03,539
aggressive they both can give you kind

58
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,890
of the same idea of nutrients then

59
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,780
keeping in mind if you're comparing two

60
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,300
modified morgan extract versus a may

61
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,878
look three some nutrients may differ

62
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,510
batches because of the extraction fluid

63
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:14,509
that is used
