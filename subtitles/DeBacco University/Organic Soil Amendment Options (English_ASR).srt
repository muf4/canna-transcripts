1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
if you're looking at organic soil

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,419
amendment options such as compost manure

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,620
peat moss and coconut fiber that's

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:09,718
important to mention we are focused on

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,740
soil here these are gonna be amendments

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,018
these are things we're going to be

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,539
adding to that soil to change or modify

8
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,519
its particular properties kind of

9
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,189
amending here we're not be growing in

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,170
pure compost or pure manure now I'd use

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,448
the term organic and for this purpose

12
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,920
it's going to mean to contains carbon so

13
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,019
organic here is relating to or

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,868
containing carbon compounds charcoal

15
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:34,379
diamonds and graphite all are carbon

16
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:36,600
compounds but the method or way that

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,030
they those carbon atoms are organized

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,340
gives these three materials there are

19
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,960
different properties

20
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,030
so compost it's a term that does not

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,370
define one single amendment but rather a

22
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,590
broad classification of amendments it's

23
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,839
important ask what questions to ask if

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,640
someone has compost our one is what is

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,320
the base material so some of those

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,000
compost that's a broad term you have to

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,939
keep that in mind Campos does that

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,179
always mean the exact same thing so

29
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,280
manure and leaves are a common with the

30
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,840
compost being preferred to reduce the

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,629
likelihood of developing excessive

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,079
phosphorus in soil conditions some

33
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:15,929
people use food scraps leaves straw

34
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:18,900
grass clippings all great compounds to

35
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,210
use manure can also be composted but if

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,540
you are worried about being high in

37
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:27,559
phosphorus these would be manure based

38
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,460
compost will raise phosphorus levels

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,640
another question asked if someone as

40
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,989
compost is how old or is it aged

41
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,670
typically older is better with about

42
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:36,658
three plus years being the target for

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,519
material that has not been

44
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,780
professionally managed but to picture

45
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,879
the trimmings here to kind of give the

46
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,239
idea of time that needs to occur the old

47
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,978
books here I need that manure or in

48
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,929
compost in general needs time to age

49
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,359
needs times to break down to make those

50
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,470
nutrients plant available another

51
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,719
question asked well how it's been

52
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:56,399
prepared it's been a static pile that's

53
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,438
the easiest but takes the longest time

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,599
to produce quality compost where was it

55
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,879
actively managed this is where piles are

56
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,429
turned and this is a preferred choice if

57
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,629
you have the option when new or as I

58
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,599
mentioned before this can be a great

59
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:10,618
soil amendment when used in moderation

60
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:12,299
over adding can lead to water

61
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:15,509
contamination and poor crop yields

62
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,610
almond or contains be aware of this and

63
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:19,169
how much you're actually adding Sosua

64
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,840
Posterous actually looks like if you

65
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:24,030
over or add areas have had excessive

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,830
phosphorous and freshwater we can get

67
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,319
this kind of algae bloom as we see here

68
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,270
if you think about it it only occurs on

69
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,129
a small scale well it can actually these

70
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,590
algae blooms occur in a large scales we

71
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,870
see here with the Great Lakes areas here

72
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,539
from image from space in the amount of

73
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,759
algae blooms again indicative of high

74
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,310
levels of phosphorous runoff going into

75
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,829
this freshwater system they have horse

76
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,710
manure it's very common to be easy to

77
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,290
get manure there's many types while

78
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,240
composting process is advantageous type

79
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:56,370
of animal influence the end product so

80
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,100
in particularly horse manure here this

81
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,980
tends to have more weed seeds and it's

82
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,620
often not fully composted and broken

83
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,539
down material also be careful not only

84
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,819
it's knew where you want to consider but

85
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,259
also the bedding horse stables ten days

86
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,969
a lot of sawdust bedding which actually

87
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,590
bind up a lot of the nitrogen and could

88
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,870
cause plants to be nitrogen deficient

89
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,539
even though the manure itself may

90
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,370
contain some levels of nitrogen chicken

91
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,189
manure is the hottest which means it has

92
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,349
the most nutrient dense newer in a

93
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,209
general sense a little goes a long way

94
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:28,859
with chicken manure be careful because

95
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,900
it can have a very strong odor that is

96
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,510
very unpleasant so if you're used to

97
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,330
getting for example cow manure and apply

98
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:38,250
in a yard a cubic yard to a certain area

99
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,420
you will not want to also apply a cubic

100
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,280
yard of chicken manure because this is

101
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,099
more nutrient dense and this is what's

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,840
called hotter manure

103
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,489
cow manure as often regard is the number

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,560
one choice to the well balanced end

105
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,170
product can be as you gotten in large

106
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,810
quantities spreads pretty easy so this

107
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:56,729
is one that is very sought-after by

108
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,890
growers for modifying their field

109
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:00,060
applications

110
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:03,089
clay pellets are another kind of

111
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,590
amendment you can add to soil clay is

112
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,469
cooked under high pressure causing it to

113
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,640
expand it drains well holds roots the

114
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:10,469
combination of air and nutrient

115
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,779
solutions can be reused but should be

116
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:14,699
sterilized between usage so you can see

117
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,529
here is a plant grown in just pure clay

118
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,529
pellets may be used to help aerate

119
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:21,929
certain soil conditions here typically

120
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,119
not used on the large scale but one that

121
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,090
is commonly used so I figured I should

122
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,590
mention it for some of its advantages

123
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:30,419
peat moss is very commonly found in

124
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:32,549
media mixes it maintains water well and

125
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,740
some ability absorbed 15 to 30 times

126
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,960
it's only in water all the material

127
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,910
itself contains no nutrients for the

128
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,589
crop it can affect the nutrient

129
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,080
availability and also be a soil

130
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:45,209
acidifier typically lime is incorporated

131
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,569
and we need to added in high peat moss

132
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:51,029
base growing media due to its tendency

133
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,189
to lower the pH or make it a more acidic

134
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:54,449
environment this is the bogs and kind of

135
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:57,060
what they look like here this is what

136
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:58,800
the end product is coconut fiber is a

137
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,209
product of the chocolate industry many

138
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,579
Brewers really like coconut base

139
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:04,409
materials however quality cal-mag

140
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:07,349
supplement is needed for if grown in

141
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,120
coconut fibers it is cal-mag here it's

142
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,760
the typically the fiber that's used got

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,889
the actual shells but it's separated out

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,110
and provides this kind of growing media

145
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,550
base

146
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,199
there's a peat moss debate so we're

147
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,360
talking about peat moss coconut fiber

148
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,120
some believe well should he must be

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,949
harvested 80% of the peat moss used the

150
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,680
United States comes from Canada it's

151
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:31,589
approximately 0.2 percent of this 270

152
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,750
million acres of cane Canadian peat bogs

153
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:35,339
being used for peat mining their efforts

154
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,009
made to kind of restore this peat bogs

155
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:41,009
after their kind of harvested but some

156
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:44,039
are believing that the result may not be

157
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:46,769
as it once was in its natural state how

158
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,060
many Pekinese are aware of this and it's

159
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:49,799
a hotly debated topic and they're

160
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,839
looking at you know maintaining

161
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,610
sustainability of that you can see this

162
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,529
compressed Bale here and it is product

163
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,879
of Canada did provide this link down

164
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:59,359
here for some more information if you

165
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,740
want to look at Pete versus Coco qua

166
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,330
we're looking at those two there's no

167
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,310
clear winner between one being is say

168
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:07,560
better than the other Tomas is a more

169
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,689
consistent product and also has existing

170
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,030
microbiology Coco can be highly variable

171
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:13,740
making it hard to plan a know which are

172
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:16,049
you working with from delivery to

173
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,629
delivery so again Brewers have grown in

174
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,240
both just fine as amendments but you

175
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:26,180
want to be mindful that Coco car can be

176
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,180
highly variable one batch to another
