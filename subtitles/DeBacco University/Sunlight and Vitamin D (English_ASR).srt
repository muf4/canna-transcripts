1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:04,318
so we have probably all heard someone

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,019
saying I need to go outside and get some

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,550
sunlight to get my vitamin D well we're

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,558
gonna kind of learn about some of the

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,940
science that's behind this I think some

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,009
people do this conception that vitamin D

7
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,739
is kind of reigns from the Sun it just

8
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,769
kind of sends down vitamin D to us is

9
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,719
that necessary 100% the case but learn

10
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,179
about what the Sun does give us and what

11
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,698
we do absorb here and how it does relate

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,349
to our vitamin D production so you can

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,060
see here our sunlight shining down and

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,700
all these people on the nice beach here

15
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:36,449
and many of them are getting exposed to

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,540
the Rays and making a vitamin D so what

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,969
is vitamin D actually d3 is the Pacific

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,619
vitamin there's foods high in vitamin D

19
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,109
so it's not the old sunlight is not the

20
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:47,128
only source of this it is an important

21
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,670
nutrient for maintaining a healthy

22
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:53,089
skeleton and it forms in an integral

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,489
part of bone metabolism calcium and

24
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,410
phosphorus homeostasis the most natural

25
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,209
way to get vitamin D is of course by

26
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,488
exposing your bare skin to sunlight

27
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,140
ultrafine be raised in particular I

28
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:05,728
stressed the point bare skin if you're

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,590
just outside and you're all kind of

30
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,079
bundled up and covered up with jackets

31
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,040
and hats and gloves you're not really

32
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,658
getting the vitamin D production 1000 IU

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,570
which is international units is what's

34
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,240
considered what people need as far as a

35
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:23,728
sufficient vitamin D ml see so we're

36
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,949
gonna relate to the Sun now remember the

37
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:27,179
Sun produces a visible light but also

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,228
we're going to be focusing here on the

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,150
ultraviolet lights

40
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:35,039
UVC UVB and UVA in particular so

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,530
starting with our UV rays and exposure

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,780
alfe remember UVC is filtered out

43
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,239
actually by the atmosphere so while the

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,189
Sun does produce UV see rays they're

45
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,759
filtered out well above our heads in the

46
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:49,978
stratosphere and into the ozone UVB rays

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,438
kind of this wavelength here considered

48
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,719
burning they enter the surface of the

49
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,898
epidermal layer and remember that's our

50
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,989
top layer of the skin UVA are considered

51
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,239
aging our UV wavelengths because they

52
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:05,938
penetrate deep into the dermis and the

53
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,579
sub-q days are hypodermis just well the

54
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:11,280
hypodermis kind of layer there or these

55
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,780
we cannot see this is our visible light

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,509
spectrum our ultraviolet here

57
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,840
in less than approximately 400

58
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:21,669
nanometers so that 200 ish to 400 is

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,909
nanometers in wavelength that we can't

60
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:27,309
say so which I mentioned those UV bytes

61
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:30,310
is you may have seen sunglasses and they

62
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,069
offer UV protection filters out 100% of

63
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,280
all UV a B and C and harmful blue light

64
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:39,189
up to 400 nanometers are polarized great

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,439
marketing but to filter out a hundred

66
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:43,199
percent of UVC rays it may sound great

67
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,729
there's one kind of major flaw with this

68
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,649
well the atmosphere actually filters out

69
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:49,560
the UVC rays so you're not really

70
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,819
exposed to those wavelengths

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,439
unless you're kind of taking your

72
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:57,609
sunglasses up above the ozone layer so

73
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,969
they are maybe maybe right there you

74
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,650
filtering out those UVC rays but you're

75
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:03,969
probably not being exposed to them in

76
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,769
the first place so just kind of watch

77
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:08,259
the marketing on certain things when you

78
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:10,349
understand the science I can kind of see

79
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:12,789
through some of the things that they are

80
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:16,568
offering up in their kind of

81
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:21,719
advertisements to you so skin type does

82
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:23,949
impact this ability to process vitamin D

83
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,180
some people you know burn easily they

84
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:27,069
start individuals here on the beach

85
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,500
summer probably soon as Ohio burn very

86
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,569
easily some people more likely to tan

87
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,590
and some you'll have an innate

88
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:37,840
protections so remember that this you

89
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,670
have more than just your skin type you

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,890
could also use sunscreen or simply

91
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:44,139
covering your skin can reduce UV light

92
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,298
exposure here in Saudi Arabia there's a

93
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:48,250
lot of Sun there's not a lot of shade

94
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:50,680
simply covering yourself can help reduce

95
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,509
your exposure and we're looking at the

96
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,150
UVA rays linked to tanning and here's

97
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:57,608
our visible light and then our UV being

98
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,230
related to vitamin D so how does the

99
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:01,659
skin type what's the point of going over

100
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:03,429
this even well this guy table below

101
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,349
shows different types of skin types

102
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,870
they're just labels can take one two

103
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:09,819
three four five and six and here's their

104
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,890
skin colors a little description and

105
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:13,629
some characteristics you're probably

106
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:15,429
most familiar to characteristics if you

107
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:18,250
know someone always burns never tans

108
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,829
they're kind of that skin type one their

109
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,889
very fair red or blond hair blue eyes

110
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:26,348
freckles and get into kind of type three

111
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,370
here sometimes a mild burn gradually

112
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:29,620
tans fair

113
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,290
in the eye or hair color very common

114
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,600
skin type and all the way here is six

115
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,449
black hair dark brown eyes may never

116
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,860
burn tans very easily it's important to

117
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,939
understand your skin type because you're

118
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,139
gonna see how that relates to your

119
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:45,728
amount of light exposure so you may have

120
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,860
heard I need ten minutes of sunlight and

121
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:49,569
I don't get my vitamin D well that's not

122
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,150
always the case it's kind of what's son

123
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,769
doing need an F is not ten minutes well

124
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:56,589
specific recommendations to reset one

125
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:59,649
thousand international units of vitamin

126
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:01,689
D or not that easy to figure out skin

127
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:05,349
types are different depending on the day

128
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:07,810
of year in place and time of day the

129
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,990
recommendations all vary so here's two

130
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,478
examples here both at noon one here in

131
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,400
Miami and one near in Boston so starting

132
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:17,139
this to Miami bright sunny Miami if you

133
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,909
have skin type three you'll probably

134
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,100
need about six minutes of exposure to

135
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,110
Sun in summer and 15 minutes in the

136
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,870
winter we're in the winter in the

137
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,310
northern hemisphere that kind of angle

138
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,990
of the sun's going to be a little less

139
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,720
in the winter or less intense that's how

140
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,180
you need a greater amount of time

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,139
however if your skin type of five still

142
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,300
in Miami at noon

143
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,848
probably need about 15 minutes in the

144
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,400
summer and thirty minutes in the winter

145
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:45,219
it's a little different there risk in

146
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,038
type five your skin type five again it's

147
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,500
at darker brown color versus fair skin

148
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:52,120
color for that skin type three if you're

149
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,949
in Boston now at noon someone with skin

150
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,720
type three will probably need about an

151
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:58,598
hour of exposure of the Sun in the

152
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,580
summer and someone in the summer with

153
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:02,620
skin type five oh I need about two hours

154
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:03,788
of exposure in the summer if you

155
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,910
anywhere I got these numbers from the

156
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:08,228
link is located here at the bottom now

157
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,689
during winter which is interesting about

158
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:12,159
Boston that's in winter months it's

159
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:13,990
really not possible for anyone to make

160
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,470
vitamin D in the Sun no matter the skin

161
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,620
type

162
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,360
the sunning those very reduced also

163
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,788
might be typically Boston is very cold

164
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,430
it might be covered up very hard to get

165
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:26,168
any vitamin D from the Sun this is why

166
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,689
it's important also to consume vitamin D

167
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:30,430
in the diet but this hopefully gives you

168
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,610
a little bit of the idea of it's not

169
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,379
just as easy as only ten minutes of Sun

170
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,960
depends on your skin type depends on

171
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:40,538
your location and also depends on the

172
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,288
season so hopefully this gets you a

173
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:44,098
greater under

174
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:46,088
four bodies and you're able to

175
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:48,848
manufacture and make vitamin D from the

176
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:53,129
Sun and realize it's not as easy as that

177
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:53,128
simple yeah ten minutes and I'm good
