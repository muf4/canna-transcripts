00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,318
this debaco university video is going to

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,119
go over recognizing some of the visual

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:17,519
cues of the flower size and development

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:19,039
of your cannabis bud or flower

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,960
all right let's get into recognizing the

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,520
visual cues of cannabis plants flower

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,240
size

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,160
and development so first off we're

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,719
talking about cannabis flowers

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,960
remember that while large and dense buds

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,719
are desirable this is not like growing a

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,000
zucchini if you let it grow longer it

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,480
will not simply just get

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,840
bigger your goal is to maximize not

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,238
necessarily the size

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
but the chemical compounds even though

17
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,759
when we get into this increased

18
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,679
density that we see here this can be

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,920
dense this can increase the

20
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,799
total amount of chemicals that's being

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,640
produced

22
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,238
just because these are very similar in

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
physical size this one

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,558
is much less dense this will not have

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,039
this edge much chemical compounds

26
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,599
gram for gram ounce per ounce as this

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,679
one

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,359
so again just keep that in mind that

29
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,599
bigger is not always better

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
bigger and denser with those higher

31
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,919
chemical profiles is how chemical

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,439
percentages

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,320
is really what's deemed to be desirable

34
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,599
so flower bud in size well typically the

35
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,758
buds exposed to the most

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,438
light will become the largest so these

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,640
are typically the apical buds these are

38
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,719
typically the top

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,159
buds this is why so many pruning

40
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,798
strategies particularly for indoor

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,640
growers

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,320
have this as a main goal to kind of

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,359
organize and orient their buds so that

44
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,519
as many are pointing

45
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,560
upwards towards that maximum light as

46
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,078
possible

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,240
with that different pruning strategy

48
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,839
with that idea that time and labor

49
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,158
the advantages you'll get more of the

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,399
larger buds and less of the smaller

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,159
secondary or sometimes called popcorn

52
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,200
buds that simply are not going to

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,560
produce

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,520
as much per flower of the chemicals that

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,920
these will produce

56
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,280
so looking at compounds versus size so

57
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
keep in mind if the goal

58
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,118
is internal compounds why is size even a

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,799
consideration

60
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,718
well the large size is desirable and

61
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,200
demonstrates good growing practices

62
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,158
so these typically get top dollar as

63
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,079
these are the most

64
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,118
sought after however if you're looking

65
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,038
to try to sample a different variety

66
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,120
consider second cut flower as these have

67
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,679
similar chemical properties and profiles

68
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,159
but due to reduced size they come at a

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
cost

70
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,239
savings so you can get a better dollar

71
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,319
better return on investment if you have

72
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,920
those larger denser buds even though

73
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,359
really we're looking at kind of what is

74
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,079
in that but it was chemically what is in

75
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
that bud

76
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,959
but something about this just those

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,239
large buds shows that that grower

78
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,039
probably has a little bit of growing

79
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,439
practices

80
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,479
able to maximize that yield maximize the

81
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,959
size and density

82
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,238
typically will also mean to maximizing

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,400
the compounds present

84
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,159
and that's why those get top dollar but

85
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
don't discount the smaller secondary cut

86
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,000
buds if you're looking at a new variety

87
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
or something a little different those

88
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
can have very similar profiles

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,719
at a reduced cost to try something else

90
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,800
out and then

91
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,959
potentially if you like that there are

92
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
those larger more denser compounds

93
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
those higher premium flowers that you

94
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,159
can progress to

95
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,158
just as another option
