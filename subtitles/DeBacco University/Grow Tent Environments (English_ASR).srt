1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
you're gonna look at the grow tent

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:06,660
environments and I have two side-by-side

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,609
pictures here the same grow tent listen

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,199
with the full-spectrum LED light off and

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,750
this with it on so you need to get

6
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,298
appreciation here for the reflectivity

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,429
of that kind of mylar backing there and

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:21,600
not fully set up but these are becoming

9
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:23,160
very popular for a lot of reasons these

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,140
are the smallest of operations use that

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,969
same grow tent with the light on here's

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,170
it all sealed up they're becoming very

13
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,698
popular because it can be placed

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,349
anywhere they're very versatile making

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,989
place in closets bedrooms spare rooms

16
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,689
and you know anywhere where there is a

17
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:39,419
basically dead space as access to power

18
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:40,949
this small area is easy to regulate and

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,260
many come with many very friendly

20
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,000
options this makes light and charcoal

21
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,119
filter installation very simple very

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,939
easy kind of snap fittings on and off

23
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,859
you go they offer easy access and which

24
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:56,820
can be very beneficial to the grower you

25
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:58,229
can be consider right in the room quite

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,198
in an area that doesn't need necessary

27
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:02,878
outside lighting so this as part of the

28
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,368
reasons why protests have become so

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,920
popular they offer ability to fit in a

30
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:10,319
variety of spaces from very small to

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,790
very large so here's a small little 2 by

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,489
2 10 that's kind of one of the smallest

33
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,618
ones they make and they go up to a 10

34
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:20,129
foot by 20 foot it's a very very large

35
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:21,959
grow 10 2 feet by 4 feet very popular

36
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,429
that's what this size is and one of the

37
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,280
reason device popular is can easily

38
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,049
moved through standard doorways so it's

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,700
just fit through the standard doorway

40
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,770
but it makes it really easy to move from

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,950
room to room if you so choose

42
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:37,109
now that 2x4 fits in a lot of good areas

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,299
and here's kind of the underlying

44
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,040
supporting structure so the ease of

45
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,049
these grow tents is that they have this

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,049
self-contained internal support

47
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,670
structure which allows for attachment

48
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,189
here you can see of different Lighting's

49
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,079
here makes it very quick and easy these

50
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:53,429
grow tents allow a great way to enter

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,589
into the growing world because they're

52
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,840
nice small and contained you can be done

53
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,189
on a budget they do their popularity

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,350
there's a lot of options becoming

55
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:02,758
available for these they can also buffer

56
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:05,188
outdoor growers to continue

57
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,769
experimenting even during an off season

58
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,840
so if you find that one key mother plant

59
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:12,419
or this kind of try something out

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,810
allows growers to keep growing even if

61
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,809
it's very cold or not

62
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,310
Gusev outside what they do is they

63
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,170
create this isolated environment which

64
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,270
can allow for experimentation to occur

65
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:24,789
under constant and controlled conditions

66
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,920
we can see the example of some different

67
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:29,109
models here it also be kind of

68
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,000
considered as like growth chambers where

69
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,120
you're able to isolate and test maybe

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,009
one variable also due to this isolation

71
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,620
the cloning propagation environments

72
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:40,179
lend themselves well to grow ten even if

73
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,219
large areas for vegetative flower and

74
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,069
growth are used and easily increased new

75
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:47,289
humidity easily regulate the light and

76
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:49,389
easily keep maybe multiple racks of

77
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:52,689
clones or cuttings in a relatively small

78
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:54,039
footprint they often require odor

79
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:56,469
control especially for current for a

80
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,879
full term also keep this in mind you

81
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:59,590
might want to install carbon filter

82
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,689
again we typically would want to vent

83
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,229
this out the top possible this is an

84
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:06,789
easy access here this helps minimize the

85
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:09,250
square feet of space when you go

86
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:10,829
vertical here and again depending on the

87
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,239
operation or what you're trying to grow

88
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,280
that can also afford you different

89
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,840
opportunities having this tall design

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,579
though even if you're on only on one

91
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,459
level may be advantageous because

92
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:24,280
there's a lot easier management for heat

93
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,599
for example want to be careful so even

94
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,799
though these may be a small footprint of

95
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,389
space you want to watch the power

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,000
consumption it's easy to start stringing

97
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:34,000
a bunch of lights and fans and motors

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,159
and pumps all together so just be

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,139
careful and be mindful of the total

100
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,590
power consumption of your respective

101
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,589
