00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,640
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,480
where if you're considering adding

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,120
carbon dioxide to your cannabis

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,199
production this will go over the basics

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,359
to help you make an informed decision

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,919
and things to look out for if you are

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,919
considering this

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,320
all right let's look at carbon dioxide

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,159
basics for cannabis production

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,160
so starting first you have to understand

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,880
that cannabis specifically

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
is what's called a c3 plant similar in

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,280
structure for its photosynthetic process

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,920
as tomatoes would be the other types are

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
called

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,800
c4 plants they include corn and sugar

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
cane and cam plants are cacti

18
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,919
you can see there's different processes

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,399
that they go through

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,079
as they prepare carbon dioxide for the

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
calvin cycle

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,920
c3 plants is basically a direct

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,679
incorporation of carbon dioxide to the

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,719
calvin cycle

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,759
so keep in mind with carbon dioxide

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,198
it's heavier than air so dry is to add

27
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,839
carbon dioxide as you can see here put

28
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,079
it in the

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,000
suspended kind of container here well

30
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,959
this is not advised we can see that the

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,959
carbon dioxide in this case dry ice is

32
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,399
kind of going from the solid state to

33
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,359
the gaseous state and here it's falling

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
through the plants

35
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,719
but this is not going to really create

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,640
anything that's going to be very

37
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,719
consistent or really meet the plant's

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,239
needs yes we'll add carbon dioxide

39
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,640
but it will not add it in a consistent

40
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,239
manner now the environmental factors you

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,519
want to consider with a plant in general

42
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,719
is that light intensity

43
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,640
the amount of carbon dioxide and the

44
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,078
temperature keep in mind as the light

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,280
intensity increases there'll be a

46
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,399
certain plateau

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
same goes with the amount of carbon

48
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,320
dioxide you can increase the rate

49
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,919
of the concentration of carbon dioxide

50
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,078
this will increase the rate of

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,200
photosynthesis and then temperature

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,519
there will be a rise

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
in ideal or optimum temperature and then

54
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,039
a falling off

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,478
from there so you want to keep in mind

56
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,360
all these factors

57
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,039
for that your plant is growing in so

58
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,239
we're going to focus of course here on

59
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,920
the carbon diox

60
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,679
oxide aspect it's important input to the

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,399
photosynthetic equation as we can see

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,520
here carbon dioxide plus water plus

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,360
sunlight will produce sugar and oxygen

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,879
all the carbon that forms in the sugar

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,120
end product here

66
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,560
originated as carbon dioxide molecule in

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,039
the air that's why there's six of them

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,039
here

69
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,159
because we have to make a six carbon

70
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,439
sugar

71
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,799
so low carbon dioxide and equals low

72
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,959
growth rate and these little brackets

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
mean concentration so if you look at a

74
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,200
lettuce study notice that there are

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,200
changes in dry

76
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,280
mass or yield at different light

77
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,119
intensities across the range of co2

78
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,159
concentration levels so here's our co2

79
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,519
concentration

80
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,120
and we can see here different light

81
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
intensities so we can make the

82
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,159
conclusion here that increasing the

83
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,919
light intensity no matter what the

84
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,359
concentration of carbon oxide will

85
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,518
increase yields at least

86
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,280
provided in this study here but we can

87
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800
see also the trend that as you increase

88
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,519
carbon monoxide concentration from

89
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,120
ambient

90
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,640
it's going to be around 400 somewhere

91
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,640
around this range right here

92
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,079
we can see that there is an increase

93
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,000
overall in the dry mass or yield

94
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
now this reference article that if i

95
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,800
included here

96
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,280
is looking at the photosynthetic

97
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
response of cannabis in relation to

98
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,479
variations

99
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
in photosynthetic photon flux densities

100
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,039
temperature

101
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
and for this video carbon dioxide

102
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,878
conditions but you're welcome to check

103
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,200
this out for more details

104
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,318
now net photosynthesis in cannabis so

105
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,039
when we're looking at specifically

106
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,399
cannabis

107
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,798
the optimum temperature for

108
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,959
photosynthesis is around 30 degrees

109
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
celsius temperature higher than 30

110
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
degrees has been

111
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,599
has adverse effects uh on the

112
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,920
photosynthetic rate it actually starts

113
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,000
to curl over and start to decrease

114
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,439
at 25 degrees celsius the rate of

115
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,360
synthesis is increased

116
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,878
but with increasing ppfd and that's

117
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,840
we're looking at the light intensity

118
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,719
measurement

119
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,239
but this trend was peaked at about 1500

120
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,719
micro moles of pdf

121
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,439
of ppfd which is the light intensity at

122
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,680
30 degrees

123
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,639
celsius and decreased at higher light

124
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,239
intensities

125
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,919
so this means as you increase light

126
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,158
intensities there's kind of this optimum

127
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,438
here based on intensity and temperature

128
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,199
and more is not always better looking at

129
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:03,840
the optimum temperatures around 30

130
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,199
degrees

131
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,200
celsius and 1500 micro moles for light

132
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,399
intensity should be around your target

133
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,280
levels

134
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,640
now carbon dioxide levels in this case

135
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,519
pn is net

136
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,599
photosynthesis we see this column here

137
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,918
and w-e-e

138
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,199
is water use efficiency on the leaves of

139
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,120
cannabis sativa

140
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,800
and here's the carbon dioxide levels

141
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,720
here we can see that there's a change

142
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,319
we can see there's also alterations in

143
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
these now as we're looking at what has

144
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,360
the highest net

145
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,400
photosynthesis well we can see here 750

146
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,439
uh micro moles of concentration of

147
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,599
carbon dioxide

148
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,478
just as a reminder around 400 is what

149
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,160
would be considered atmospheric levels

150
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,519
now again comparing here to our light

151
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,439
levels notice

152
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,198
how at high light levels plants can be

153
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,319
better you can better utilize the added

154
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,400
carbon monoxide

155
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,360
if adding carbon dioxide make sure

156
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,039
plants are not

157
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,199
light limited so just adding more carbon

158
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,960
dioxide is okay but we could see here is

159
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,199
that ambient level

160
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,399
uh here with low light well we could add

161
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,478
a lot of carbon dioxide

162
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,959
and really not get any more kind of

163
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,319
increase in the rate of photosynthesis

164
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,680
and we can see that these all of these

165
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,159
even the highlight level does have a

166
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,319
sort of

167
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,520
plateau to it so this should be the

168
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,519
light intensity should be measured with

169
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,918
a par meter to ensure that adding carbon

170
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,758
dioxide will actually be utilized

171
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,359
where are your light levels at and this

172
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,280
is just an example of this study

173
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,038
showing what's considered low medium and

174
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,799
high light levels

175
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,719
now concerns about carbon dioxide from a

176
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,038
grower's standpoint keep in mind that

177
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
concentrations above 5000 can be harmful

178
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,079
to

179
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,759
to humans and when we're looking at

180
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,079
enriching an area with carbon dioxide

181
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,000
for

182
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,478
plants we're looking really not going

183
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,839
much more than a thousand so it is not

184
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,319
necessarily going to cause

185
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,159
any sort of harmful effects or hopefully

186
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,839
any of the conditions labeled here

187
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
we're looking at the volume of the air

188
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,439
really not getting into any of that here

189
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,639
the levels that would be acceptable for

190
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,000
plants

191
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,680
now how do you estimate your carbon

192
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,879
dioxide usage everyone wants to know how

193
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,160
much you're going to use

194
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:05,038
just providing a random example here for

195
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,280
an area looking at a 32 foot by 40 foot

196
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,519
high tunnel that was 32 foot wide 40

197
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,038
feet long and 12 feet at the peak

198
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,318
operating at about a thousand parts per

199
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,318
million of carbon dioxide with the

200
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,960
system turned off during venting

201
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
periods of high heat it uses 50 pounds

202
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,000
of co2 per week

203
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,240
and again this is intended to simply be

204
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,918
a rough estimate looking at if you're

205
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,879
using carbon monoxide from compressed

206
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:26,478
air bottles

207
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,439
you can expect if you have this area to

208
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,680
go through about 150 pound bottle a week

209
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,600
plus or minus from there but just a

210
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
rough idea there

211
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,919
now when should carbon dioxide be added

212
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,600
in short from emergence to harvest

213
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,279
uh people say i want to save it for the

214
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,039
harvest i want to do at the beginning

215
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,399
really for the entire life cycle and be

216
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:45,918
definitely utilized

217
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,839
however if it's not possible that for

218
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,598
the entire life cycle then it actually

219
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,000
may be more critical in the early stages

220
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,159
to get the plants established early

221
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
seedling phases is great time because

222
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,280
often plants might be slow to get going

223
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,279
but the carbon dioxide can help

224
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,279
increase root mass which of course is

225
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,079
very important especially

226
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,758
in the early stages of plant growth now

227
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,199
autoflowers and carbon dioxide well all

228
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,879
strains will benefit from the adding

229
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,720
carbon dioxide but it's highly

230
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,478
recommended for autoflowers

231
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,759
because there is a set number of days

232
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,918
between when they emerge

233
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,598
and when they will be harvested growers

234
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,038
should be seeking every possible way to

235
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,959
maximize each day

236
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,800
and carbon dioxide enrichment allows for

237
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,279
higher light intensities to be used

238
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,919
again assuming all other factors are not

239
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,839
limiting

240
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,758
which will result in a greater biomass

241
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,079
production this will translate into

242
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,160
higher

243
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,000
yields on a plant that only has a set

244
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
number of days to complete its life

245
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,639
cycle

246
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,639
so if you're looking at well what i want

247
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
to try it try it with autoflowers

248
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,199
because you have a set number of days

249
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,239
you want to maximize

250
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,038
each and every day so will carbonacci

251
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,160
increase

252
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,560
plant production i say yes but or

253
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,280
yes if there are no other limiting

254
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,879
factors

255
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,839
if your plants are receiving optimum

256
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,639
light optimum nutrients water aeration

257
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,439
then carbon dioxide can be used to boost

258
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,160
your plants

259
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,759
in need keep in mind that with the

260
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,120
addition of carbon monoxide the plants

261
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
will be able to take advantage of

262
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,319
greater light intensities

263
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,318
and will likely require more nutrients

264
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,598
to meet the increased growth rates

265
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,160
so if you've been growing a plant or a

266
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,199
certain type of plant for an extended

267
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,319
period of time and feel you have

268
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,598
everything dialed in

269
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,680
and now you want to go through and add

270
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,759
carbon monoxide some of those things

271
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,680
may change particularly watering

272
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,160
frequencies or nutrient consumption

273
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,038
might be higher so have records you

274
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,840
should be keeping

275
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,800
compare those records but realize carbon

276
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,120
dioxide may

277
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,879
speed things up but a lot of times

278
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,759
growers can utilize that to their

279
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,759
advantage
