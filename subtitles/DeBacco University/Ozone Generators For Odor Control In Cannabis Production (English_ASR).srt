00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,678
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,359
where i'm going to go over

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,878
ozone generators if you're looking at

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:16,480
reducing odor with

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:17,920
associated with cannabis production

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,519
so if you've come here to learn more

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,480
about ozone generators you've come to

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,320
the right place

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
here in debacle university let's get

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,278
into ozone generators for odor control

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,160
in cannabis production so first off

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,238
ozone generators no surprise use ozone

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,238
and ozone is this o3 molecule which is

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,199
simply three oxygen molecules bonded

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,599
together

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,239
this will remove odors from your growth

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,239
space

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,159
ozone can reduce contamination such as

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,959
mold bacteria odors as well as some

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,959
pests

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,480
ozone generators should be appropriately

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,719
sized to match your grow space

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,878
and or ducting system and are the most

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,679
technologically advanced method for odor

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,159
removal

26
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,759
we see just a basic little diagram here

27
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,558
what's going on inside the ozone

28
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,878
generator

29
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,679
we can see the incorporation of uv light

30
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,000
fans to help

31
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,039
move air through again and reducing the

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,159
odor

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,840
through this process so word of caution

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,320
if you are considering

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,560
utilizing an ozone generator they should

36
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,559
only be used in commercial applications

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
in areas that are unoccupied

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,159
if you look right here i circled it on

39
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,199
the unit itself it says warning

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,159
used only in unoccupied spaces this is

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,799
because an epa report warns

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
regarding ozone that when inhaled ozone

43
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,079
can damage the lungs

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
relatively low amounts can cause chest

45
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,000
pain coughing shortness of breath

46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,159
and throat irritation ozone may also

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,560
worsen chronic respiratory diseases such

48
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,400
as asthma and compromise the ability

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,040
of the body to fight respiratory

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,079
infections this is why using unoccupied

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
spaces absence

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,919
of humans or animals in general now the

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,118
ozone

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,759
generation limits and the limited

55
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,478
benefits so the fda or food and drug

56
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,399
administration

57
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,239
limits the amount of ozone put out by

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,439
indoor medical devices

59
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,280
to 0.05 parts per million

60
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,359
that number falls below the amounts

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,640
needed to provide any antibacterial

62
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,318
and in the antifungal benefit

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,399
so when we're looking at the generation

64
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,159
levels of ozone

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
while the output for indoor ozone

66
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,919
generators may be minimal

67
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,679
higher levels can accumulate indoors

68
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,878
depending on the circumstances of the

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,239
growing environment

70
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:27,280
in 1995 epa study found that when run on

71
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,280
on high with the doors closed some ozone

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
generators produced a concentration of

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,479
0.2 parts per million

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,760
to 0.3 parts per million this is four to

75
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,639
six times higher

76
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,399
than the fda recommended standards so

77
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,878
again keep in mind of the generation

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,519
levels that occur with to the levels

79
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,799
they occur in the threat that they could

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,400
pose to those in the area now ozone's

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
not just hazardous to the animals or

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,280
humans

83
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
in the area it also could be potentially

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,239
damaging to the plants

85
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,080
ocean drainage can damage plants in

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,840
indoor environments high levels of ozone

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,120
can inhibit plant stomata which are

88
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,598
responsible for

89
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
water and gas regulation in the plant

90
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,799
signs of ozone damage on your plants

91
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,958
will be chlorosis which is yellowing due

92
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,000
to insufficient chlorophyll production

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,840
necrosis which is dying of cells and

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,280
stipples which is tan irregular spots

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,920
and we see some of those represented

96
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,560
here

97
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,679
on this example leaf so if you are

98
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,680
looking at

99
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,719
potentially adding an ozone generator to

100
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
reduce your odors

101
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,199
keep in mind of some of these other

102
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,000
environmental impacts you might want to

103
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,000
consider

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,519
to make sure it's the best fit for your

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,519
growing environment
