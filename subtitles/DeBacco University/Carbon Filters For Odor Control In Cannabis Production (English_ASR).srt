00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,160
we'll be going over carbon filters for

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,130
odor control in cannabis production

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,300
facilities

5
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:10,300
[Music]

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,399
all right if you're looking at reducing

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,079
odors of your cannabis plants

8
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,599
with carbon filters you've come to the

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,759
right place so

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,439
first off how do carbon filters work in

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,118
general have you ever kind of inspected

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,518
one it's kind of what you may see

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,879
and carbon filters simply bind to odor

14
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,119
molecules and prevent them from

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,960
remaining free-floating in the air

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,640
activated carbon has a high amount of

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
surface area per volume

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,558
so it is a great contact while still

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,239
maintaining a high porosity

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,959
so you're not restricting your airflow

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,919
all that much a single gram of activated

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,120
carbon

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,800
features a surface area of over 3 000

24
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,799
meters squared so that's kind of an

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,558
amazing amount of surface area

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,000
and what that translates to is contact

27
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:59,519
points that you can have

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,198
to reduce the odor now fans and filters

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,199
that we may have in our grow facility

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,039
exhaust fans will pull or push air

31
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,640
through the carbon filter before exiting

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,240
the grow space entirely

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,000
this is why we typically see our fans

34
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,079
going to be moving air anyway attaching

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
a carbon filter can reduce odors and

36
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,039
ensure those air being cleaned

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,118
to the outside environment there now

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
keep in mind that humidity does impact

39
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,118
the effectiveness

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
in humidity levels above 70 it's kind of

41
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,400
the limit of effectiveness of carbon

42
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,359
filter so if you're getting

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,200
70 or 75 or above the effectiveness is

44
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,879
going to be severely reduced

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,320
simply because the water molecules in

46
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,319
the air essentially clog

47
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,239
up the carbon pore structure not

48
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,239
allowing contact with the air

49
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,000
think about this really fine droplets of

50
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,280
water eliminating that

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,399
high surface area of the carbon really

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,079
to interact with the air molecules

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
now push or pull air through a carbon

54
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,639
filter it's kind of like the option do i

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,319
pull the air as we see over uh here do i

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,040
pull the air kind of through that carbon

57
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,758
filter

58
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,040
or here am i pushing it kind of through

59
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,319
so some growers will pull air through

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,719
the carbon filter first

61
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,599
and then to a fan before exiting out the

62
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,118
structure

63
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,959
other growers will have the air enter

64
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,560
the fan and then the filter before

65
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,038
exiting to the outside

66
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,759
but for maximum control or odor control

67
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,439
at least

68
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,039
growers will utilize both systems where

69
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,479
they'll pull air through

70
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,079
take out the odors and then they'll run

71
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,439
it through another carbon filter to

72
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,560
absolutely ensure

73
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,560
no odors are escaping their grow tent so

74
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,318
where would you place your carbon filter

75
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,840
so keep in mind that should be mounted

76
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,560
high up in the grow space

77
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,479
so the hottest air will be removed this

78
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,318
will provide also a cooling effect so it

79
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,639
helps with your ventilation system

80
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,159
just kind of adding it as a component in

81
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,279
addition if you're enriching the space

82
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,959
with carbon monoxide

83
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
this will remove the least amount of

84
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,680
carbon dioxide since co2 is heavier than

85
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,519
air

86
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
so mounting that carbon filter high

87
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,640
removes the hottest air with the least

88
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,878
amount of co2

89
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,079
still allowing ventilation but without

90
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,518
allowing kind of all

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,959
competing systems lastly for your carbon

92
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,480
filters a lot of times they look like

93
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,158
they're white cotton based filters

94
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,518
but really what that is is the

95
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,359
pre-filter

96
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,879
and before air comes into contact with

97
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
the carbon it should pass through a

98
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,759
pre-filter

99
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,799
we'll simply filter out particulates not

100
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,079
the odors

101
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,519
why would you have a pre-filter if

102
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,959
you're not really doing odor control

103
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,719
well this is important because

104
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,319
if the air with high amounts of

105
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,959
particulate come in contact with the

106
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,878
carbon

107
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,878
despite its high surface area it will

108
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,759
actually clog up the pores and reduce

109
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,239
the effective

110
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,239
life of the carbon filter also keep in

111
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,360
mind pre-filters are not very expensive

112
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,000
they extend the life of the carbon

113
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,120
filter and are easily washed and reused

114
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,479
all good positive aspects

115
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,158
which is the reason why they should be

116
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,560
added and if those get dirty you can

117
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:38,158
simply

118
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
wash them out clean them throw them back

119
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,318
on and it really will help extend the

120
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,039
life

121
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,798
of the more expensive carbon filter and

122
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,280
extend the life of your ability to

123
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,879
reduce

124
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,878
odors from your grow space
