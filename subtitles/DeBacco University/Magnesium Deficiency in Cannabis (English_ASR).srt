1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,430
okay here we look at magnesium

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:07,949
deficiency in cannabis plants so

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:09,928
magnesium is a vital nutrient something

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,660
some growers may not initially think

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,859
about but when they see a problem

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,660
something that may come up on the list

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,730
and be sure to check out some other

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,189
videos on looking at other deficiency

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,230
symptoms in cannabis so it's going on

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,350
with magnesium in particular in this

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,960
case so magnesium well why does a plant

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,660
even need magnesium is often you know

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,368
the question growers may ask keep in

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,289
mind that magnesium is a mobile nutrient

15
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,429
meaning it can move through the plant it

16
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:37,829
has a dominant role with the

17
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,719
photosynthetic process so it's

18
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,780
associated processing the chloroplasts

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,579
that green color that real nice green

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,460
color we typically associate with plants

21
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,100
as part of the responsibility of

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,679
magnesium or that 35% of the leaf

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,170
magnesium is actually located within

24
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,850
those chloroplasts the magnesium is

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,309
involved with the verbiski enzyme

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,770
activation activity and that is very

27
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,628
important to initiate that carbon

28
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,510
binding with the photosynthetic process

29
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:08,519
there now the magnesium does impact the

30
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,939
chloroplast structure and the synthesis

31
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:14,728
so it is involved on a micro level but

32
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,368
we can see macro effects in the plant

33
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:19,289
the deficiency leads to reduction in the

34
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,750
plant's ability to utilize carbon

35
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,000
dioxide assimilation rates and reduces

36
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,030
rates of biomass formation and that can

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,478
reduce the yield in the end result and

38
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,280
also in the simple plant biomass both

39
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,879
negative aspects of growers want to

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,469
avoid now a trial is done so kind of a

41
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,599
unique thing here with cannabis

42
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,310
now the cultivars wife the police plants

43
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,750
are you're gonna see about 80 days old

44
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,399
it's grown in a greenhouse to help

45
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,409
maintain consistent conditions

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,359
you never see a control plant that was

47
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,759
fed a balanced fertilizer and then a

48
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,039
test plant was fed all the nutrients at

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,750
optimum levels except the one being

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,810
studied in this case it would be a

51
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,188
magnesium deficient plant

52
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,978
so specifically here's the cannabis

53
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:03,118
plant that we can see see it's a little

54
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,879
hard to tell

55
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,560
zoomed in there's another image that I

56
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,288
found this is kind of what you're

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,120
looking for that slight yelling of the

58
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,009
lower leaves here

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,340
is kind of what you're looking for the

60
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:19,620
veins of the plant will remain that

61
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,628
typical consistent dark green color

62
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,759
which we're looking as in between those

63
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:25,889
veins you have the yellowing so you have

64
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,268
this kind of dark green veins but then

65
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:29,729
you have that yellow and that is

66
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:32,370
occurring that yellowing on lower leaves

67
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:35,818
in particular is characteristic of a

68
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,650
magnesium deficiency so in cannabis

69
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,419
there can also be some stippling some

70
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,730
brown spots that you kind of see going

71
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,768
on here at least a little bit here in

72
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:46,108
the lower leaves they may not turn

73
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,659
completely yellow so this is a great

74
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:50,189
example of how sometimes the plants

75
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,409
don't follow the textbook exactly

76
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:54,568
because this is actual cannabis plant

77
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,159
that was particularly fed magnesium

78
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:59,818
deficient fertilizer ich Ihnen so you

79
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,489
kind of get to see firsthand what what

80
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,378
may occur or how the plant may react may

81
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,819
not always be that textbook here you're

82
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:07,828
noticing they have those brown spots

83
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:10,439
that are kind of developing it's another

84
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:12,810
kind indication of a potential magnesium

85
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,340
deficiency I tend to be first seen in

86
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,628
those lower leaves so if you're seeing

87
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,370
right at the top that might be something

88
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:19,739
else here we're looking at that older

89
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,219
leaves those lower leaves can progress

90
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,450
up the plant if the problem is not

91
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:26,340
corrected so it's important to recognize

92
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:26,969
it's occurring the lower leaves could be

93
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,590
magnesium

94
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:30,780
let me start to feed some magnesium

95
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,939
fertilizer so a lot of growers asked

96
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,759
well what may that look like we have

97
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,769
some different options so applications

98
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,870
it should be made repeatedly and on

99
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,280
regular intervals until the problem

100
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,719
stops progressing because it might take

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,729
a little while that the buildup in the

102
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,469
plant don't expect a one-time

103
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:49,168
application to kind of fix the problem

104
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:51,689
I've read some suggested fertilizers in

105
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:54,000
suggested application rates for a two by

106
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:56,189
two foot area but followed the

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,709
recommendations on the package that you

108
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:00,689
may be purchasing epsom salts is one and

109
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,340
that's kind of quick and easy one to two

110
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,919
tablespoons per gallon and it can be

111
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,409
applied as a soil drench or can also be

112
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,939
applied to the leaves directly the

113
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,009
advantage is it's very easy to get

114
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,919
drugstores have it just go out grab it

115
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:15,539
you can apply it the same day it only

116
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,478
supplies magnesium and there's some

117
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,310
sulfur also added there there's a

118
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,108
cal-mag product this one's by patina

119
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,780
care but you want to start at about an

120
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,500
ounce to a gallon and the advantage of

121
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,989
that is it

122
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,939
a magnesium but also that supplies the

123
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,530
plant with some calcium that could be an

124
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:34,019
issue especially for growing in cocoa

125
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:36,599
qua the Kansa of the options prevented

126
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:39,689
here that is the most expensive but it

127
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,460
does have the ability to help correct

128
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,230
that deficiency and especially if you

129
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,799
have a calcium issue can up correct that

130
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,780
as well

131
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,430
the last one I cut included here is

132
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:50,219
dolomitic lime so if you're growing in

133
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,160
an outdoor application or you need a pH

134
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,810
correction anyway if your soil tends to

135
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,570
be a little bit on the acidic side need

136
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,970
to add lime you can add adult dolomitic

137
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,709
lime this is calcium lime this has that

138
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,900
plate as much on 90s and with it but

139
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,689
dolomitic would be a great option there

140
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:09,079
it's free I say with the line because

141
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:10,949
that line naturally is high in magnesium

142
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,930
but it could only use for soil

143
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,180
applications that you're trying to raise

144
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,790
the pH so you kind of got to balance

145
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,379
your options in what particular growing

146
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,090
situations you're looking at

147
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,129
so hopefully this provides a little bit

148
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:26,489
of that kind of that real-world kind of

149
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:28,110
example of how plants may not always

150
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,519
follow the textbook but gives you

151
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,949
something to look at or helps you

152
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,699
identify the potential deficiency that

153
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:34,699
you may be having
