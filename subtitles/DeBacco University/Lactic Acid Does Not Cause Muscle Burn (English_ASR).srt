1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
okay yes you read that title correctly

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,798
lactic acid does not

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,279
cause muscle burn so let's go into kind

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,039
of the misconception of why it does and

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,638
what actually is causing that muscle

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,160
burn your feeling

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,759
so when you exercise the source of

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,960
energy is glucose and it's broken down

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,600
to pyruvate

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,118
pyruvate is then used in either aerobic

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,840
if oxygen is present or

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,278
anaerobic fermentation with no oxygen

13
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,278
present process

14
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,320
both yield atp which is the energy

15
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,640
currency of the cell

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,920
but very different amounts so when

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
there's a lack of oxygen you're only

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,359
getting about two atps in aerobic you're

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,120
generating a lot more

20
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,439
we're also saying this lactic acid being

21
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,799
generated in an anaerobic

22
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,320
environment there we could see the

23
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,199
person here at least training their

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,238
muscles there

25
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,079
running through a lot of atp

26
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,078
now aerobic respiration involves a

27
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,920
citric acid or krebs cycle

28
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,920
oxidative phosphorylation which is the

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,480
process of generating atp

30
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
with no negative byproducts from either

31
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,238
and

32
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,239
high atp production this is why

33
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,679
oxygen or utilizing oxygen is so

34
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,759
efficient because

35
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,400
not a lot of negative products generated

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,478
and a very efficient way of generating

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,640
lots of atp so what causes the actual

38
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,000
burn to the muscles if it's not this

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,478
lactic acid

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,200
well it's release of protons during the

41
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,200
atp

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,478
breakdown that's increasing the acidity

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,159
resulting in the burning

44
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:28,719
feeling so in short yes it is an acid

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,079
it's simply just not lactic acid because

46
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,560
remember the

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,879
increasing proton concentration will

48
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,159
create an acidic environment we see here

49
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,920
so as hydrogen ions amount increases

50
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,439
we have this acidic environment that's

51
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,079
being created is

52
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,118
this acid environment that causes the

53
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,519
burning feeling

54
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,840
that reduction in ph so what you're

55
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,280
seeing here is our atp

56
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,759
being broken down and you'll notice

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,280
there is that release from atp to adp

58
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,200
density triphosphate

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,399
to insulin diphosphate there is a

60
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
breaking of that

61
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,759
phosphate group and also this

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,560
all-important release of hydrogen ion

63
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,879
causing

64
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,600
a decrease in ph resulting in acidic

65
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,758
environment causing the burn

66
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,639
so lactic acids and lactates roll well

67
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,639
the terms

68
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,000
lactate and lactic acid are often used

69
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,839
interchangeably but

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,039
lactate is the component measured in the

71
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
blood blood

72
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,039
and is strictly a weak base and lactic

73
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,639
acid is the corresponding acid so it

74
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,679
kind of flips back and forth between

75
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,839
these two

76
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,840
the lactic acid age your muscles as an

77
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,039
energy source can actually help reduce

78
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,439
the acidity

79
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,759
again this kind of binding of these

80
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,598
hydrogen ions to produce again the

81
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,560
lactic acid here can actually be

82
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:41,359
beneficial at reducing potentially

83
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,319
the burning muscle feeling contrary to

84
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,000
popular belief

85
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,518
you may experience the day after muscle

86
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
burn known as delayed onset

87
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
muscle soreness this day aft the day

88
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,440
after you exercise you feel kind of that

89
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
burning achy feeling in your muscles

90
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,280
it's likely due to microscopic tears in

91
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,439
your muscles inner irritation of pain

92
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,360
receptors during the exercising process

93
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,280
however believe it or not this process

94
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
is actually not well understood

95
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,719
so you kind of get up in the morning you

96
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,840
have that kind of soreness it could be

97
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:12,479
in part due to these torn muscles

98
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,280
but likely not to the lactic acid for

99
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,359
sure

100
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,318
but again that acid that's breaking

101
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,640
those atps

102
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,598
that's your cause so it is an acid

103
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,279
simply put

104
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,280
don't blame lactic acid
