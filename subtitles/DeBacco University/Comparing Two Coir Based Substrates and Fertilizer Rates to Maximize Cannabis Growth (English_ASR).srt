1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,640
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,199
going to present a study where they

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,160
compare

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,400
two cocoa based substrates and

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,160
fertilizer rates to maximize cannabis

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,919
growth and you're going to see

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,920
and i'll share with you some of the data

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,920
presented in that study

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,800
[Music]

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,320
all right let's get into comparing some

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,880
to uh choir based

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
substrates so first off as always here's

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,320
the article here's the kind of front

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,039
page here's this proper citation here's

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,799
a link

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,719
so if you look or want some more

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,479
information about it this is where you

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,439
would go through and look for i'm only

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,959
going to provide a brief

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,039
summary here so first off chemical and

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
physical properties of the substrate

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,000
that they use so what are some of the

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,320
specifics and this again this is

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,198
in the very important materials in

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,359
methods

26
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,039
and we can see the total porosity uh

27
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,320
presented here plus or minus that

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,399
they're close

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,359
also of to make note of the growing

30
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,799
substrates

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,118
you see a u1-hp and just a u1

32
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,039
these are the different types of

33
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,239
substrates that they used they're both

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,600
based from a company out of canada so

35
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,319
again if you want to research those

36
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,640
further

37
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,719
these do provide you with the also the

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,759
ec it which stands for electrical

39
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,798
conductivity

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,478
ph and nutrient content here measured

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,560
so you can just see that for basic

42
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,519
properties of these two substrates that

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,478
are used in this

44
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,879
study now the response to cannabis yield

45
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,478
to

46
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,798
fertilizer so i think this is a very

47
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,879
important point to understand

48
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,118
is that they did use a fertilizer as a

49
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,478
nutri plus organic grow liquid

50
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,640
organic fertilizer a 4 1.3

51
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,679
1.7 that's a nitrogen phosphorus

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,320
potassium

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,000
and here's kind of their fertilizer rate

54
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,319
and their floral dry weight and i think

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,319
this is important for growers to realize

56
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,319
is that as they're increasing fertilizer

57
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,199
rate yes they did get an increase in

58
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,118
floral dry weight to a certain point

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,118
once you hit that kind of optimum level

60
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,799
as they kept adding or increase the

61
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:03,438
fertilizer rate you notice the floral

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,840
dry weight

63
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:09,840
of grams per plant did decrease

64
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,079
so after about 400 micrograms of

65
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,560
nitrogen per liter

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
we're noticing a decrease here in the

67
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,959
floral dry weight

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,439
now this is important for growers to

69
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,800
understand why here we are increasing

70
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,680
our cost

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,680
while also decreasing our yield not a

72
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
direction that is very profitable

73
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,959
so there is the optimum rate more is not

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,599
better

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,360
so what's the relationship between thc

76
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,560
and the dry flour and fertilizer

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
we're kind of seeing that same

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,598
relationship here more fertilizer is not

79
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,878
better it will actually reduce the

80
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,919
floral dry weight

81
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,518
and also not the mass but also the

82
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,000
percentage of thc

83
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,039
in this study the goal is to fertilize

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,360
this with the optimum

85
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,079
level and not get into the excessive

86
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
level

87
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,519
so we're the optimum rate here we can

88
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,759
see for this study where that lies

89
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,319
adding more is not going to produce more

90
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,759
contrary to a lot of growers think

91
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,280
so what are the researchers conclusions

92
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,399
based on the study well the optimum rate

93
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,400
for fertilizer for them

94
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,680
supplying based on the math that they

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,439
did was close to that 400 but that 389

96
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,200
milligrams of nitrogen per liter

97
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,199
for the fertilizer that they chose to

98
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,000
use in the vegetative growth stage of

99
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,318
cannabis using

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
aqua based organic substrates so again

101
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,199
very specific here but provide you with

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,598
a good starting point

103
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,199
and a good understanding hopefully that

104
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,639
over adding or adding more

105
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,479
nutrients than this level that was

106
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,079
suggested by the researchers will not

107
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,399
only decrease your

108
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
mass of dry weight but also decrease

109
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,039
your percentage of cannabinoids

110
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,039
potentially produced

111
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,719
so find that optimum rate fertilizer at

112
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,639
that rate don't add more

113
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,639
because you might end up getting less
