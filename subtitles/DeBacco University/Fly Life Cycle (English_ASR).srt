00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
welcome to this video here on tobacco

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,719
university looking at a fly

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
life cycle how it may relate to forensic

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,638
science

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,400
so the reason why we'd be interested in

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:13,359
insects particularly in relation to

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,040
forensics

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,879
is that they have a certain succession

9
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,399
or progression that they go through

10
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,160
so the progression of insects life

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,159
follows a pattern on cadavers

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,600
and development rates of flies are

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,679
relatively predictable

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,359
so the length of the life cycle varies

15
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,320
between different fly species and is

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,560
dependent on

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,238
temperature so that can help us kind of

18
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,719
backtrack or determine

19
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,238
how long that corpse has been there or

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
potentially the temperature

21
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,238
based on the insects that are present

22
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,759
typically flies lay eggs usually within

23
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,679
the first 24 hours

24
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,679
and then the predatory rove beetles or

25
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,878
parasites that feed on maggots will have

26
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,519
to wait until the

27
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,479
blowfly arrives and lay their eggs so

28
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,239
we're gonna focus a little bit on the

29
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,679
blowfly in particular here

30
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,839
beetles that specialize on bone will

31
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,920
have to wait until the bone is exposed

32
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840
so based on the insect species that

33
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,079
we're noticing or observing

34
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,039
that can help us kind of get a general

35
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,439
idea of the time

36
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,040
frame between very important when we're

37
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,599
looking at trying to determine

38
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
when the initial point of death occurred

39
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,559
now blowfi

40
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,000
metamorphosis so we kind of focus on

41
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,600
this just for a little bit

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,599
the blowflies are attracted to dead

43
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,359
bodies and often arrive within minutes

44
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,959
of the death of an animal

45
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,280
there are distinctive egg larval and

46
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,158
pupil adult stages which help estimate

47
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,519
the time of

48
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,439
death and this is where a good

49
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,640
entomologist a good person identifying

50
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,719
not only the insects

51
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,478
but the stage of development they're in

52
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,280
can help also provide a direct

53
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,478
correlation to

54
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,239
time so stage one looking at the eggs

55
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,159
all adult flies lay eggs on the

56
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,000
carcasses especially in the wound areas

57
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
or around openings in the body such as

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,920
nose eyes and ears

59
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
so to kind of be that very first stage

60
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,399
to be looking for early on

61
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
in the fly life cycle progressing on

62
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,239
then we have the larval stage is where

63
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,079
the eggs hatch into larvae or typically

64
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,759
referred to as maggots in the first 12

65
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,478
to approximately 24

66
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,000
hours continuing from there the larvae

67
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,000
continue to grow and they'll molt which

68
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,759
means they shed their exoskeleton

69
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,040
as they pass through the various n-star

70
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,719
stages an

71
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,560
star is a phase between two periods of

72
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,039
molting in the development of

73
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,318
an insect larvae or other invertible

74
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,359
organism

75
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,719
the first instar if you capture them and

76
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,400
preserve them you're looking at

77
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,080
you can determine that by being about

78
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,680
five millimeters long and that occurs

79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,280
after about 1.8 days

80
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,800
the second end star they'll progress to

81
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,800
about 10 millimeters long and

82
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,719
occur after about two and a half days

83
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
and the third and star will be about 14

84
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,199
to 16 millimeters long

85
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,439
this will occur after four to five days

86
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,079
now the pupa stage has stage number four

87
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,000
here the larva about 17 millimeters and

88
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
they develop into pupil after burrowing

89
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,318
into

90
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,920
surrounding soil so this is where we're

91
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,199
not only looking at the corpse but the

92
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,919
soil around that

93
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,439
can also play a very important factor

94
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,439
the adult stage that we're probably most

95
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,359
familiar with for the fly emerge from

96
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,639
the pupa cases and this occurs after

97
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,120
about six to eight

98
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,238
days and again probably most easily or

99
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,039
most common

100
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,599
for recognizing now looking at the

101
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,598
blowfly

102
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,280
in particular it has six parts the egg

103
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,318
the three larval stages the pupa and the

104
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,840
adult stage

105
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,518
and this kind of gives you an idea of

106
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,719
not in the progression but how long it

107
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,719
takes to go from one

108
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,239
area to another keep in mind this is at

109
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,158
70 degrees fahrenheit

110
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,759
each station of blowfire's life cycle

111
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,479
takes this known amount of time to

112
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,840
complete

113
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,199
and as they said temperature or

114
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,239
documenting that temperature having an

115
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,199
idea with that temperature

116
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,719
may have been in the area can impact the

117
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,318
time exactly

118
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,000
so important to take note of that as

119
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,719
well now this

120
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,199
metamorphosis process that can occur

121
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,120
well in flies and beetles and many other

122
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,639
insects have a complete metamorphosis

123
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,759
which consists of four stages

124
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,679
that egg larval and pupil to adult stage

125
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,598
so in these both metamorphosis stages

126
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,200
the insects begin to cycle as an egg and

127
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,560
complete the metamorphosis

128
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,039
and the insect passes through four

129
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
distinct phases which produce an adult

130
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,878
that does not resemble necessarily the

131
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,039
larval stage this is important to keep

132
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,959
note of this is why a good entomologist

133
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,519
is needed because it may look quite

134
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,598
different

135
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,438
squeeze these different transitions that

136
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,280
occur from that nymph to the adult by

137
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,438
molting the excess skeleton

138
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,598
whenever it becomes too tight in its

139
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,199
original casing there

140
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,199
so lastly just where you want to look

141
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,959
for these insects again if you're not an

142
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,560
extra entomologist just kind of an idea

143
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,238
of where to kind of look for

144
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,478
after the adults meet the females

145
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,560
usually lay eggs into the corpses that's

146
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,439
usually near natural body openings or

147
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,040
wounds

148
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,040
feeding activity is usually seen in the

149
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,759
head region first which is the mouth

150
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,879
nostrils eyes or ears this is followed

151
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,720
by the

152
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,120
expiratory and reproductive openings as

153
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
well the trunk of the body is invaded

154
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,720
much later in the process so that can

155
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,560
just give you a general idea

156
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,000
of when you're looking for those insects

157
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
where you may find them

158
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,680
just to give you a general idea of the

159
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,879
progression keep in mind of the type of

160
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,560
insect you're looking at

161
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,918
as well as the temperature in the area

162
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,319
because all that will have an

163
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,319
influence and be able to try to pinpoint

164
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:59,759
with the greatest degree of accuracy

165
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,759
the original time of death
