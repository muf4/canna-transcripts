1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,949
okay here we will get pregnancy

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,269
childbirth and development of

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:09,240
individuals so you can gain a greater

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:12,689
appreciation for what occurred early on

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,400
in your life starting with the placenta

6
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,259
so this is before you're born you had

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,210
this connection to your mother this

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,760
connection is the placenta through the

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,618
umbilical cord the placenta itself is a

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,900
flat and circular organ in the uterus

11
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:27,599
pregnant mammals it provides nourishment

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,788
it maintains the fetus through the

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,980
connection of the umbilical cord what's

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,570
occurring in this connection is between

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,939
the fetus and the mother is carbon

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,738
dioxide urea and hormones that are

17
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,079
generated in the fetus of being

18
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:41,689
exchanged with the mother as a result

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,939
the faeces acquiring from the mother

20
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:47,609
nutrients oxygen antibodies vitamins and

21
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:49,170
water you see a lot of arteries and

22
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:50,460
veins here because a lot of nutrient

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,800
exchanges that are occurred

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,719
reason why it's gaining oxygen from the

25
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,179
mother and giving carbon dioxide the

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,280
piece itself can not directly exchange

27
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,509
the gases with the outside world it

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,789
needs to have this connection to the

29
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:07,310
mother to be able to allow that process

30
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:09,390
to occur now physiological changes for

31
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,368
expecting mothers in their effects

32
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,618
during pregnancy will be variable based

33
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,920
on the individuals however there's some

34
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,868
key areas that will notice a change

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,090
because of the unborn child as it grows

36
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:24,329
and develops one in particular is the GI

37
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,920
tract gastrointestinal tract some

38
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,140
mothers will experience morning sickness

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,049
this is due to elevated levels of

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,109
estrogen and progesterone urinary system

41
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,509
our urine production --all increase to

42
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,430
handle the additional fetal wastes in

43
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,450
the respiratory system and expect the

44
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,040
expected mother could have shortness of

45
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,960
breath or difficulty breathing

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,990
so because her diaphragm may not be able

47
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,599
to fully expand because of the growing

48
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,819
fetus cardiovascular system the mother

49
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,669
will have blood on increase about 25 to

50
00:01:53,819 --> 00:02:00,029
40 percent because of now it's needs to

51
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,310
also exchange the blood of the unborn

52
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,239
child it also be headaches

53
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,819
there can be muscle pain leg pain lower

54
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:12,120
back pain all these can occur it will

55
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,009
vary with you one mother in another

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,509
now stages of childbirth estrogen

57
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,399
reaches peak during the last weeks of

58
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:19,318
pregnancy this is from the onset of

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,620
labor until the cervix is fully dilated

60
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,238
about which is about 10 centimeters

61
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,378
initial contractions are about 15 to 30

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,539
minutes apart

63
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:30,419
and lasts for about ten to thirty

64
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,639
seconds in duration strong contractions

65
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,378
are defined as ones that occur every two

66
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,449
to three minutes and lasts for about one

67
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:39,209
minute keep in mind this is a child

68
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:42,298
entire childbirth process is a positive

69
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:45,209
feedback loop and after the child is

70
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:47,760
delivered the placenta is delivered

71
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,019
within about thirty minutes of birth and

72
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,669
it termed the afterbirth

73
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,370
so placenta we were talking about looks

74
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:55,859
like this very read it's highly vascular

75
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,890
occur there's a lot of those nutrients

76
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,989
to be exchanged between the mother and

77
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:04,500
at the point of being in uterus the

78
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:07,829
unborn baby now upon birth is an Apgar

79
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,719
score that's given every about one of

80
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,400
the five minutes after birth an infant's

81
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,400
physical status is assessed on these

82
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,579
five characteristics I'm just giving a

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,950
quick 0 to 2 score and Apgar score of

84
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,889
about 8 to 10 indicates a healthy baby

85
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:25,169
lower scores reveal problems so for

86
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,060
example the pulse is taken pulse rate

87
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,358
it's greater than 100 that's giving it

88
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,519
to if it's between 60 but less than 100

89
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:35,939
is given a 1 it's less than 60 that'd be

90
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,639
a zero at the area for concern but also

91
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,129
be looking at for example activity is

92
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,049
there active movement of the recently

93
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,269
born babies or some fluctuation is there

94
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:49,859
none and you can see here it's a quick

95
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:53,189
way to be able to assess the baby's

96
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:55,260
physical status post al development

97
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,060
babies are typically double in birth

98
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,340
weight within a few months different

99
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,639
body parts grow at different rates it's

100
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,348
in allometric growth what's important is

101
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,349
that early on nerve cells are producing

102
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:11,098
an average of greater than 250,000 per

103
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:14,039
minute however at 6 months neuron

104
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:15,479
production ceases permanently so this is

105
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,779
why it's important you don't damage your

106
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:21,029
nervous system is beyond 6 months the

107
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,009
nerves cells that you have you'll have

108
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,909
for the rest of your life your body does

109
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:27,899
not make more or repair connections

110
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,729
lastly of our stages of child

111
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,000
development so we have our infant and

112
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:34,168
babies defined a zero to two years old

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
toddlers or preschoolers or two to five

114
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:38,908
years old these are were meltdowns are

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,860
very common it just seemed totally seems

116
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:42,360
like they always say no you have to

117
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,699
learn how to accept no from others in

118
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,990
this can be a very challenging time

119
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,060
school-age children ages six to twelve

120
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,829
generally are getting more independence

121
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,269
process learning and making good choices

122
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:56,939
and hopefully in developing or setting

123
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:59,279
the stage for good life skills at lesson

124
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,529
sir teenagers are 13 18 year old years

125
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,918
old and this is the time that begins

126
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:07,079
defining oneself and realistically kind

127
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:10,529
of putting the future and talents become

128
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,538
refined so even though many students

129
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:14,579
kind of fall in that 13 18 adolescence

130
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:17,038
through teenager years it seems like

131
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:19,439
they may have behaviors of toddler or

132
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,939
preschoolers at times even though they

133
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,589
should be focused on kind of

134
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:25,680
realistically planning for the future

135
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:28,439
and hopefully I'll be finding their

136
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,459
talents or skills so they can continue

137
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:36,149
those beyond 18 years old and being able

138
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:38,489
to develop an interest and carry that on

139
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:41,239
for the rest of your life in maintaining

140
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,240
that interest
