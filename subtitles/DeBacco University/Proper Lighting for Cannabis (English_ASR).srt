1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
okay so here I'm gonna go over proper

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,660
lighting for cannabis and how the

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:09,330
different stages can have different

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,650
light requirements so the general light

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,679
requirements looking at the Gro stage

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,278
clones typically will be a little bit

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,890
less par or PPF the ratings and a

8
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,990
seedling something because of the stress

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,480
that they're going under now keep in

10
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,919
mind that there is a range provided here

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,320
and that can depend on other factors

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,080
such as temperature and humidity and

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,460
just general growing conditions but

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,170
something to shoot for for clones is one

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,689
or two hundred seventy just a little bit

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,429
higher than two hundred ceilings one two

17
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:40,589
three hundred two people want to keep

18
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,988
them not getting leggy want to keep them

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,480
nice and robust so that's a good range

20
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:48,179
to shoot for vegetative we're increasing

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,648
kind of from that 300 to get high is six

22
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,600
hundred and we're pushing them into

23
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,149
flower that kind of end finisher they're

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,230
looking for six hundred plus so these

25
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,399
are kind of just general light

26
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,988
requirements and gives you just

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,379
something to shoot for or it gives you

28
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:03,179
an idea of a range of what the canvas

29
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,609
plant needs at different stages of

30
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,049
growth now

31
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:08,670
herbs will ask well should I add side

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,200
lights you know a man I'm looking at a

33
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,368
lot of lights on the ceiling and putting

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,380
down shared side lights

35
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,750
well we've reflective walls are advised

36
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,339
and while silent may not hurt the actual

37
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,569
effectiveness may not be worth the

38
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,950
additional cost over over plant lighting

39
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,868
is the most efficient it should be the

40
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,490
focus along with the quality reflector

41
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:28,590
that you're using a little less

42
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:31,949
importance on side lights the reflective

43
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,170
wall service is advised those room walls

44
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,820
as much attention is painted reflectors

45
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,219
do not forget the walls of a grow room

46
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,798
except Falls can add light that would

47
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,539
otherwise be lost or wasted typically

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,299
reflective material be like mylar which

49
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,740
is about 92 to 97 percent of it with

50
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,350
reflect ability and rest Oleum 28:51 40

51
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,969
ultra matte interior chopped pink that's

52
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,769
kind of his white paint is something

53
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,709
else to consider if you're looking at

54
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:01,560
the need to paint the walls of a grow

55
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:03,059
room lights can play favorites so even

56
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,920
lighting is the goal but sometimes is it

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,509
not possible so may be necessary to

58
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,580
rotate plans to ensure the receiving

59
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,080
evenly disbursed light so kind of use

60
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,150
that here's our salad what we do add to

61
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,900
your salad well some people might pick

62
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,760
more of one thing then

63
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,260
there so they can kind of play favorites

64
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,509
so keep in mind if you see a plant

65
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:21,548
leaning over the one way I want to just

66
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:23,199
rotate that plant 90 degrees so it's

67
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:26,650
just getting an even amount of light and

68
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:29,289
not going to have a hard time kind of

69
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,519
pruning that or trellising that or

70
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:33,158
getting that plant to grow in the way

71
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,408
you want it you want to maximize light

72
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:37,989
so while it's not advised if you are in

73
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:40,000
a grow room where space is an issue they

74
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:41,950
used to light the perimeter from a high

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,049
intensity light you place clones or

76
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:46,389
seedlings as this grower has here it's

77
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,219
like a diffused light of lights that

78
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:50,589
you're already running as you can see

79
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:53,229
here the candle as you get further away

80
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,519
get more diffused light however if

81
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:56,469
possible you want to avoid this scenario

82
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,719
because it can involve mixing plants in

83
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:00,189
different areas in different ages which

84
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,199
can potentially infect plants with

85
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:05,139
disease or cross contaminate with

86
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:07,449
insects so again this can it be done

87
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:08,708
sure is it advised typically when I keep

88
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:11,889
your clothes the seedlings in an

89
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,900
isolated separate location plant spacing

90
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,878
overcrowding will reduce yields and lead

91
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,109
to an increased chance for disease the

92
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:19,060
goal is to only have the tips of two

93
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:20,709
plants touching to ensure maximum plant

94
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,019
density while still providing the

95
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,459
opportunity for good air circulation

96
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,409
this is why lights can determine the

97
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:28,120
area or the gross space that you have

98
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:29,799
this shows a little bit of the ideal

99
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,450
situation here where just the tips are

100
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,010
touching you can see what one plant may

101
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:34,988
have been moved you can see how that

102
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:36,548
looks like a gap here this is a little

103
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,289
bit too dense here we're seeing kind of

104
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,790
leaves in topple leaves it's kind of

105
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:42,759
reducing the amount of light that can

106
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:44,048
penetrate this canopy lastly there's

107
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,539
this thing called light stress some

108
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,010
glower some growers will give plants 36

109
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:50,560
hours of continuous darkness before

110
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:52,239
inducing flowering they claim quicker

111
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,030
time to flower however this isn't

112
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,819
unnecessary stress and I do not advise

113
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,189
this 36 hours of darkness simply move

114
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:02,979
the plants over to the grow room you can

115
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:05,439
flip the lights to 12 hours and 12 even

116
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:07,060
12 and 12 you don't think this 36 hours

117
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,489
at enthuse darkest that's unneeded

118
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,289
stress on those plants so for this

119
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,209
provide you just a good idea of the

120
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,918
proper lighting for cannabis and the

121
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,538
general requirements at the different

122
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,538
stages provided for you there
