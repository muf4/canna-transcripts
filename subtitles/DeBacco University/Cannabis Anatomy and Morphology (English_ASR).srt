1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
you want to look at some of the physical

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,509
attributes of cannabis with the anatomy

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,539
and morphology to basically fern to what

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,099
you can physically see here now the

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:14,308
terms in [ __ ] and morphology are

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,259
basically interchangeable anatomy is the

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:17,759
basic structure of an organism in

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,580
morphology is the relationship of the

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,720
organism and their structure so we're

10
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:23,608
not going to really spend too much time

11
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,198
on any of the specifics so for our

12
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,779
purposes these are basically

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,189
interchangeable terms we're looking at

14
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,768
the relation of the structures in the

15
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,600
function here major structures are

16
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:36,299
presented as titles and the functions

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,429
are provided in the descriptions so

18
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,378
starting with the chute in root systems

19
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:41,878
the plant morphology pertains to the

20
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:44,009
vegetative structures and the

21
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,449
reproductive structures use two main

22
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,058
systems the chute which is the upper

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,100
system here as what we mainly see or

24
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,468
associate with the plant and that can be

25
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,840
the nodes the inter nose the buds the

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,570
leaves we have the root system down here

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,579
which supports the upper growing portion

28
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,299
now there's a lot over it's there's tap

29
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,228
roots and also very important root hairs

30
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:05,640
starting with the roots here they're

31
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:08,310
responsible for absorbing water and

32
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,460
minerals we see a bunch of roots unit in

33
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,439
a propagator they're also important for

34
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,569
anchoring the plant to allow for upright

35
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,269
growth and they store food that is

36
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,548
synthesized in the leaves so roots have

37
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,560
a very important function despite them

38
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,680
mostly being below ground and oftentimes

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,629
not seen by growers the steps are

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,939
support the near structures that support

41
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,039
the leaves and they allow the leaves to

42
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,559
take the best advantage on capturing

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,090
light energy they also conduct water and

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,549
minerals absorbed by the roots in the

45
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,290
leaves and they can also store food and

46
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,930
water in their tissues we see kind of a

47
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,659
cutaway section in here and these in

48
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,520
that stem structure may differ depending

49
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,618
on what portion of the plant you're

50
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,679
talking about or how old that tissue may

51
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:55,078
be meristem the regions of sites at high

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,659
cell division the apical meristem are

53
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,319
the shoot meristem located at the top of

54
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,780
the plant

55
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,000
so we see an apical meristem here here

56
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,368
you see all of our meristematic tissues

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,140
of the shoots appear this most likely be

58
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:09,479
the apical if you're growing a plant in

59
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,699
one single way eyes could be laterals

60
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,890
here based on the different pruning

61
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,479
methods keep in mind there's also mer

62
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,919
stems in the roots and they occur to

63
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:21,269
very tips of the ever growing roots

64
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,759
here's a quick stem anatomy we have our

65
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,040
nodes which are a site here where our

66
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,479
leaves attached ideals attached then our

67
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,909
inter notes and that's the distance

68
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,159
between those two nodes some growth we

69
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:34,889
talked about keeping short Internode's

70
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,799
and that's keeping the area here or the

71
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,449
amount of stem between your leaves where

72
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,430
they attach to the stem as short as

73
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:43,500
possible this can be important for a

74
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,840
variety of reasons plants that have a

75
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,739
long Internode's tend to be very wispy

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,719
and can break easily the leaf structure

77
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,580
arm is possible for capturing light to

78
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,680
aid in the production of food or sugars

79
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,510
in the plant you can see here a nice

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,370
leaf structure in a pretty dense canopy

81
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:04,919
within there or supporting those leaves

82
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,230
we have a vascular tissue that is occurs

83
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,699
in the stems and also the leaves they

84
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,768
transport water and nutrients to the

85
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,869
plant and they act as a circulatory

86
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,459
system for the plant there's two main

87
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,659
components and they're located in here

88
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,090
they're highlighted here we have our

89
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,859
xylem which is more interior and that's

90
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,269
conducting water and dissolved nutrients

91
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,100
from the roots and upper portions in the

92
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,110
plant we have our phloem which is

93
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,509
conducting cells transporting sugar and

94
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,570
other plant products up and down the

95
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:33,569
plant so xylem is water only in the

96
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:36,560
upward direction phloem is moving food

97
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,819
up and down and throughout the plant

98
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,890
lastly we have flowers of their

99
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,049
reproductive organs that produce seeds

100
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,849
that will become the next generation

101
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,950
plants flowers of course of the site

102
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:49,079
seed production however in cannabis

103
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,869
often the goal is not to produce seeds

104
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:56,189
but the chemical compounds such as CBTs

105
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:59,759
or in other cases THC or flavonoids or

106
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,650
terpenes these flowers here are not

107
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,078
producing seeds going through the

108
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,519
process of cannabis most growers are not

109
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,530
looking to produce seeds they're more

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,549
interested in the chemical compounds

111
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,549
that the plant can produce
