1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
okay here we can be looking the effects

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,169
of UV or ultraviolet radiation on plant

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,910
contents so why maybe from those UV

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:11,370
radiation of being something to be of

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,070
caution to and that is important it also

6
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:15,570
can be used to kind of reveal certain

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,910
things when we're looking at developing

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,070
money that's hard to counterfeit and it

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,778
can make certain liquids glow but it is

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,250
some things you need radiation is

11
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:24,929
something to be concerned about and

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,528
typically we'll see that associated with

13
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:32,939
sunglasses so UV light there's different

14
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:34,920
forms UVC UVB and UVA UVA is account

15
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,289
about 95 percent of the UV radiation

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,539
reaching the Earth's surface while UV

17
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,460
beza Chief's caused her skin reddening

18
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,589
and sunburn intensive damage the skins

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,320
more superficial epidermal layer so

20
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,809
that's the outer portion UVC is filtered

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,730
out by the ozone in the stratosphere so

22
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,948
these are in addition to visible light

23
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,390
as we see here there's uva UVB can see

24
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:56,640
the different wavelengths it's a good

25
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,030
occurring that you VA can penetrate

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,710
deeper into our skin than UVB which

27
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,890
tends to stay more in the epidermal

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,769
layer closer to our skin surface now

29
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,228
what's being shown here is that lettuce

30
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,298
is affected by UV light production so

31
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:13,530
growing the right type of green leaf

32
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,180
lettuce during the winter in a

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,009
greenhouse and exposing it to the right

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,110
type of ultraviolet light can boost

35
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,549
levels nutritionally of carotenoids

36
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,420
according to the Agricultural Research

37
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,950
Service so supplementing uva plus UVB

38
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,079
greatly increased the carotenoid and

39
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,270
chlorophyll concentrations in green leaf

40
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,090
lettuce varieties so here's one example

41
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,789
how adjusting the light can affect the

42
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,340
outcome of the plant this master's

43
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,680
thesis also looked at lettuce production

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,228
this thesis was published in the year

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,610
2016 they showed that the use of

46
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,959
supplemental light to improve the

47
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,310
quality of red lettuce is common

48
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,109
practice in today's greenhouse

49
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,118
production and the use of UV light

50
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,828
treatments leads to an increase in the

51
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,118
synthesis of health growing compounds

52
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:59,069
for phenolic acids in flavonoids there's

53
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,468
just another example of light affecting

54
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:02,489
the outcome now since we relate this to

55
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:03,809
cannabis here

56
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,519
the importance of you delight in

57
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,710
trichome development so in canvas

58
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,500
increasing UVB radiation resulted in

59
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:12,659
increased THC levels in the flowers it's

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,949
just referred to the study here ta

61
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,199
cheaters being a cannabinoid

62
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,839
maybe something like this could be also

63
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,609
be applied to CBD production trichomes

64
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,189
can block harmful UVB rays from reaching

65
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,530
the sensitive photosynthetic tissues of

66
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:27,598
the leaves as a result these trichomes

67
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,209
that are being produced increased

68
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,459
numbers I thought the function almost is

69
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,739
like a shading effect or a sunblock for

70
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,020
the plants some way to melanin protects

71
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,939
the skin from UVB damage in this case

72
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,489
plants are producing higher trichomes

73
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,189
which in return are producing higher

74
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:47,400
cannabinoids so then the plants that

75
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:49,079
were giving the artificial light to when

76
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,209
we may want to be considering lights

77
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,980
that produce the UV light part of the

78
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,360
spectrum to help increase the

79
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,359
cannabinoids that they can produce
