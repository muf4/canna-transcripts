1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,190
okay continuing with the macromolecule

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,528
of lipids we're look specifically here

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,809
at steroids in cholesterol and how they

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:11,969
relate to the body so starting first

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,308
with steroids are composed of four rings

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:18,329
of carbon as we see them labeled here a

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:21,118
B C and D examples are cholesterol found

8
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:23,969
in most animal cell membranes and female

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,518
and male sex hormones are also fall into

10
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:28,948
the category of steroids which is one of

11
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:33,109
the three forms of lipids keep in mind

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,550
the other two our fats and phospholipids

13
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:37,619
so looking specifically at cluster all

14
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:40,500
here it's a fatty substance found only

15
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,659
in animal foods it's also produced by

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,789
our bodies small amounts are needed by

17
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,139
the body for essential functions so we

18
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,660
want to think that cholesterol is

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,090
entirely a bad thing the small nuts are

20
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,738
still needed by the body where the issue

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,840
comes in is where we have excessive

22
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,729
amounts of cholesterol and it can form

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,890
this fatty plaque which sticks to the

24
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,319
inside of our arteries and this can

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,480
cause heart disease so we need our red

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,728
blood cells to easily flow through our

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,158
veins and our arteries here we have this

28
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,228
build with these plaques now think about

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,359
if we have blood flow going through here

30
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:14,670
everything that's well inside however if

31
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,159
we restrict it down to here you can have

32
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,530
some serious issues so we get heart

33
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,340
attacks where's heart disease by even

34
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,349
extreme cases death can occur

35
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:28,079
now cholesterol we have HDL which is

36
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:31,319
considered good cholesterol and LDL tis

37
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:34,500
considered bad cholesterol so LDL stands

38
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,239
for low density lipoproteins his carries

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,438
cholesterol around in the blood and it

40
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,780
confirmed those plaques they talked

41
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,158
about in your arteries as a result that

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,939
can increase the risk for heart disease

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,710
so negative things with the LDL pathway

44
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,148
here

45
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:49,669
HDL so considered the good cholesterol

46
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,849
so these are the high density

47
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,560
lipoproteins in these carry cholesterol

48
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:57,839
to the liver and also out of the body

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,840
for processing so the liver can process

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
it synthesized by the liver picks up

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,520
cluster on the tissues and can allow it

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,580
to be excreted from the body this helps

53
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,288
avoid plaques and heart disease so when

54
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,629
we talk about cholesterol the broad term

55
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,969
please realize if there's low density

56
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:16,099
and high density

57
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:18,319
while forms of cholesterol any

58
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,359
high-density consider the beneficial

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,879
ones for the body while the lower LDL

60
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,940
the low-density lipoproteins have

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,579
negative effects

62
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,889
now trick try glyceride level in the

63
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,730
blood is a fat that circulates the blood

64
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:38,029
it increases risk of heart disease it

65
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:39,739
looks like once if you melted butter

66
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,050
stick with four fists gallon of water

67
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,230
produce a milky kind of looking liquid

68
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,620
so these triglycerides have that kind of

69
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:51,310
milky look to them now having none of

70
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,469
them is not necessarily the goal under

71
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,830
150 milligrams per deciliter is the

72
00:02:54,469 --> 00:03:00,800
normal or level of low concern

73
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:03,440
borderline high is 150 to 199 C high in

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,740
very high levels so having a certain

75
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:09,020
amount is in sidered normal but when we

76
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,360
start getting into higher numbers that's

77
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,159
where we may get concerned in the reason

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,250
why we typically have blood work done to

79
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,049
be able to assess of these levels now as

80
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,900
a result our normal blood levels of

81
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,330
total cholesterol sort of kind of

82
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,989
shooting for that under 200 borderline

83
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,640
is over over 200 to 239 and high risk is

84
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,860
over 240 and it's milligrams per

85
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,539
deciliter we can break down that

86
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,790
cholesterol instead of just that total

87
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:38,179
we can look at the high density and low

88
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:39,560
density in the triglyceride level so

89
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,510
remember the high densities are the

90
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,019
beneficial ones we want to see that

91
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:45,289
number

92
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:48,080
ideally 60 or above LDL want to be under

93
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:49,849
100 and triglycerides under 150 would be

94
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,620
the goal this is why we get blood work

95
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:53,569
done that reason why there might be

96
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,659
these ranges or these gold amounts is

97
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:58,539
we're trying to stay within that

98
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:02,239
accepted kind of average or normal

99
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:03,650
levels of distribution that isn't true

100
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,299
for everyone and they may be changing

101
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,159
some of these levels but it gives you

102
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,739
just an idea of that total cholesterol

103
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,629
under 200 but breaking it down further

104
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,819
into the different types of cholesterol

105
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:17,839
so hopefully get a better understanding

106
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:19,939
for the difference between these two now

107
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:24,009
risk factors occur low so if you do have

108
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:27,019
a family history of high low density

109
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:28,360
lipoproteins which is sorry negative

110
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,039
cluster

111
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,220
there can be increased by if you're

112
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,800
overweight and obesity your diet can

113
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,230
also impact that your sedentary

114
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,230
lifestyle your family tree or history

115
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,270
you're a cigarette smoker hypertension

116
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,030
diabetes type 2 can also contribute to

117
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:48,609
this especially the combination of these

118
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:51,399
factors can really increase the odds of

119
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,020
you having a cholesterol problem so if

120
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,579
you have a family history and a

121
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:57,250
sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy

122
00:04:54,579 --> 00:05:00,060
diet that can really help contribute to

123
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:03,120
developing this high cholesterol and

124
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,829
negative effects seen by the body

125
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,000
management or eating a healthy diet

126
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:09,969
exercising keeping weight in the normal

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,910
range hyper sensitive diabetics better

128
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,320
control don't smoke and get your

129
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,990
cholesterol checked at least once a year

130
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,689
if you have risk factors so just various

131
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,480
good practices in general in both diet

132
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:24,250
and in health that helps you be able to

133
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,390
manage if you are at risk for

134
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:30,040
cholesterol lastly exercise what we

135
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,649
considered exercise will can help boost

136
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,140
your HDL or good cholesterol this

137
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:37,089
reduces the risk of heart disease helps

138
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,039
control your weight and helps control

139
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:40,629
diabetes and hypertension and I say

140
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,910
exercise it doesn't just run up the

141
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:45,159
stairs this exercise for at least 30

142
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,050
minutes daily you can choose from a

143
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,120
variety of exercise it should help to

144
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,590
enjoy and you can keep it up so don't

145
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,290
pick something that you can have to do

146
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:55,419
try to incorporate 30 minutes some form

147
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,580
of exercise daily that you might enjoy

148
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,020
doing so for some people that's running

149
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:01,240
for some people that could be swimming

150
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:03,549
that could be jogging find something

151
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,780
that works for you this exercise here is

152
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,230
defined as 30 minutes of daily active

153
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:10,229
work
