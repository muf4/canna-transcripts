1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:05,639
here we're gonna look at the process of

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:07,410
translation now here will may be

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,419
translating one language into another

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,638
language back into the original language

5
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,980
yeah we're gonna look at translation in

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:17,789
this lecture series is going to be

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,130
converting our mRNA sequence into an

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,250
actual protein so let's get into it

9
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,960
so if we're talk about translation if

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,599
transcription and this refers back to

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,760
the central dogma of biology we're

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,700
looking at DNA being replicated and

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,230
transcribed and translated transcribe or

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,739
just like we see here someone typing on

15
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:41,759
an old typewriter is the process of

16
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:44,549
taking DNA and transcribing it into RNA

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,189
this is a process through RNA polymerase

18
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:49,378
it binds to one DNA strand at the site

19
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,759
called a promoter region so the promoter

20
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,939
region is kind of the initial like

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,769
region it moves along the DNA pairing

22
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,259
complementary nucleotides and then

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,699
disintegrates at the stop signal so we

24
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,808
see here here's our DNA or

25
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,210
double-stranded DNA

26
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:07,408
looking at the sense strand and here's

27
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,719
our mRNA and our RNA polymerase in this

28
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,600
region or taking a double stranded

29
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:16,500
region taking one particular sequence

30
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:19,140
here and we are now producing an mRNA

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,239
sequence that will then be used in the

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,430
next process so this process of

33
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,810
transcription the promoter regions where

34
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,079
it's starting and we're transcribing our

35
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:35,879
DNA into our mRNA and again keep in mind

36
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:39,719
D RNA DNA contains thymine and RNA will

37
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:41,759
contain uracil so you need to actual

38
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,679
translation what is this it's converting

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,829
the order of nucleotides of a gene into

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,020
the order of amino acids in the protein

41
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:51,599
Emma RNAs are the blueprint or copies of

42
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,489
the nuclear genes mRNAs are read by the

43
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,048
ribosomes in three nucleotide units

44
00:01:53,489 --> 00:02:00,390
called codons each 3 nucleotide sequence

45
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,939
codes for an amino acid or a stop signal

46
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,509
so let's look at this again here here's

47
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:10,618
our DNA we're transcribing our DNA to

48
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:13,318
our RNA and we're translating our RNA to

49
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:15,568
our actual amino acid sequence that will

50
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,158
simply generate our proteins keep in

51
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,679
mind these codons are these three coding

52
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:22,229
regions and we don't read necessary each

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,849
individual nucleotide one at a time they

54
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,128
actually look at them in groups of three

55
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:32,060
in these codons are what's referred to

56
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:34,438
as generating the particular amino acid

57
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,329
so you can see here our episomes

58
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:38,729
these are the protein making factories

59
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:42,629
of the cell these have a large and a

60
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:45,060
small subunit these mRNA to direct

61
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:47,729
assembly of a protein and a ribosome is

62
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,128
made up of two subunits each composed of

63
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:53,729
our RNA so if you want to go back and

64
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:55,500
refer to the types of RNA lecture you're

65
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:57,328
more and welcome to is a lot of that

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,878
comes back and is involved here you

67
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:02,430
could see our T RNA sequences our mRNA

68
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:04,620
and this ribosome is made mostly by wait

69
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,669
at least of our RNA which is ribosomal

70
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,500
RNA now the basic process of making a

71
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:13,139
protein the mRNA binds to a smaller

72
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,000
episomes subunit the large subunit joins

73
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:16,919
the complex forming a complete ribosome

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,780
no doubt large and that small subunit

75
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,540
joined together and that little gap in

76
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,039
between there the mRNA is the mRNA

77
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,168
threads through the ribosome producing

78
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,900
the Polytech peptide remember

79
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,269
polypeptide polypeptide mini peptide

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,400
bonds peptide bonds will hold or link

81
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,530
the amino acids together and a

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,639
collection of amino acids will form

83
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,459
hopefully a functional protein so

84
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,560
transfer RNA these bring amino acids to

85
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,658
the ribosome they are anticodon region

86
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,848
binding to the mRNA these three base

87
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,620
pairs and at the three prime end here

88
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:51,530
where the hydroxyl group is where the is

89
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,938
where the amino acid would be attached

90
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,709
they have the anticodon region again

91
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:57,539
bind to the mRNA and the three prime Oh

92
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,878
H is where the amino acid will be

93
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:02,158
attached and it does look like a basic T

94
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,328
type structure that forgets the name

95
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,489
transfer RNA

96
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:09,209
so as a transferring but it also has a T

97
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:11,968
like shape the normal process here's our

98
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,430
DNA transcription transcribed to our RNA

99
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:16,500
translated to a protein these large

100
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,009
letters capital letters represent

101
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,598
different amino acids now the genetic

102
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:24,270
code converting a codon to an amino acid

103
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:26,908
so important to know how to read and

104
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,318
produce the proper amino acids giving

105
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:30,839
the

106
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,949
so remember these are current threes so

107
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,649
you want to take the first letter and

108
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:37,460
use this column here so we'll just say

109
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:39,989
for example the first letter was an a

110
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:42,329
that's gonna put you into this row here

111
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,160
now when the second letter let's say it

112
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:45,810
was are you so we're in this row you

113
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,939
will put us in this column with the

114
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,089
intersects or in this box right here and

115
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:54,829
the third letter if it was a G we're

116
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:58,228
gonna be in this row and this column and

117
00:04:54,829 --> 00:05:02,639
in this specific box here so it would be

118
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:07,379
Aug would be this C start codon here we

119
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:10,949
notice if our codon was UGA we would go

120
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:12,870
you would find G we'd find a and we see

121
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,930
that corresponds that they stop codon

122
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:20,728
located here now it could also be you a

123
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:23,370
a you hey hey that also be a stop codon

124
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:26,879
and you AG wouldn't need another stop

125
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:29,189
codon so there are some redundancies it

126
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:33,120
see here's a bunch that also represent

127
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:36,300
on the same amino acid and on certain

128
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,699
cases in technically rare cases we have

129
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,530
some that encode for only one amino acid

130
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,810
or only a couple and code for the same

131
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:45,569
amino acid not as many redundancies

132
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,899
there this is a typical square or box

133
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:51,149
type this also is a very similar type

134
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:52,948
it's the same a different icon it's in a

135
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:56,069
circular format here you'd start with

136
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:58,408
the first letter in the middle and you'd

137
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:01,610
work your way out so if you remember

138
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:05,579
back here some of our stop codons you AG

139
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:09,419
you to a to G and this black circle

140
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:13,228
means it's a stop codon our start codon

141
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:15,779
was Aug so we want to find our a for our

142
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:17,699
first letter here's our you and here's

143
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:19,228
our g there's our start comeback

144
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,879
so you can see it reads basically the

145
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:24,959
same way just presented in this a

146
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:27,620
different form the basic process of our

147
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:31,589
transcription remember our DNA we're

148
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:34,740
transcribing it to form our mRNA mRNA

149
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:37,168
gets translated into a basically amino

150
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,590
acid sequence using the protein same

151
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:41,698
basic process

152
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:42,659
so necessary components for our

153
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,819
translation

154
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,710
remember that's mrna to a protein we

155
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,470
need a ribosomes with your tRNA we need

156
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:51,089
our mRNA remember here's our anticodon

157
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,380
region here would be our you know acid

158
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,719
which would be very specific to that

159
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,490
particular codon and this would be our

160
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,139
ribosome here or basically the

161
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,560
protective structures allowing this

162
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,788
process to occur

163
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,110
now ribosome somebody's attached and

164
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:07,379
start the translation process we could

165
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,389
see here MMA team it is our start codon

166
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:12,409
tRNA carrying the first amino acid is

167
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:15,629
paired with the start codon of the mRNA

168
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,820
there's an a site AP site in an e site

169
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:20,098
the e site holds the tRNA carrying to

170
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,649
the next amino acid sequence so a is

171
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:24,360
kind of the start p site holds at ni

172
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,909
carrying the grinning amino acid chain

173
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,280
it's middle and east site is where the

174
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,479
tearing exits so a good thing is the

175
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,109
first letter in the alphabet where it

176
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,519
starts P site is kind of the middle one

177
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,259
each site is where it's exiting so

178
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,408
here's our a or P and this would be our

179
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:42,060
East site here exiting out the tRNA keep

180
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:44,339
in mind that TNA is exiting it no longer

181
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,379
has an amino acid attached to it because

182
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,788
it added it to the polypeptide chain it

183
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,209
has to go out and find another amino

184
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:52,709
acid in line to it

185
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:55,079
oonh acids are joined by a peptide bond

186
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:57,538
those proteins are polypeptides made of

187
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,418
many peptide bonds they're linked

188
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:02,819
together with this bond and in the first

189
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:05,069
trna is released it is now missing the

190
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,288
amino acid and has to go back and find

191
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:09,689
that you know acid were combined and

192
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:11,610
come back again we see the same basic

193
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,689
picture presented slightly differently

194
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,430
so you can hopefully see the

195
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:15,959
similarities and see the differences or

196
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,500
being develop a better understanding of

197
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,180
this process process continues to

198
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,709
ribosome contingent on the mRNA until

199
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,090
the second tier anaise and the P site

200
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:26,250
and this allows the process to continue

201
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:28,198
we have this communal binding this

202
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,728
linking is kicking out coming back

203
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,930
repeat repeat repeat down the whole

204
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:35,490
messenger RNA sequence through growing

205
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:38,370
peptide chain if you notice the ribosome

206
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,930
moves along the mRNA and amino acids are

207
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,278
continually added to the ever growing

208
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:46,169
polypeptide chain the stop codon

209
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:47,939
detaches the polypeptide sequence in the

210
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:50,129
last two nights release resulting in the

211
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,380
dissociation of the ribosome subunits

212
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:55,019
what that means we see is the same ball

213
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:57,090
here but if we look back and remember at

214
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,919
some of our previous images there's

215
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,580
actually two subunits from our large and

216
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:04,740
subunit and that basically stop region

217
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,980
is causing these to fall apart and when

218
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,710
they fall apart they release the linear

219
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,899
chain of amino acids it's a peptide

220
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:17,850
chain where can hopefully go folds to

221
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:19,919
perform a functional protein kind of

222
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,659
translation process summary again it's

223
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,479
the same thing we have our initiation

224
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:27,839
step we have elongation step basically

225
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,940
bring it that chain over here with our

226
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,970
termination step our release factor your

227
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,560
Aug set stop codon and then the parts

228
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,139
are recycled so just because these

229
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,869
immunity these amino acids are growing

230
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:42,299
here and just because all of a sudden

231
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,700
our two are RNAs or two ribosomal

232
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:47,069
subunits dissociate doesn't mean they're

233
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,780
completely wasted they are allowed to

234
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,879
reform and go through the process again

235
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:53,850
these amino acids are given up by the

236
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,980
tRNAs are used for the protein as a

237
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,509
result this tRNA it's released has to go

238
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,920
and find another amino acid and bind to

239
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:00,980
it and it's tried to process again

240
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,870
so beefing with this translation process

241
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:08,970
and basically this is how proteins are

242
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:12,330
made how this may look DNA transcription

243
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,250
to translation we saw this in the DNA of

244
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,920
replication so you can kind of see a

245
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,990
very similar pattern here except we're

246
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,750
only forming a single chain here we're

247
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,570
noticing the presence of yourself

248
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:27,029
indicating we're making RNA from our DNA

249
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,610
strand so we see our single strand kind

250
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:33,509
of forming here going right down and

251
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,490
right along our DNA here's our mRNA it's

252
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,990
the person in nucleus we're exiting out

253
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,470
the nucleus now we're in the cytoplasm

254
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:43,590
of the cell here's our two subunits

255
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,389
here's our tRNA here's our bonds being

256
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,950
formed our peptide bonds being formed

257
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:49,710
and we're looking putting together our

258
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:52,200
amino acids ultimately were forming a

259
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,450
protein we notice that all of these are

260
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,090
different amino acids they're all coding

261
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,280
and reading these three codon sequences

262
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,139
however at the very end scissors stop

263
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,029
codon you see I represent

264
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,370
associate this moves on to another

265
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,269
ribosome here's our peptide chain

266
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,399
hopefully for

267
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:11,208
into a functional protein remember

268
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,208
structure determines function

269
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:16,649
translation process summary again same

270
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:18,360
basic process as we saw there we have

271
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,490
our two subunits binding to the mRNA

272
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,649
TNA's are coming in linking a bunch of

273
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,959
amino acids together ultimately release

274
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,690
factor stop codon causes a new protein

275
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,159
to basically be formed another great

276
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,279
link here if you want to look from DNA

277
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:33,689
to protein a 3d model the process

278
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,269
continues until the stop codon enters

279
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:39,779
the a site and ribosome complex falls

280
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:41,909
apart in the protein is released another

281
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,919
way to show the translation process

282
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:46,708
keep in mind certain portions of it that

283
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,860
transcription portion occurs actually in

284
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:51,838
the nucleus but the ribosomes are

285
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,050
located in the cytoplasm are outside the

286
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:59,399
nucleus so this RNA sequence this mRNA

287
00:11:55,049 --> 00:12:01,319
must exit out to the nuclear pores and

288
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,000
if you want to hear different videos

289
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,649
from different presenters I put a couple

290
