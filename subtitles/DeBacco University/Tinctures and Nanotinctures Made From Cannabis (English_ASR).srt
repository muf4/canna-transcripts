1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,720
interested in learning about tinctures

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,798
in nanotinctures derived from cannabis

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:16,960
well this tobacco university video will

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:18,559
help answer just that

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,400
let's get into tinctures and nano

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,439
tinctures made from cannabis

7
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,198
so first off we're going to be

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,839
highlighting some products made by ct

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,599
pharma

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,920
why because they go through and publicly

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,759
make their analytical reports publicly

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
available in labels of the products they

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
produce

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,479
the descriptions and opinions and uses

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,920
in this video are intended to provide an

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,119
understanding of some end products of

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,879
the cannabis plant

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,320
and those important analytical reports

19
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,000
will be provided at the end

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,600
and they're often a missed component

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
that should accompany any product

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,359
someone is interested in purchasing so

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,000
first off let's start with the

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,719
description

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,878
of tinctures just in general tinctures

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,239
are a precisely formulated alcohol-based

27
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,159
marijuana extract

28
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,078
made from steeping cannabis material in

29
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,640
ethanol and it's a liquid that is

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,640
consumed orally for long lasting effects

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,679
nano tinctures are an alcohol-free

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,519
formulation

33
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,840
that can be added to a beverage with no

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,760
added taste they're designed to suspend

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,799
within a solution instead of adhering to

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,560
the container

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,920
so that's kind of that nano scale that

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
nano technology a lot of

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,519
new research being done that area it was

40
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,799
just really small particles so it's able

41
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,438
to stay in suspension

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,960
much easier what are some options when

43
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,079
we come to tinctures well

44
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,719
ct pharma offers tinctures that have thc

45
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,118
cbd and a one-to-one ratio of both

46
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,478
potency and dosage vary based on strains

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,438
it's important to make sure you're

48
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,159
matching up

49
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,559
whatever style of tincture that will

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,560
match

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,799
your intended needs now use of tinctures

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
well they can be consumed orally

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,200
lingually in the mouth or infused into a

54
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,720
drink for easy discrete consumption

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,560
they're popular among non-smoking

56
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,280
patients as there is no combustion or

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
inhalation

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,599
necessary so just another kind of option

59
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,639
here

60
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,640
that's derived from the cannabis plant

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
now examples of those certificates of

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,920
analysis as we can see here

63
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,079
we have the lot numbers we have the

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,679
testing for microbiology microtoxins

65
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,319
heavy metal and pesticides

66
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,800
as well as the terpenes and cannabinoids

67
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,598
that we

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,719
most often associate with and lastly

69
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,119
there is the label

70
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,318
as well so keep in mind that the labeled

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,319
example here

72
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,679
provides kind of a summary of all of

73
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:24,479
those numbers but it's your right as a

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,800
consumer

75
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,000
to be asking for those actual analytical

76
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,920
reports as well

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,919
now how do we get these numbers uh how

78
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,359
do we kind of go through this process

79
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,359
well kind of typically they are analyzed

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,080
on a high performance liquid

81
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,040
chromatography or hplc analyzing

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
this quantifies the cannabinoids is a in

83
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:49,759
gas chromatographs

84
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,879
hplc and gcms which is gas

85
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,399
mass spec and then the hplc is the high

86
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,598
performance liquid chromatography as

87
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,360
well for terpenes

88
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,799
so this shows you some of the equipment

89
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,959
that's used to generate

90
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,879
those testing samples it's always good

91
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,158
to get this done at a third party lab

92
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,919
and you confirm that

93
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,598
when you're looking at the actual

94
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,039
analysis here

95
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,799
so again just be that part of that

96
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,039
informed consumer have an idea

97
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,040
of where those numbers are coming from

98
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,598
and this is a great way to educate

99
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,158
yourself

100
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:21,280
and others about end products produced

101
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,280
from cannabis
