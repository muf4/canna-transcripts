1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,480
here we investigating some plant pest

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,460
control options

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,899
now when I say plant pest you may jump

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,000
to a conclusion and think maybe an

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,370
insect others may think of like a mouse

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,129
as being a pest these are all following

7
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:17,070
the same classification of plant pests

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,980
now if any plant pest diagnosis is

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,629
important knowing the exact pest to the

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,329
greatest degree of certainty is

11
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:26,129
advantageous because control depends on

12
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,379
the problem and which is why proper

13
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:31,919
diagnosis is important there can be a

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:33,329
small micro bass and that's gonna set

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,880
the steps into motion for what you're

16
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,980
going to carry out going forward so that

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,010
you're using the resources you have most

18
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:43,109
efficiently now is organic better we're

19
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,960
looking at plant pests those issues with

20
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:49,109
organic or Omri or USDA Organic those

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,780
are your typical touted as your organic

22
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,829
standards organic does not mean no spray

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,329
so don't want you to think that just

24
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,160
because something's organic doesn't mean

25
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,689
it wasn't sprayed with anything this

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,339
simply means that products can be

27
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,320
applied or from an approved list as

28
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,309
considered to have less harmful impacts

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,618
on the environment

30
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:06,569
however organic growers can still blue

31
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,280
even if they follow these organic rules

32
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:10,679
so it's just important to keep in mind

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,090
that knowing the grower knowing where

34
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,250
the food's coming from knowing where the

35
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,430
plant materials coming from is all is

36
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,810
very important just because it's organic

37
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,750
it doesn't mean again that there's no

38
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,969
spray it just means that the sprays are

39
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,228
from a more scrutinized list that's

40
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:26,478
thought to be more environmentally

41
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:28,709
friendly

42
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,478
now although sprays there's two

43
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,849
different types there's a systemic or

44
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,438
contact product classification the

45
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,349
systemic circulate within the plant

46
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:40,078
vascular system so you spray it in one

47
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:42,179
area we see three droplets here and it

48
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,339
spreads internally through the plant

49
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,430
this can allow for a more complete plant

50
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,740
protection and and can suppress disease

51
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,860
after it's initially infected the plant

52
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,030
that's in bandwith systemics however

53
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:55,560
because they enter through the plant

54
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,269
these are typically discouraged for

55
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,280
cannabis production because it can get

56
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,789
into the buds and leave internal

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,280
residues which when smoked or brought to

58
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,090
high temperatures can respond tiles so

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,250
that's why these are typically

60
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,700
discouraged the opposite that is called

61
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,650
contacts they must be applied actually

62
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,949
to the collagen agent so they must come

63
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,520
into

64
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:20,039
contact or the disease where the disease

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
will start these products only kill what

66
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,199
they touch so complete and even coverage

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,030
is important so if you're looking at

68
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,199
applying a contact product it's not

69
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,539
going to go systemically through the

70
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,969
plant so in this case three droplets if

71
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:35,519
it was a contact would only kill areas

72
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,739
in the three specific areas where it

73
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,599
touches the plant more even control is

74
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,370
definitely more advantageous for contact

75
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,709
the advantage it doesn't offer any

76
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,930
residuals in the plant the disadvantage

77
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,848
is it's on the applicator to ensure even

78
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,319
coverage

79
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:51,149
now how fungicides work fungicides are

80
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,488
grouped into their modes of action movie

81
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,140
demo a often is referred as frack codes

82
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,969
and stands for from the side resistance

83
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:58,708
action committee code what this

84
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,109
basically means is that depending on how

85
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,360
the fungicide may work is how it's

86
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,430
classified this is important for growers

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,170
to rotate modes of action to reduce the

88
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,140
chance of firmness becoming resistant to

89
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,548
applied fungicides if you wrote rotate

90
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,029
from the sides but they're the same mode

91
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,150
of action

92
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,829
you're really not rotating anything now

93
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,930
there's biological controls and this

94
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,969
consists of using pest natural enemies

95
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,680
to control the pest population so for

96
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,870
example with white fly which is a common

97
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,150
greenhouse pest so Tiny's wasp that's a

98
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,219
natural enemy eggs of the wasps we place

99
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,289
in the greenhouse populated with white

100
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,419
flies and they will seek out the Wi-Fi

101
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:35,578
larvae and attack so it's kind of a

102
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,629
great way to use one insect to help

103
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:41,730
control another because you're using a

104
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:43,500
insect it's this be a biology isn't a

105
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,530
living organism to control another

106
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,568
organism cultural control circle hasn't

107
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,250
many practices but choosing plants that

108
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:53,039
are resistant disease in insects is

109
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,229
important and they may have natural

110
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,269
defenses this is we're learning that

111
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:59,969
cultivar is very important for an area

112
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,219
knowing what might be more resilient to

113
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:04,650
certain diseases or common pressures is

114
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,269
also good information to document now

115
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,189
for physical controls we're looking at

116
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,889
adding a physical substance a physical

117
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:13,560
prevention method this could be perlite

118
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:17,250
this could be sand or rice hulls and the

119
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,810
surface to reduce gnats come we found on

120
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,120
that upper area of the soil where

121
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,589
there's a high moisture content putting

122
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,050
these substances at drain very easily

123
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:26,609
keep it dry now prevent that also

124
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,319
physical control the insect net and

125
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,180
creative

126
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,790
barrier between the insects and the

127
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,980
plants you're trying to protect chemical

128
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,660
controls utilize chemicals it sounds

129
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,759
pretty easy reduce to reduce pest

130
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,890
populations in this includes the

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,469
pesticides traps also sex hormones is

132
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,060
attractants in plant growth regulators

133
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,700
all fall near the chemical control

134
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,040
aspect as the size of the most dangerous

135
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:51,349
means of pest control in terms of risks

136
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,840
to humans in the environment so just

137
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,520
keep in mind that chemical control be

138
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,429
mindful of what particular chemical

139
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,899
because it can have varying risks to

140
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,990
know the applicator but also the

141
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:04,519
environment lastly screen cameras for

142
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,500
contaminants it's a number one reason

143
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:09,349
for product rejection is pesticide

144
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,850
residue limitations for testings because

145
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,700
you simply cannot test for chemicals

146
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,320
typically have to test for a particular

147
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,000
chemical that might be suspected to be

148
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,409
on the plant and why are may be

149
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,300
fungicides forbidden from cameras

150
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:23,030
production as I mentioned before this

151
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,980
camera is commonly smoked that can cause

152
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:28,069
chemicals to be changed into volatiles

153
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,900
and that could become aerosols which can

154
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:31,879
change the chemical profile potentially

155
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:33,889
make it more hazardous looking at this

156
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,420
the journal graph here looking at the

157
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,279
total number of targeted samples of

158
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,800
domestic important foods tested for

159
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,679
pesticide residue by the FDA you can see

160
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,329
that overall testing even food items has

161
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,759
gone down simply because of the sheer

162
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:49,490
volume that it takes in the difficulty

163
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,199
to test but for cannabis held a little

164
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,150
bit of a higher level simply because

165
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,920
it's not being consumed there's that

166
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:56,899
chance where those chemicals could be

167
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,780
turned into volatiles which could be

168
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:02,179
more harmful than their plane residues

169
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:04,069
if they were just consumed orally also

170
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,170
just again things to keep in mind when

171
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:07,610
looking at different options you want to

172
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,750
be looking at the bigger picture you

173
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,580
don't want to just spray something to

174
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,199
control pests one thing about the long

175
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:15,979
term implications to make sure your

176
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,170
product is gonna pass screening and held

177
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,590
to high standards so that there's not a

178
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:24,819
contamination of the product and your

179
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,819
potential recipients
