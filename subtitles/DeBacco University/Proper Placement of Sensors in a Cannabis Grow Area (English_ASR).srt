1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
this is an important aspect for all

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,040
indoor

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,200
cannabis growers and that is looking at

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,240
the proper placement of sensors

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,919
in the cannabis grow area so follow

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,919
along in this video and we'll go over

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,030
to make sure you're properly placing

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:24,079
your sensors for accurate readings

9
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:25,039
[Music]

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:26,959
all right let's make sure you're

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,240
properly placing your sensors in your

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,839
grow facility

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,159
so first off it's important to realize

14
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,119
that a sensor is only as good as its

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,238
placement

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,679
keep in mind what conditions you're

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:36,320
monitoring and how the placement of the

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,320
sensor will

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,878
impact those readings while there are

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,719
many conditions that should be monitored

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,878
temperature will be used as the example

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,039
provided here we want to make sure we're

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,679
right on point uh because we're off by a

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,960
little bit

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,719
that placement's off a little bit it's

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,399
really going to throw things off in the

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,079
facility in general

28
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,920
so where do you place your temperature

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,198
sensor what would be the kind of the

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,239
area that you place it in your grow

31
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,558
facility

32
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,919
well take a grow room or grow tent as an

33
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,000
example

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,519
near the top is often going to be higher

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,519
than average temperature

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,118
will be a given since heat is going to

37
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,158
naturally want to rise through your grow

38
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:11,840
facility

39
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,520
in the middle or at plant height gives a

40
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
general estimate of the area's

41
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,920
temperature

42
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,599
if you put it near the floor it'll be a

43
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,000
lower than average temperature given

44
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,599
that

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,599
colder air tends to sink as well as co2

46
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,039
so again that mindful of that area where

47
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,798
you're placing that sensor

48
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
so the obvious choices agro would say

49
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
would be i want to have my sensor at you

50
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,920
know plant height

51
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,758
while this is where most growers put the

52
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
monitor system this may not be

53
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,599
the best location reason being you want

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,118
to make sure you're taking other factors

55
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,798
into consideration

56
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,560
where is the light placement how's the

57
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,759
air circulation patterns in your grow

58
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,200
tent or grow room

59
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,040
are there doorway locations is that

60
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,519
impacting things are there viewing areas

61
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,359
are there

62
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,438
vents how is that going to impact

63
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,159
different factors when you're looking

64
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,959
specifically here at temperature as i

65
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,799
mentioned that light

66
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,399
placement so you want to ensure that

67
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,399
there's not a light directly on the

68
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,960
temperature sensor as this can cause an

69
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,239
inaccurate reading when i have some idea

70
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,078
where the plant is but want to be

71
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,959
mindful of where the intensity of the

72
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:08,399
light is

73
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,079
where that heat source from that light

74
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,560
is going and being projected we don't

75
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,719
want to

76
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
put that temperature sensor near that

77
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,080
because we're going to get a false

78
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,840
reading or a not accurate reading for

79
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,360
the grow area that the plant is being

80
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200
exposed to

81
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,120
those air circulation patterns that i

82
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,598
mentioned is the plant height getting

83
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
more

84
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,799
or is plant height getting less air

85
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,119
circulation from a fan

86
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,319
this will also impact the temperature so

87
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,159
you want to have an idea

88
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,318
of you know what is the general airflow

89
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,239
pattern in your grow facility is that

90
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,199
plant height really the best height

91
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,280
there

92
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,958
for temperature readings in that grow

93
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,800
facility

94
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,800
and doorway locations and doorway

95
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
locations could be physical doors

96
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
they could also be as we see here they

97
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,878
could also be

98
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,319
doorways as far as plant access points

99
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,159
so putting the sensor near the entrance

100
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,759
way is common practice to make

101
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,919
reading easier but you may want to

102
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,598
consider this is actually representative

103
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,280
of the field location

104
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,479
so in their growing location we want to

105
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
put near the doors and just kind of like

106
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,199
peek in and see what the temperature

107
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
is but again is that the best location

108
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,039
so what is the best location then well

109
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,360
the best location really comes down to

110
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,519
is an area that's representative of the

111
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
growing space so typically yes that's

112
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,039
around plant height

113
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,719
that should be the general kind of

114
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,158
consensus that's where the general

115
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,120
conditions are located

116
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:29,039
but look very hard at your system look

117
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,799
very hard at your environment

118
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,400
is that really representative what's

119
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,760
going on overall

120
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,439
you know we want to make sure we're away

121
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,158
from any fans and not too close to

122
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,120
lights

123
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,199
where are you going to place that

124
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
exactly because where you place that

125
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,839
sensor that's what your readings are

126
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,359
going to be based off of

127
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,000
so if you place the center in a poor

128
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,080
location if that's not in the right or

129
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,080
proper representative location in your

130
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,680
grow space that all the numbers you read

131
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
are going to be skewed in one direction

132
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,959
or another

133
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,920
causing you potentially to make false

134
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,479
data collection

135
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,238
and potentially not maximize the growing

136
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:04,158
facility a growing environment

137
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,158
and adjustments for your plants
