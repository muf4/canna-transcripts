00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
welcome to this debaco university

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,679
presentation here we're going to be

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,679
going

4
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,119
over some growing substrate options for

5
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,199
indoor cannabis production

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:16,160
with other videos going into more detail

7
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:19,118
on the options presented here

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,240
[Music]

9
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,759
all right let's look at some of the

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,679
substrate and some of the options

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,960
regarding canvas production

12
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,358
so first off when we're growing

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,118
typically indoors the

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,880
goal of substrates is to provide

15
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,719
physical support for the root structure

16
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,640
of the cannabis plant

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,640
in addition the acid can contain some

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,280
microbes it contains some fertilizer

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,799
but the main purpose of that substrate

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,840
or the properties of that substrate is

21
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,558
really to support

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,719
a healthy root structure the physical

23
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,919
morphology if you will of the actual

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,759
roots

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
so the properties of the substrate are

26
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,960
important those physical properties of

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,640
the substrate will impact how it

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,399
interacts with the nutrients so while

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,280
some substrates do contain some starter

30
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,640
nutrients

31
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,480
and that can be important growers can

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,160
add their own we really want to look at

33
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,519
some of the physical properties of some

34
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,719
of the substrates because we can

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,520
usually add or in some way modify the

36
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,039
nutrients

37
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,798
but the physical properties are what

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,439
we're looking at in this

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,640
general comparison so some common

40
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:15,599
substrate options

41
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,439
when we're looking at just the general

42
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,879
substrates there's soilless mix so you

43
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,239
can see here in the middle

44
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,158
coco coir and rockwool now soilless mix

45
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,599
is used a lot not only in cannabis but

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,280
other indoor

47
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,640
pop productions indoor container

48
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,478
productions cocoa does get a lot of

49
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,478
kind of interest in the sense that it

50
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,438
does allow for the roots to spread out

51
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,078
pretty well

52
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,118
it is generally considered to be inert

53
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,798
but we do want to be

54
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,239
mindful of the increased needing for

55
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,000
calmag and then

56
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,239
rockwell a lot of times used in the

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,478
early part for the clones as we see

58
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,438
here but can be used to grow full-size

59
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,078
plants

60
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,519
so these are the three most common

61
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,719
substrates that typically are found in

62
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,478
cannabis production

63
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,478
and you're welcome to search the channel

64
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,359
for more information on delving into the

65
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,679
details

66
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,680
of each of these three presented here
