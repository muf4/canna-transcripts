1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,400
this debaco university video is going to

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,240
look at the entourage effect

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,679
i think those that watch this video in

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,919
its entirety

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,800
may have may spark some interesting

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:17,509
conversation

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:20,640
in the comments below

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,240
[Music]

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,600
all right let's talk about the entourage

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,559
effects the reason we have this image

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,240
here as we

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,919
see a picture of two faces well it's

13
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,479
kind of like one image is made up a

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,080
bunch of

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,599
other smaller images that's kind of what

16
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,519
the entourage effect is

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,280
a bunch of small little things that come

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,680
together that create a

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,520
larger picture we're looking at this

20
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,960
from a scientific viewpoint

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,879
particularly with the entourage effect

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,079
this article does get cited quite a bit

23
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,039
this is a good one

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,480
to kind of take a look at and maybe kind

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,520
of research it here's the proper

26
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,439
citation

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
look at the article for yourself there

28
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,799
would be advised

29
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,120
so the android effect what's the concept

30
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,679
of the entourage effect just in general

31
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,959
the term entourage effect was coined by

32
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,640
israeli

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,359
israeli researcher dr raphael mukulum

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,000
to explain how a combination of cannabis

35
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,079
compounds

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
is more effective than an isolated

37
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,280
compound so it's the idea that

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,118
we have a bunch of these different

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,200
commons all coming together

40
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,200
the sum is greater than any individual

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,960
parts currently the term is used

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,719
to describe the way photocannabinoids

43
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,399
terpenes and other cannabis compounds

44
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,118
work together cooperatively

45
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,280
as opposed uh to one type of kinema

46
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,400
leading the charge while the rest follow

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,478
uh as the world entourage implies there

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,400
so not quite perfect use of the term but

49
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,840
the the idea that the sum of all these

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
parts is a greater effect than any

51
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,560
individual

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,239
so canvas and the entourage effect

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,519
canvas contains hundreds of molecules

54
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,118
that have the ability to interact with

55
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,359
our bodies and minds

56
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,599
general categories cannabinoids

57
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,840
flavonoids and terpenes just in general

58
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,519
all these canvas-derived molecules work

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,560
synergistically with one another

60
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,158
potentially enhancing the most desirable

61
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
effects that's why people are looking at

62
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,640
researching

63
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
determining what combination might be

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,799
the best or what

65
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,359
ratios might be the best for specific

66
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,159
effects

67
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,919
all related to this entourage effect so

68
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,439
cannabis and terpenes well kind of in

69
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,679
the image presented right uh

70
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,759
here terpenes may support or enhance the

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
therapeutic potency of cannabis such as

72
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,759
thc and cbd

73
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,759
this potential relationship between the

74
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,840
cannabinoids and compounds is known as

75
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,280
the entourage or the ins and symbol

76
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,200
effect terpenes

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,479
have the capacity to modulate the way

78
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,280
thc and cbd will bind to cb1 and cb2

79
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,359
receptors

80
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,280
in their own therapeutic effects which

81
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,160
are synergistic with the effects of

82
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,039
cannabinoids

83
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,639
so you have these kind of like

84
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,639
combinations of two creating that

85
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:46,079
entourage effect right here

86
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,439
so cbd and thc interactions well cbs

87
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,000
displayed an unusual ability to

88
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,680
antagonize cb1 at very low nano

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
molar levels that's basically very very

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,120
small concentrations

91
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,800
in the presence of thc despite having

92
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,959
little binding affinity

93
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,080
which is a fundamental example of the

94
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,759
entourage effect

95
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,519
this suggests that even in the presence

96
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,239
of small amounts of thc the binding

97
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,280
potential for

98
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,800
cbd becomes greatly increased so again

99
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,878
you have that kind of combination of the

100
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,879
two being greater than any single part

101
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,878
according to russo this supports cbd's

102
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,518
modality effect on thc

103
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,639
association adverse events such as

104
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,120
anxiety

105
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,399
uh tachycardia hunger sanitation and

106
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,080
rats in humans

107
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,000
however a definition a definite

108
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,040
correlation between cbd and the effect

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,680
of thc

110
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,878
has not been established so again we're

111
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,159
seeing this potential of this

112
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,518
interaction between these different

113
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,359
compounds

114
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,158
now what's the relationship between thc

115
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,519
and cbd well this is one example here

116
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,598
um we're looking at this kind of extract

117
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,039
the box moles probably mispronouncing

118
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,919
that

119
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,120
are cbd and thc extracts administered in

120
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,839
clinical settings as an

121
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,920
oral spry the cbd proved to be a

122
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,560
critical factor in the ability to treat

123
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,479
pain

124
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,840
in cancer patients who are unresponsive

125
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,119
to opioids

126
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,680
as a high thc extract devoid of cbd

127
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,438
failed to distinguish from placebo this

128
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,719
is a certain modular relationship

129
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,120
between thc

130
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,239
and cbd in most likely other cannabinoid

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,840
types and families

132
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,200
so what this means is basically they

133
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,479
needed to have both of these a

134
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,719
combination

135
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,560
to get the desired effects just applying

136
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,560
one or the other did not get that there

137
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
was that synergistic kind of combination

138
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,079
of the two

139
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
in this particular study that caused the

140
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,120
desired effects

141
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,639
so this is kind of what most people

142
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,918
associate and correlate with the

143
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,240
entourage effect

144
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,159
however we have to keep an open mind and

145
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
that there is this

146
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
scientific american article that's

147
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,079
published that basically states some of

148
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,240
its parts is marijuana's entourage

149
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,439
effect scientifically valid

150
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,120
so this is kind of an interesting

151
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,879
article you're welcome to take a look at

152
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
we'll explain it a little bit more here

153
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,079
it stated that industrial players swear

154
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,399
pots many chemicals work

155
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,639
in concert but most scientists here at

156
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,679
thc solo so this is potion

157
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,478
april 20th of 2017.

158
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,079
maybe a little weird as person 4 20 on

159
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,918
2017.

160
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,918
uh talk is cheap here so we're looking

161
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,599
at just in general uh the lay public has

162
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,560
really taken on the notion of the

163
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
entourage effect

164
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,199
but there's not a lot of data this is

165
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,759
mari a neurobiologist at columbia

166
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,280
university and cannabis researcher here

167
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,879
so i kind of give the example here of

168
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,319
like talk is cheap and just because you

169
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,000
hear it a bunch of times

170
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,560
is it actually true or is it actually

171
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,918
fact so counterpoint to the previous

172
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
article so that previous article that i

173
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,478
highlighted is

174
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,560
is right here welcome to take a look at

175
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,719
it but this is kind of a

176
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,319
counteraction to that previous article

177
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,039
the sense that the entourage effect

178
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,199
gained

179
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,800
some ground in 2011 and russo published

180
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,879
a paper in a british

181
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
journal of pharmacological review

182
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,918
pharmacology reviewing the potential

183
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,959
interactions

184
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,639
between thc in various cannabinoids and

185
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,599
terpenes and that was the first article

186
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,360
i highlighted

187
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,759
now we're looking at the counterpoint

188
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,800
which is the article here

189
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,240
published by a scientific american so

190
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,160
neurochemical actions

191
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
non-thc cannabinoids do have some

192
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,520
neurological actions

193
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,758
as they can affect often in different

194
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,318
ways cannabinoid receptors in the

195
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,560
central

196
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,840
nervous system most commonly cited

197
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,399
examples are cannabidiol

198
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,679
or cbd so we are seeing that cbd does

199
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,560
have some direct ways

200
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,319
that it alone can cause alterations with

201
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,399
neurotransmitters and receptors

202
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,960
and have an impact on the neurochemical

203
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,519
pathways of the body

204
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,239
ethan russo another researcher pictured

205
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,799
here

206
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,360
in about 40 percent of people about 10

207
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,879
milligrams of thc can potentially cause

208
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
toxic psychosis or thc induced psychotic

209
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,519
like

210
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,800
symptoms such as delusions so 10

211
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,359
milligrams about 40

212
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
of people will have that um reaction

213
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,000
sativex

214
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,600
a multiple sclerosis medication that is

215
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,639
not approved in the united states

216
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,160
has equal amounts of thc in cbd

217
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,598
and at amounts of 48 milligrams so 4.8

218
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,960
times greater than here

219
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:59,759
of thc in this in their study only four

220
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,478
patients out of 250 exposed about 1.6 of

221
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,360
people

222
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,800
had this toxic psychosis there so this

223
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,038
is a very important demonstration of

224
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,598
this

225
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,199
synergy thc alone is a poor drug and a

226
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,519
very poor therapeutic index

227
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,319
but in combination there can be some

228
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,159
potential

229
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:19,199
or greater benefits therapeutically with

230
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,800
reduction in potential for delusions so

231
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,160
i say you know show me the data what's

232
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,520
what's the data showing what are we kind

233
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
of looking at here

234
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,639
still there's no hard evidence that the

235
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
entourage effect is

236
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,918
actually real i know that statement will

237
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,598
come as a shock to a lot of people and

238
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,240
i'm sure i'm already getting comments uh

239
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,719
within

240
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,079
this video but double-blind clinical

241
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
trials are the gold standard for

242
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,639
research studies

243
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,319
in medicine and have never been

244
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,519
conducted to investigate the effects of

245
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,720
marijuana's terpenes

246
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,680
or its cannabinoids other than thc so

247
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,120
keep in mind we're talking about these

248
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,759
double-blind studies these clinical

249
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,439
trials

250
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
there's phase one phase two phase three

251
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,959
and phase four trials

252
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,080
uh we're looking at seeking fda approval

253
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,918
in this example

254
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,120
but basically we're having more people

255
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,758
tested for the

256
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,240
validity of any statement or any drug

257
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,360
that's being brought to market

258
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,800
so anecdotes are not data so holm says

259
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,319
that he does not like the fact that the

260
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,840
entourage affects supporters best

261
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,439
evidence lies in anecdotes

262
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,119
but he thinks they still tell an

263
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,719
important part of the story

264
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,519
because studies have not been carried

265
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,199
out but you have thousands and thousands

266
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,478
of people reporting the same thing it

267
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
gets hard to ignore

268
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,318
i'm not saying that it's not necessarily

269
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,199
not true for those that made it this far

270
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,960
in the video

271
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,960
but we're basing really attractive

272
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,158
effects mostly in this care the ink

273
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:34,559
the anecdotes than the actual clinical

274
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,718
trials studies are difficult because

275
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,879
currently being a schedule one

276
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,039
status of the drug putting research

277
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,799
licenses out of reach of many scientists

278
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,360
making it hard to conduct those clinical

279
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,958
trials at the current time

280
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,639
so what about edibles too another

281
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,838
important consideration edibles lack

282
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,360
terpenes since they're

283
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,040
volatile compounds and edibles need to

284
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,278
go through a heating process

285
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,439
they also reported to have effects with

286
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,639
basically no terpenes so how are they

287
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,880
going about

288
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,958
showing positive medical potential

289
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,360
effects for patients

290
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,239
uh it could be true but i always give a

291
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,320
question there

292
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
he says that marijuana may actually have

293
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,120
the entourage effect but it's still

294
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,000
impossible to know without more

295
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,080
information

296
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,600
such as strain comparisons so i'm not

297
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,680
saying it's not true

298
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,278
we're just saying that right now don't

299
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,039
really have great scientific

300
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,559
evidence we're kind of on the weak side

301
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,079
opinions anecdotes

302
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,000
maybe some initial lab studies can be

303
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,879
conducted is there some studies in some

304
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,639
humans

305
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,399
randomized controlled trials ultimate

306
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,039
gain to the metal analysis or systemic

307
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,879
review

308
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,480
this is very strong evidence this is

309
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,480
very weak evidence and sadly the

310
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,519
entourage effect falls closer

311
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,440
to that weaker than the stronger side so

312
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,039
we also have to consider the placebo

313
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,160
effect this is kind of our last little

314
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,799
statement

315
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,399
here the placebo effect is very powerful

316
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,719
if you believe smoking a bud will give

317
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,440
you

318
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,920
a bright cerebral experience spilling

319
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
with

320
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,159
creativity or that a thc pill will make

321
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,559
you anxious and paranoid

322
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,439
then that is what you are probably going

323
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,518
to feel

324
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
we have the example here of one person

325
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,480
dating a drug one person take a placebo

326
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,078
that's no drug and basically getting the

327
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,039
same result because they feel they're

328
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,639
taking the right

329
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,559
the drug so they're getting the

330
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,159
anticipated effects there

331
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,000
so again we get a little bit of

332
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,919
complication added here

333
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,120
so with our entourage effect not saying

334
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,199
it's not real

335
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,720
we just need to realize that right now

336
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,720
there's not some great scientific

337
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,839
studies really in support of it

338
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,160
not saying those won't come in the

339
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,240
future and that's great about science

340
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,000
and hopefully the future of research

341
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,839
but right now we don't have any great

342
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,639
scientific studies but hopefully that

343
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,680
