1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,799
this debaco University video is for

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,500
those Growers considering flipping the

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,720
switch and converting from HPS or high

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,279
pressure sodium lights to LED lights

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,660
going to walk you through some of the

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,058
changes you're going to have to consider

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,160
but you might want to know ahead of time

8
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,079
before simply just changing out the

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:26,339
fixtures

10
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:29,339
[Music]

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,859
all right so the information for this

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,679
presentation is based off the gavita

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,719
guide provided there is a downloadable

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,179
paper and there's also they did a

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,399
webinar author and did a webinar on

16
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,039
YouTube with the link provided here the

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,179
transcript some information but to just

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,378
go over some of those ideas or tips when

19
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,840
you're looking at making this transition

20
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,299
from an HPS lighting to an LED lighting

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,760
setup so things we want to keep in mind

22
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,339
so this is this form of a lighting

23
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,780
manufacturer that sells both HBS and LED

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,960
lights since they're looking at

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,519
competing cavitas structures here but it

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,019
is providing information to help Growers

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,118
make the switch they want you to be

28
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,459
successful if you are going to be making

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,500
that change this is based off the papers

30
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:16,438
and the webinar based on the same

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,200
company if it has been known to be a top

32
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,839
producer of HPS lights so seeing them

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,820
make the transition

34
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,439
Tip Sheet is an indication that the

35
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,079
advanced assessment of their LED light

36
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,639
technology is here to there where there

37
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,140
could be as you're saying here a

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,780
potential for a one-to-one replacement

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,978
we have to look beyond the fixtures

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,420
so first off what we're going to be

41
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,359
comparing going to be looking at well

42
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,280
this is the gavita SL2 it's a thousand

43
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,140
watt double ended bulb it's considered

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,640
to be the kind of industry standard if

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,000
you will through Slimline it's kind of

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,920
their most advanced HPS light that's

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,700
going to be compared to their new

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,320
agavita CT 1930e which is their LED

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,240
um light you can read all the details

50
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,158
there and as always a link in the

51
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:00,599
description for all the sources are

52
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,399
provided as well

53
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,379
now this is just the general comparison

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,019
if you're looking at uh purchasing both

55
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,758
of these I just went to a website here

56
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:11,878
and just pulled them both up make sure

57
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,878
they were both of the um same voltage to

58
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:17,120
208 to 240 volt you could see that the

59
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:22,459
HPS light comes in at

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,459
237.17 and the LED light at

61
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,719
1516.95 which are both at the same time

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,879
pulled down so just for a source of

63
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,439
comparison so we'll do that quick grower

64
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,780
comparison you know more than just the

65
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,359
cost comparison flower coverage area the

66
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,219
HPS light does a 4x4 the LED light does

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,459
a little bit more area four by six is

68
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:43,259
stated 1000 watts compared to 780 Watts

69
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,939
as a result the estimated cost of

70
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:48,419
electricity per month to run the HPS

71
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,219
would be 43.20 compared to the LED light

72
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,259
at

73
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:56,098
33.70 the warranty is three years on the

74
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:58,079
HPS in five years on the LED just to do

75
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:01,018
some quick math One LED light is the

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,379
same cost as 6.3 HPS light

77
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,300
so you could buy 6.3 of these or just a

78
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:08,098
little over six of these to one of these

79
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,319
lights and the L but the LED light does

80
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:11,818
have a 20 Energy savings so take that

81
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,259
into consideration

82
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,759
now five tips for the seamless

83
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,799
transition they mentioned adjusting

84
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,378
temperature when growing with LEDs the

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,840
VPD or vapor pressure deficit as a

86
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,759
management tool factor in your HVAC as

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,378
well as your dehumidification consider

88
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,000
the effects of the letting spectrum and

89
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:28,859
the light intensity on your show some

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,780
crop to grow and monitor in just

91
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,819
nutrition and irrigation based on

92
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,620
transpiration and I'll cover all these

93
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:36,780
in detail in this video

94
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,959
so first off the change in temperature

95
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,080
when growing with LED lights HPS lights

96
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,539
produce heat in high amounts as anyone

97
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,459
who has used those uh will know it's

98
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,979
considered to be a waste or its radiant

99
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,539
heat but it does help heat the leaf

100
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,340
surface that's important to keep in mind

101
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,259
it does stimulate natural foliage

102
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,939
heating which would occur outside in the

103
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,739
sun or what mimics that type of

104
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,959
environment that plants are accustomed

105
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,180
to this drives the transpiration of the

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,098
plant which is the plant's movement of

107
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,900
water or nutrients through the plants

108
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:09,060
that's important to consider LED lights

109
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,860
are still giving off some heat keep that

110
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,360
in mind it's that no heat but high

111
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,939
pressure sodiums definitely have a lot

112
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,739
to heat that leaf surface

113
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:18,540
now at least temperature comparison so

114
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,099
they did some data and this is pulled

115
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,479
from the webinar there that they did

116
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,360
great webinar to check out if you're

117
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,039
interested this graph does quantifies

118
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,139
the difference in temperature of the

119
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,060
leaf surface under LED lights as we can

120
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,000
see down here compared to high pressure

121
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,819
sodium lights note the same cultivar a

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,040
Blackberry punch was used and the plant

123
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:40,439
lighting height was also maintained at

124
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,720
the same also Ambient Air Temperature as

125
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,300
I tried to highlight down here was also

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,699
regulated to be the same in both rooms

127
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,340
HBS does produce more infrared which is

128
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,560
that 700 to 850 nanometers which results

129
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:54,599
in the heating of the leaf surface there

130
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,399
so you can see kind of the average

131
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,020
um here compared to the average here

132
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,779
when they had an ambient temperature of

133
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:02,219
26.5 degrees Celsius and again it's

134
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,918
rough figuring out here looking a little

135
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,840
over 24 degrees Celsius in here kind of

136
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,240
the rough middle maybe just a little bit

137
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,619
uh below 28 degrees Celsius for the leaf

138
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,259
temperature

139
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,840
now LED lights they can shift the room

140
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,520
temperature so Growers should get an

141
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,560
infrared temperature sensor as we can

142
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,180
see right here to know what their

143
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,220
current Leaf temperatures are it's a

144
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,300
great way to do a little spot check and

145
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,620
it allows you to get really quick

146
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,600
readings

147
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,399
you want to take random samples so the

148
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,039
plants are growing and record those

149
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,959
results this data for the grower can be

150
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,418
used to adjust the ambient temperature

151
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,339
of the growing environment after they go

152
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:40,439
through and install LED lights to match

153
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,060
the previous plant conditions so if

154
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,560
you're growing that are high intensity

155
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,660
discharge it's a high pressure sodium

156
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,339
lights take some readings as the plants

157
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,660
are actively growing document those

158
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,698
readings because you might be needing to

159
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,100
adjust your growing room conditions to

160
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:56,720
match those this also this temperature

161
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,800
does impact the VPD or vapor pressure

162
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,199
deficit that Growers want to be

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,180
considering considering to help manage

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,340
their growing rooms so again it's an

165
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,740
important consideration it's often not

166
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,359
discussed or talked about the changing

167
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,100
of the room temperature that might need

168
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,979
to be needed when making the switch to

169
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,539
LED lights so how do we use VPD well I

170
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:17,399
have a video on that not to be

171
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:20,038
self-promoting but it goes out into more

172
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,538
detail but the basics is that air can

173
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:23,818
only hold a certain amount of water

174
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:25,560
vapor at a given temperature before it

175
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,800
starts to condense back into a liquid

176
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,660
would form forms such as do or rain if

177
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,879
we're used to being seen outside in the

178
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,500
morning as the air gets hotter the

179
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,120
amount of water that the air can hold

180
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,279
does increase but as the air cools down

181
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,780
the air cannot hold as much water vapor

182
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,698
and that's kind of what REITs is kind of

183
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,559
this graph here that's why there's dual

184
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,419
over everything and after a cool morning

185
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,879
the air just is too full of water and

186
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:51,978
the water condenses out of that air this

187
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,240
is kind of just a quick little

188
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:56,159
comparison here of temperature and

189
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,900
relative humidity and kind of the green

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,060
zone here would be kind of where you

191
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,138
want to keep your plants in so if you're

192
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,478
looking at the change in temperature

193
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,960
against in Fahrenheit from 50 degrees to

194
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,519
113 tells you the relative humidity you

195
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,799
need to be at as well and kind of gives

196
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,299
you an idea of the ranges here of where

197
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,699
to keep your plants ideally happy and

198
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,300
transpiring at an adequate rate

199
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,340
so a general summary of vapor pressure

200
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,020
deficit and key points is that it's

201
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,219
mostly about transpiration which is the

202
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,439
movement of that water through the

203
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,259
plants plants transpire significantly

204
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,598
less at night so keep that in mind use a

205
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,919
night period for preventing Disease by

206
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,560
keeping committee and Air temps

207
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:37,379
typically lower try to minimize VPD

208
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,918
fluctuations for the measurement that's

209
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:42,779
used less than 0.4 kilopascals VPD still

210
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,719
matters for respiration at night so keep

211
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:48,119
that in mind daytime VPD is about 10

212
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,680
times more important than nighttime VPD

213
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,800
so if you're going to focus on one area

214
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,038
focus on the daytime often the dpd can

215
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,379
increase yields as much as as much as

216
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:59,699
CO2 enrichment can so we don't want to

217
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,319
be restricting our plants in any way

218
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,419
this is just another way to help

219
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,220
maximizing that relative humidity and

220
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:07,680
temperature to maximize our growing

221
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,180
space and again summary although VPD at

222
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,340
night is not nearly as important as your

223
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,199
daytime it's still an important factor

224
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,000
to consider for vigorous plant growth

225
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,919
and increased yields and so something

226
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,598
that could be holding you back even in

227
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,219
your current setup

228
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,098
so we talk about adjusting things

229
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,259
adjusting the HVAC and consider and

230
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:27,659
consider dehumidification when using LED

231
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,300
lights so again as a reminder LED lights

232
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,300
still produce heat LEDs just produce

233
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,219
more light per watt than an HPS setup so

234
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,098
you get the same amount of light but it

235
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,599
takes less heat to produce that often

236
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,300
this reduction in heat from the lights

237
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,219
but this will increase but with an

238
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,159
increase in room temperature there can

239
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,019
be less Demand on the HVAC system this

240
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,539
can result in a compensation with a

241
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,940
dehumidifier so the light fixtures may

242
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:56,219
be a one-to-one change from led to HPS

243
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,440
but there may be more supplemental

244
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,740
equipment such as a dehumidifier that is

245
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,480
needed to help maintain equal growing

246
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,919
conditions so this is important

247
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,740
consideration that just because you're

248
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,958
switching out one light for another you

249
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,019
may also need to bring in another piece

250
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,819
of equipment to help maintain that room

251
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,278
environment from a plant standpoint

252
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,560
related to VPD

253
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,139
now we're looking at our lights as heat

254
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,759
sinks are really critical the goal is to

255
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,740
pull heat away from the actual LED

256
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,778
lights to reduce the degradation of the

257
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,580
diodes the heat sinks on the back of the

258
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:31,139
fixture further help this processor kind

259
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,080
of removing those that heat that way

260
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:36,679
rail design LEDs have less of an issue

261
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,600
compared to this compact form of LED

262
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:42,479
style that allows for easier transition

263
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,040
from HBS style of lighting keep in mind

264
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,300
if you're looking at other lights you

265
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,240
want to avoid ones that have fans

266
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:51,120
because tens the fans tend to fail more

267
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,100
than the LED light structures and you

268
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,320
can get to overheating that way this is

269
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,480
a passive heat sink technology which is

270
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,240
really great at prolonging the life of

271
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,100
the LED lighting fixture

272
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,220
so how we're looking at impacts of light

273
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,860
Spectra and intensity so the bpfd or

274
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,839
photosynthetic Photon flux density is

275
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,180
measured in micro moles per square meter

276
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,339
per second this is the long unit which

277
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:16,139
establishes exactly how many power

278
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,540
photons and that's in the photosynthetic

279
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:21,059
Spectrum are landing in a specific area

280
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:23,639
you want to measure the this is a

281
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:25,379
measure of light intensity taken at

282
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,819
canopy level as the plants were growing

283
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,338
as we can see here time and days after

284
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,560
transplant and LED lights are providing

285
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:35,220
a more intense light at the canopy level

286
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:38,219
this result can result in an increase in

287
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,920
potential yield so we're looking at our

288
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,278
comparison with LED lights and the kind

289
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:46,379
of the circles up here and then the HPS

290
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,059
sights in the red circles down here we

291
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,100
can see that there's a consistent

292
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,199
separation with a little bit more light

293
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,019
intensity produced with the LED lights

294
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,940
compared to the HPS lights

295
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,740
now we're looking at the room layout

296
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,300
essentially a one-to-one conversion of

297
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,799
the fixtures in the physical space of

298
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,139
the grow room so we do a quick

299
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,179
comparison of HPS and LED light and they

300
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,519
didn't average bpfd and uniformity

301
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:10,559
compared to the two rooms note that the

302
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,720
average ppfd and uniform are nearly the

303
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,479
same when you compare the two with a

304
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,879
slight Edge to ppfd for LED lights as

305
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,920
well as uniformity but it is only slight

306
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,659
in contrast to the previous Graphics

307
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,759
this is likely due to the Natural

308
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:26,159
degradation of the HPS bulbs if you've

309
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,620
got brand new HPS bulbs compared to LEDs

310
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,240
you might see a more similar if we're

311
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,560
looking at the one just going back for a

312
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,240
second here looking at some of these

313
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:35,278
these HP sights could be a little bit

314
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,159
older and so you could be seeing more of

315
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,019
a reduction in the light intensity there

316
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,360
compared to the information that was

317
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,620
gathered here presented comparing these

318
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,419
two rooms

319
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,339
now light distribution

320
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,319
so similar light distribution of LED and

321
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,140
HPS lights this helps them to be a

322
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,000
one-to-one um kind of transition and you

323
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,159
can see the HPS lights and the LED

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,600
lights you know very similar light

325
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,480
spread pattern compared to just a raw

326
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,360
LED diode that's spreading of that light

327
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,519
allows for a more even distribution into

328
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,079
the plant canopy kind of how does this

329
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,600
look from a plant standpoint well this

330
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,519
is a nice kind of ppfd map we're looking

331
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,100
at our HPS lights and our LED lights

332
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,259
that widespread Optics of the LED with

333
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,180
proper design layout allow for an even

334
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,278
distribution of the light we could see

335
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:22,799
that right here in the lower LED ones

336
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,838
this offers a cross room look kind of

337
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,699
looking kind of sideways to give you

338
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,560
that idea where that spread is we can

339
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,540
see that there is a slight benefit there

340
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,119
to the LED lights creating that more of

341
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,699
that even spread across the plant canopy

342
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,778
so another Advantage there to the LED

343
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,300
lights

344
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:41,399
now late Spectrum comparisons LEDs do

345
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,859
have more blue than hps's we can see

346
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,899
this here this peak here is for the

347
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,120
um LED light and we can see the HPS

348
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:51,059
light here and the darker black shading

349
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,480
blue light can induce stomatic opening

350
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,919
which can increase the evapotrate

351
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,600
evapotranspiration and the humidity in

352
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,059
the grow room this is part of the reason

353
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,278
why that dehumidifier might be a needed

354
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:04,500
component to your growing environment

355
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:05,759
differences may be slight in reduced

356
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,278
internode spacing with blue light

357
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,480
spectrum it is cultivar dependent and it

358
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,419
can also potentially increase

359
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,220
cannabinoid levels as well but not

360
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:15,599
necessarily to a great degree because

361
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,160
you're getting a mixed spectrum is that

362
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,259
just a blue light but there's some

363
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,240
research that does indicate that

364
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:24,360
now light intensity we're looking at our

365
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,180
light intensity since LEDs do emit less

366
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,159
radiant heat than HPS cultivators can

367
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,379
increase the ppfd or the amount of plant

368
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,778
usable light measured in photons to

369
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:36,360
higher levels than recommended when

370
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:38,159
using HPS this can be a specially

371
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,680
advantageous when carbon dioxide

372
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,240
supplementation is being utilized in a

373
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,099
grow room and we can see that right here

374
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,919
where you're looking at running at 400

375
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,600
which is ambient air to 800 to 1400 how

376
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,519
much more light intensity the plants can

377
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,800
handle and there's some recommendations

378
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,560
there and again investing in a parameter

379
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,838
would be advised there so you exactly

380
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,338
know how much intensity of light your

381
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,260
plants are getting

382
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,240
so data different changes to nutrient

383
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:05,759
and irrigation based on this uh

384
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,320
transpiration so you want to know what

385
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,439
the Baseline is for your current system

386
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,899
as is what you'll be adjusting to

387
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,360
basically match it's a common

388
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,399
misconception that switching from HPS to

389
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,959
LED lights automatically trigger a need

390
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,539
for increased nutrient and irrigation

391
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,479
levels under ideal conditions higher

392
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,219
ppfds levels do generally lead to faster

393
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,019
growth and lead to an increased need for

394
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,759
nutrients in water but it's best to know

395
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,560
what you're currently using to use that

396
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,600
as a base of comparison this is where

397
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,939
your grow journals are very important

398
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,159
however nutrient needs increase because

399
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,040
Growers do not adjust the other room

400
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:43,078
parameters like ambient temperature VPD

401
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,419
and dehumidification not strictly

402
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:48,719
because of higher ppfd levels so there's

403
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:50,759
other factors that can drive that need

404
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,680
for plants nutrients in water

405
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,620
consumption to be changed

406
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:58,259
now this uh Kavita did produce this kind

407
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,940
of um LED cultivation set points you

408
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:01,799
guys this is their recommendations I

409
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,839
figured I'd include that here we're

410
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,819
looking at mother plants compared to

411
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,980
propagation vegetative flower and a

412
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,379
flush week with the photo period with

413
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,120
the light intensity the CO2 day and

414
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:14,039
night the day and nighttime temperature

415
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,440
as well as relative humidity and

416
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,179
leaching fractions so a good Baseline to

417
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,100
see what your own data is and just

418
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:22,138
compare it to here again they offered it

419
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,540
so I posted it here for you

420
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:26,220
now is there a true cost savings well

421
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:27,778
this can be harder to determine as

422
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,060
there's often rebates which are great

423
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:31,620
but often vary across the region and are

424
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,179
not always the same so that kind of

425
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,339
offers a little bit of a degree of

426
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,899
variability if you will fix your upfront

427
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,120
costs and changes to the HVAC system

428
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,860
need to be taken into consideration in

429
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,620
addition to the energy consumption to

430
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,199
run the lights so here's our HPS here's

431
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,820
our LED and a proper LED system you can

432
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,979
see there's some additional equipment

433
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,199
that's added to keep that growing room

434
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,000
happy so again that's something that

435
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:55,620
needs the Growers need to be advised

436
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
that switching up the lights is great

437
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,480
but there may be other environmental

438
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,220
changes that they may not have those

439
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,320
types of equipment if they're currently

440
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,879
running HPS lights okay so here's what

441
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,920
you've all been waiting for my grower

442
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,179
suggestions of looking at all this data

443
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,120
here's what I can offer to you as

444
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,859
Growers going to LED light lighting

445
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,560
needs to be a complete room commitment

446
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,539
by the grower changing out failed HPS

447
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,638
lights to LED despite there being a

448
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:22,919
one-on-one coverage area comparison is

449
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,399
not advised due to the different plant

450
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:28,319
environmental impacts currently HPS is

451
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,720
overall a little more cost effective

452
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,120
option since you get more than six HPS

453
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,278
lights for the cost of a single LED

454
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,740
light fixture but this cost difference

455
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,240
can buy a lot of electricity in bulbs so

456
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,879
right now I'm not sure if it's worth

457
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,579
that one-to-one comparison as you saw

458
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,198
earlier that big dollar amount for the

459
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:48,419
fixtures in addition to potential room

460
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,179
changes the difference may not be

461
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:53,338
justifiable at least right now

462
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:55,138
so lighting going forward so LED

463
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:57,660
technology is a technology of the future

464
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:00,299
and is currently available but is cost

465
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,919
prohibitive for many as with any

466
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,318
technology there will be improvements

467
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,459
and also reduce costs going forward for

468
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,199
example an improvement that could be

469
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,419
made could be those customizable plant

470
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,459
spectrums and hopefully the research to

471
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:14,579
back it up as far as maximizing plant

472
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,558
productivity once the cost of initial

473
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:18,959
purchase drops it'll make it an easier

474
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,578
switch for Growers to make as you have

475
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,860
seen it's more than just simply changing

476
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:24,058
out the fixtures which hopefully a lot

477
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,979
of Growers are hoping to be that easy

478
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:28,678
but there is other factors to consider

479
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,720
so it may be worth the wait a little bit

480
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,759
longer if you currently have an HPS

481
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,019
setup it's working well for you might be

482
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,400
able to hold on to that setup for a

483
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,619
little bit longer be aware of the

484
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,298
technology and if you are making the

485
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:40,979
change over to LED lights hopefully this

486
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:43,440
video as well as other research you do

487
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,058
allows you make an informed decision so

488
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,980
you can take one successful operation

489
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:49,440
and go right into another successful

490
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,679
operation knowing what you're getting

491
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,679
into
