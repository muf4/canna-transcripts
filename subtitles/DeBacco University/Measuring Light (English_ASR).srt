1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,140
he went about measuring light and some

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,359
of the units that you may see stated and

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,489
what does kind of mean there's just one

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,039
example here I can help our meter to

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,900
measure light also I included a link to

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,899
the fundamentals of a light kind of

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,359
Summit lecture I located on youtube if

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,310
you want to take a look at that also so

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,650
first off you may hear the term lumens

10
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,118
used the lumens a measure of the total

11
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:26,608
quality visible light emitted by a

12
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,640
source however this has greater ties to

13
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,500
the human visible spectrum so kind of a

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,480
cliche term mirrors lumens are for

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,030
humans so something that may look bright

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:39,179
to our eye may not necessarily be bright

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,329
or produce something that is also

18
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,640
beneficial to plants in the same way so

19
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,170
par or photosynthetic active radiation

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,079
this is a measure of the amount of light

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,539
in the 400 to 700 nanometers which is

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,520
where a plant needs to grow there's four

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,399
hundred seven or Navis kind of that full

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,230
visible light spectrum the higher the

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,329
power rating the more efficient the

26
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:02,608
plant will be since it measures the type

27
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,920
of light needed for this photosynthetic

28
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,629
process that's important to keep in mind

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,890
this par is a better measurement than

30
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:13,259
lumens now PFF or photosynthetic photon

31
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,820
flux is how many photons are being

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,978
released from a light source every

33
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,618
second the eight typically uses micro

34
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:21,450
moles per second color this is limiting

35
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:22,680
it doesn't tell you how much of the

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,290
measure light actually lands in the

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,580
plants but it's important metric if you

38
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,520
want to calculate the efficiency of

39
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,658
lighting system is that creating par so

40
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,670
that the example here we can see how

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,859
this light is scattered now I'm a plant

42
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,840
under this light a lot of this scattered

43
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,209
light will be part of the PF at the

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,400
photosynthetic photon flux being

45
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,349
released the photons released from this

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,118
light what's that going to be taken up

47
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:46,640
by the plant here a lot of this for

48
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,879
example will be wasted

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,519
there's ppfd photosynthetic photon flux

50
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,048
density and this is how many photons are

51
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,310
hitting your plant so this is a very

52
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,350
important measure and the one you should

53
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,478
look for if you're looking at comparing

54
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,908
lights or trying to get information from

55
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,200
a manufacturer this is a spot

56
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,380
measurement so it's important to take an

57
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,229
average of several PFDs measurements the

58
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,719
defined height that are taken micro

59
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,319
moles per meter squared per second is

60
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,389
the often

61
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,188
limitations this can overstate the true

62
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:20,378
light intensities of the fixture you

63
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:22,870
want to see published average ptsds

64
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:24,548
over a growing area one does a spot

65
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,438
measurement when I see it over an area

66
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:27,879
because I'll tell you again the photon

67
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,370
flux density the amount of light

68
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,229
actually hitting your plant so it

69
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,349
actually can be absorbed and used by the

70
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:36,848
leaves for photosynthesis measuring

71
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:38,318
light with par meters sensors are

72
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:40,719
primary instruments used to qualify

73
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,128
these light intensities well if you're

74
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,769
going to test your light allow it to

75
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:46,509
warm up for at least 5 minutes or so

76
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,129
before doing any intensity of the light

77
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:50,620
readings signature you're getting an

78
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:52,780
accurate reading these sensors work by

79
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,789
an optical filter to create your uniform

80
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,549
sensitivity for car light the light

81
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:59,370
meter measures instantaneous light

82
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,349
intensities or data loggers to measure a

83
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,908
cumulative light intensity also be

84
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,568
careful what like meteor you may be

85
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:07,060
using

86
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:09,608
make sure it's best match for your light

87
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,569
source that you're using some have

88
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:15,969
choices between artificial sources some

89
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:19,659
of the ways to measure the Sun on some

90
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:21,159
are best for or limited for LED lights

91
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,620
some are better for high pressure sodium

92
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,389
so again just be mindful of which one

93
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,400
that you're using and realize its

94
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:29,400
limitations and what it's best for
