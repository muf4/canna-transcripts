1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,160
okay here we're gonna go over different

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,240
types of RNA up to this point you might

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,210
have thought there's only one type of

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,820
RNA when in fact there's actually four

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,289
main different types of RNA we have them

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,250
labeled here mRNA tRNA our RNA and RNA I

7
00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:18,960
we're going to go through each of these

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,600
in detail and try to give an explanation

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,900
and how they relate to seller and

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,250
biological processes so starting with

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,339
the main components for protein

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,320
production now there's three key

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,530
components that we have RNA that are

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,988
required to make proteins mRNA and that

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,270
stands for messenger RNA you see it

16
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:43,169
labeled here and it's single-stranded

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:47,820
it's producing a message or a single

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,640
strand of nucleic acids tRNAs transfer

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,049
RNA we see that located over here so

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,969
transfer RNA is transferring or reading

21
00:00:55,049 --> 00:01:00,089
certain regions on the mRNA and

22
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,670
transferring an amino acid so it's

23
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,040
responsible for grab my new acid bring

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,430
it to the mRNA sequence and transferring

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,520
that from some point in the cell to

26
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,650
developing a polypeptide sequence our

27
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,408
RNAs ribosomal RNA that's the one

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,500
pictured over here so this ribosomal RNA

29
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,200
down here is what is involved with

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,400
protein production so what we have a

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,350
large and a small subunit and over here

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,810
the mRNA is basically going and being

33
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:36,359
read right across and going to the RNA

34
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,909
so here in the our RNA we're noticing

35
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:43,379
that the mRNA is being protected

36
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,270
now the trna located right here is

37
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,000
what's coming into the ribosome and

38
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,469
that's it's transferring the amino acids

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,629
just as a reminder we're talking all

40
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,658
about RNA here and that's ribonucleic

41
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:56,810
acid deoxyribonucleic acids DNA Nance

42
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,310
without that oxygen on that backbone

43
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:04,079
sugar chain so just keep those in mind

44
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,629
these are all RNA okay so looking at

45
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,449
mRNA in more detail remember mRNAs and

46
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:11,878
from messenger RNA it's a short section

47
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,500
of genetic material encoded from a DNA

48
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:14,909
molecule so

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,830
organized into three base pairs called

50
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:21,810
codons so we can see up here or saying

51
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,730
that there's the three base pairs those

52
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,800
are the codons and we could see them

53
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,590
kind of each little individual unit here

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,219
working its way down all the way to the

55
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,020
end here

56
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:34,590
each of these three base pairs is a

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,010
codon now up here we're noticing at the

58
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,349
very end it says a stop codon so this

59
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,899
stop codon is important because each

60
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:45,840
codon encodes for specific amino acid

61
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,599
sequence only the stop codon does not

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,280
encode for an amino acid sequence it

63
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,469
actually terminates protein synthesis

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,500
it's a way of saying stop or end so to

65
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:59,280
speak and it is still a three base pair

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:03,539
it's so look at all of these a's G's C's

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,459
and use are the same nucleotides that we

68
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:07,859
learned with DNA keeping in mind that

69
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,530
because we see you your so we were

70
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,650
definitely looking at a DNA molecule to

71
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,150
continue on with messenger RNA there's

72
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,969
actually two different subtypes of

73
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:22,469
messenger RNA so we have what we call

74
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:25,349
pre mRNA going to mature mRNA now don't

75
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:29,280
confuse mature RNA as this M being

76
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:31,409
mature this mRNA is here in here still

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,049
stands for messenger RNA so there's pre

78
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:36,329
messenger RNA to mature messenger RNA

79
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,939
pre RNA contains in trying to turn

80
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,570
non-coding sequences and we see those up

81
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:44,099
here there are regions of the pre

82
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,799
earning that don't encode for anything

83
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,719
these introns are spliced out or removed

84
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,079
resulting in a continuous strain of

85
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,120
exons which is what the mature mRNA is

86
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,620
composed of so why would there be

87
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,959
non-coding agents why does this make

88
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,420
sense well in the event that there's a

89
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,400
chance that there's always going to be a

90
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,889
mutation that could occur an error in

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,659
the nucleotide sequence

92
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,639
well while there is checks and balances

93
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,729
to try to prevent that by having these

94
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,369
introns the hope is or the odds are if

95
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:16,709
one does occur it may occur in one of

96
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,750
these regions and be spliced out and

97
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,598
removed and basically having no impact

98
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,209
on the final mRNA contrast to that if

99
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:26,909
there was only this mature mRNA produced

100
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:30,209
every single base pair would

101
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,430
be absolutely necessary if there's just

102
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:34,379
one error somewhere it could really

103
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,819
offset the sequence or type of amino

104
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,980
acids which could make the protein

105
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:40,139
non-functional by having these introns

106
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,939
there's a chance if there is a mistake

107
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,430
it could have occur here and would not

108
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:50,219
affect the final mRNA sequence located

109
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:52,259
here okay so here the tRNA remember that

110
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,640
stands for transfer RNA it is

111
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,129
responsible transferring or bringing

112
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,169
amino acids to the ribosome hydrogen

113
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,819
bonds give them all a distinctive T

114
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:04,890
shape it actually does look like a T and

115
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:08,279
they have two attachment sites down here

116
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:10,469
we have the codon so the anticodon

117
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,289
region which is going to bind to the

118
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,320
mRNA so down here is going to where the

119
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,670
mRNA is going to be that anticodon is

120
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,860
gonna have three pairs

121
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,830
that's what's gonna bind to the

122
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,939
complimentary mRNA coming up top here

123
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:28,620
and in this region here we're gonna have

124
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:31,829
the three prime region which is where

125
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,899
the amino acids are attached and that

126
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:35,399
amino acids going to be attached there

127
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,879
and it's gonna correspond with down

128
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:41,039
below the particular codon sequence so

129
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:45,930
every tRNA does not necessarily have the

130
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:49,379
same amino acid the codon or anticodon

131
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,449
down here signals and allows only a

132
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,779
specific type of amino acid to bind

133
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:57,149
there so every tRNA has a specific

134
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,009
binding site at the mRNA region and it

135
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:03,839
will correspond with a very specific

136
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:06,839
amino acid sigma trna provides a link

137
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,668
between the mRNA and the amino acid

138
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:10,799
sequence of proteins by carrying the

139
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:13,349
amino acid we're down here is our codon

140
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,120
that are anticodon here's our tRNA and

141
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,669
our amino acid be linked up here

142
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,079
each tRNA has specific amino acid that

143
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,599
corresponds to a particular codon

144
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,449
however there are some different codons

145
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,550
that have the same amino acids to help

146
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,029
reduce the chance of change amino acid

147
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,980
sequence

148
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:35,279
there's redundancies built in our RNA

149
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:38,550
continuing with ribosomal RNA 60% the

150
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,689
ribosome by weight is our RNA the other

151
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,069
40% is some proteins

152
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:44,290
that sounds a little weird that there

153
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:46,959
takes proteins to make proteins but in

154
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,390
this case it's true there's slight

155
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,399
differences between prokaryotic remember

156
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,949
our bacterial and eukaryotic are

157
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,649
clearance in our animal cells in size

158
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:59,139
but they perform the same function this

159
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:01,929
large s in small a stands for a large

160
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:04,810
subunit and a small subunit in ProCare X

161
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,069
what's called 50s in small to 30s and

162
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:11,500
eukaryotic a large 80s and a small B 40s

163
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:13,449
the actual numbers aren't important here

164
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,029
the key part is it to understand that we

165
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,639
have a larger unit smaller unit binding

166
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:20,739
together there's a small gap located

167
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,750
right here and that's where the mRNA

168
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,670
sequence single-stranded will work its

169
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,209
way through as we're going through the

170
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:30,790
process of protein synthesis putting it

171
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:33,129
all together here we have our ribosome

172
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,840
our large subunit here our small subunit

173
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:37,360
here this is the little gap I was

174
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,359
talking about we will see mRNAs fits

175
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,100
right in there encased inside these both

176
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,710
large and small subunits we have our T

177
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,570
RNA tRNA has an amino acid and as these

178
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:48,489
come through we're building an amino

179
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,099
acid chain so you can see how these

180
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,930
three main types of RNA all come

181
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,850
together to produce a chain of amino

182
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,550
acids that will ultimately hopefully

183
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,919
produce a functional protein but I did

184
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,918
mention one more and that one was I

185
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,259
called RNA I and it stands for RNA

186
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,449
interference and it inhibits gene

187
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:10,060
expression by sound some targeted mRNA

188
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:12,639
sequences refer to a gene knocked down

189
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,339
or a silencer and this is a type of gene

190
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,800
regulation without a small single

191
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:20,109
stranded RNA so the SI stands for single

192
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,770
stranded and induces a double stranded

193
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,300
RNA d/s RNA so RNA needs to be

194
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,639
single-stranded here to be efficient the

195
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,740
copied but when we have our RNA i its

196
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,300
interfere with this process it's coming

197
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,310
through and it's binding with this mRNA

198
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,930
causing it to be double-stranded not

199
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:39,668
really allowing for it to be easily

200
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,750
replicated in the ribosome and that can

201
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:44,500
stop the production of a particular

202
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:47,289
protein this could be because the cell

203
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,759
may not need that protein do enough that

204
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:50,289
protein can be made already and it's a

205
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,029
way to stop that protein production

206
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:53,769
cells do not want to continue to keep

207
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:54,429
investing energy to produce proteins

208
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,088
that they don't

209
00:08:54,429 --> 00:09:00,039
need RNA AI is increasing the number of

210
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,170
published scientific articles back in

211
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:05,139
1978 very minimal number of articles

212
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:07,149
then we see an exponential increase to

213
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:10,600
2005 so it's not even super current data

214
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:12,759
and it's continued to just produce a lot

215
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,639
of published work it's important because

216
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:18,220
of its contributions or its the benefits

217
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:21,699
that some of this can offer declaring

218
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,959
medicine so the advantages is that it

219
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,730
could be used to target diseases with

220
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,838
minimal side effects due to the high

221
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,509
degree of specificity meaning we're

222
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,070
looking to target a particular disease

223
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,149
we don't want to kill every cell we

224
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,690
don't only want to kill the disease

225
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,909
cells well by having an RNA I the

226
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,660
potential is at least theoretically if

227
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:44,860
we found a very unique mrna sequence we

228
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:47,049
could develop these small single

229
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,180
stranded RNAs and they would bind to

230
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:51,669
that mRNA causing it to be chopped up

231
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:54,069
and basically stopping the production of

232
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:56,588
proteins for a given disease and this

233
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,600
could be very helpful now while this is

234
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:00,730
talks about the theoretical sense there

235
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,000
is some real-world applications there's

236
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,120
a timeline made to medicine so in 1986

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,129
first demonstrated potential and animals

238
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,919
in 2010 first in human Phase one

239
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:13,360
clinical trials begin now this phase 1

240
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,909
clinical trial may not mean much but I'm

241
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,060
gonna go over what these refer to phase

242
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:20,620
1 basically first to very early stages

243
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,838
both phase one and phase two clinical

244
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,230
trials show therapeutic applications in

245
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:30,220
2015 only five years for this occur is

246
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:32,649
pretty quick and in 2017 currently first

247
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,230
in humans Phase three trials begin and

248
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,328
that's a lot more advanced clinical

249
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,579
trial that's showing its passing these

250
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:41,049
certain phases so these clinical trials

251
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:44,109
what do these mean this gives you an

252
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:45,269
idea so if a zero is just very basic

253
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,589
effect on the body

254
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,240
phase one we're getting into is it safe

255
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:51,339
in humans that study can be designed to

256
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,750
terminus X the drug device in humans

257
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:55,209
usually involves a small number of

258
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,759
volunteers phase threes randomized

259
00:10:55,208 --> 00:11:00,009
trials there's a control groups compared

260
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,470
to a placebo group and it's kind of

261
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,879
tested against that we're now into Phase

262
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,800
three trials which actually is quite

263
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,698
exciting because it's testing the

264
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:10,099
large-scale safety of its

265
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:13,099
to miss these studies involve randomized

266
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,350
blind testing once phase 3 is complete

267
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,239
this is the key part a company can

268
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,319
request FDA approval for marketing of

269
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:20,569
the drug and that's when we come

270
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:22,668
available to the mass public once that

271
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:25,428
occurs and pays for trials can occur

272
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:27,828
so we're it's very exciting to know that

273
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:30,230
our nai is being involved as phase 3

274
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:32,988
trials where it could be soon released

275
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,959
to the general public to be able to help

276
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:36,619
prevent or cure or suppress certain

277
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:41,198
diseases

278
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:41,199
hopefully with very little side effects
