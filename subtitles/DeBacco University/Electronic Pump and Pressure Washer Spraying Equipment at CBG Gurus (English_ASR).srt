1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,040
any growing operation often a necessary

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,160
evil as it's often said is the spraying

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,839
of the plants this can be organic

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,798
contact sprayers and the key part with

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,960
to make these as effective as possible

6
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:15,399
is good coverage so in this tobacco

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,600
University video we're going to go out

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,719
to the CBG gurus to see how they use

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,080
both an electronic pump and experimented

10
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:24,559
with a pressure washer to be able to

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,759
efficiently spray their plants in a Time

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,118
effective and good coverage method

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,800
something that might be of interest to

14
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,920
you that you might be looking at trying

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,920
out yourself so let's take a look at

16
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:42,920
[Music]

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,079
this before we get into the video of the

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,760
content I want to just go over the

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,480
mission of the CBG gurus because they

20
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:51,920
are built around the producing a premium

21
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:53,479
Quality Craft hempt products with that

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
are manufactured in stability and

23
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,398
alignment with nature they use wood

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,920
chips to kind of suppress their weeds

25
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,399
and build soil quality as well as Korean

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,280
natural farming methods uh during the

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,478
growing season so I invite you to look

28
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,478
at their website look some of their

29
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:08,519
contact information if you have interest

30
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:10,840
um that's what we're going to see a

31
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,399
little bit of today now two parts that

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,880
we're going to look at today are their

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,920
use of both an electronic pump uh for a

34
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:20,239
spraying the hemp plants which is a more

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,159
traditional style it's a portable 9g

36
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,920
sprayer so an image of the one that they

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,359
you'll see in the video it's battery

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,079
operated and the battery does offer

39
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,879
increased mobility in the field which is

40
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:31,599
great however the misting and total

41
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,158
volume uh is limited reducing the total

42
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,158
overall coverage uh but it can be

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,600
effective however they've also gone

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,359
through some experimentation as we'll

45
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,759
see with use of a pressure washer now

46
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:43,599
it's an interesting concept because

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,879
you're able to use a large 50-gallon

48
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,039
tank that's pumped out via a pressure

49
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,798
washer the key component though to make

50
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,600
this method actually work is the

51
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,719
handheld Mis attachment to allow uh

52
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,679
grower directed spray applications and

53
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:59,319
the three nozzle improves coverage and

54
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,360
also reduces the time I tried to provide

55
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,599
the English conversion as as well as the

56
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,478
actual website here of the catalog uh

57
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,879
located right down below here as well as

58
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:08,719
in the description so you can take a

59
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,840
look at the attachment yourself but we

60
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,159
can see both of these um actually in

61
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,000
action how they're utilized in the field

62
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,639
and just gives you a idea of what you

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,840
might want to try to implement with your

64
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,639
growing operation hope you enjoy okay so

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,680
here we can see the more traditional use

66
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,919
of spraying with the electric portable

67
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,400
sprayer with a battery operated this can

68
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:30,039
be effective you can see it does have

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,200
quite a bit of force but there is only

70
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,959
one nozzle that it can support and the

71
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:38,119
length of the hose goes down most of one

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,759
row um does make it easy to transport uh

73
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,400
in the field which is something that you

74
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,039
definitely want uh because you are

75
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,239
spraying on uneven terrain uh however

76
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,479
there are other methods and this one

77
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,080
uses a pressure washer which of course

78
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,799
has much more power you can see here the

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
pressure washer on the left but what

80
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,360
makes this really work is the attachment

81
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,559
on the nozzle on the right here we can

82
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,680
see the handheld basically onoff switch

83
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,799
and the actual um attachment here uh

84
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,959
very precise I don't know exactly what

85
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,040
it says but on the back label there is a

86
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,759
website you can see circled um there

87
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,000
that'll be in the bottom of the video

88
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,039
however the pressure washer is a lot of

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,479
power as you can see knock that little

90
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,479
statue right over um too much pressure

91
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:24,598
when we first tested it here popped out

92
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,039
the end um mising nozzle however after

93
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,280
some adjustments in lowering the

94
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,239
pressure on the pressure washer uh we

95
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,799
begin to get this dialed in and we can

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,840
see here a little bit later now we

97
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,400
definitely have more of a misting don't

98
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,120
have any over pressure with losing that

99
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,200
end nozzle there we have a great misting

100
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,519
um that is occurring and we can see that

101
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,878
misting is really the key part that we

102
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,158
want advantage of pressure washer is it

103
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:52,919
is hooked up to a 50 gon uh container

104
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,919
and we have a long um hose attached here

105
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,318
and I believe two hoses attached that

106
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,000
allows easy going up and down the field

107
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:01,479
um and allows basically the stock

108
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,719
50-gallon tank to remain stationary

109
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,759
giving the operator here only the

110
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,878
basically the wand and the cord to worry

111
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,959
about and we can clearly see in that

112
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,438
Setting Sun there the coverage that

113
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,438
we're able to get also able to get the

114
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:17,238
very precise um amount of Applied

115
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,159
product that allows us to spray the

116
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,839
underside of the leaves as well as the

117
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,759
upper side and that's really a great

118
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,399
thing to allow coverage uh because

119
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,120
you're only holding the wand uh

120
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,560
basically can go under the plants really

121
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,959
easily you can see here that they're

122
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,959
nicely trained through the um trellis

123
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,959
mounted horizontally and there's the

124
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,758
kind of the overspray as well now plants

125
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,758
here a little smaller so it's easy at

126
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,280
the top but you can see it those larger

127
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,319
plants there on the right also able to

128
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,478
get that very good even coverage

129
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:48,360
reducing the amount of product applied

130
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,639
and also applying it more effectively so

131
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,800
this is something you might want to take

132
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,439
a look at uh modifying a pressure washer

133
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,400
to be able to um allly and more easily

134
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,600
spray your plants just keep in mind you

135
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,959
might want to put rollers at the end

136
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,960
there to make it easier hope this was

137
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,959
helpful
