1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,769
here I'm gonna go over a basic overview

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,359
of memory processing that occurs as we

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:09,119
see in this image you can kind of think

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,429
of the brain here is exactly motherboard

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,980
of a computer in the sense of the

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:17,789
processing of events and storing them

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,679
for recall later that occurs so this

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,980
memory processing involves kind of three

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,948
main principles it's in general memories

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,960
that storage and retrieval of

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,789
information so it's important to memory

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,410
just don't store it we also need to find

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,859
a way to be able to retrieve that

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,730
so in general storage have here

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:42,840
Kirstin state is that continually change

16
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:46,259
so we have for example our disk our

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,870
memory card our tape recorder back one

18
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,968
is a magnetic strip or memory stick all

19
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:52,679
of these different storage ways when

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,530
relating it to the electronic kind of

21
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,780
things then there's a primary processing

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,120
portion occurs this is accomplished by

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,920
the hippocampus and surrounding

24
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,069
structures and that is the actual

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,900
processing chip here in a computer so

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,339
again while relating it to computers we

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,409
want to think about that from the human

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,530
aspect that the same process and overall

29
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:18,118
process is occurring within our own body

30
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,680
the third one is memory traces these are

31
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,680
chemicals or structural changes that

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,790
encode new memory they're broken into

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,340
two parts we have short-term memory

34
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,430
which appears to be stored electrically

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,340
in the form of transient neural

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,259
excitation and then we have long-term

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,500
memory so short-term memory we're

38
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,228
talking a couple seconds to maybe a

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,879
couple minutes maybe an hour or not much

40
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:43,289
longer than that and this shows the

41
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,530
depth of memory so we see there's a

42
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,549
quick spike and then it drops down

43
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,840
ultimately short-term memory this

44
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,970
overlap would be transferred into

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,710
long-term memory which appears to

46
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:55,590
involve structural changes in certain

47
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,030
neural connections so as we see here

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,189
within our short-term memory our

49
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,950
parental lobe here in the areas of

50
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:04,078
expectation as we start to transfer

51
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,540
further down into longer-term memory

52
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,299
will notice the cerebellum here becomes

53
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,060
more active initially very little

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,230
activity there as we're approaching long

55
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,890
to remember we start to see a couple

56
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,659
dots

57
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:19,139
see a little increase in intensity

58
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,699
ultimately leading to more memory

59
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,489
processing and storage here in the

60
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:28,169
cerebellum in relation to long-term

61
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,840
memory now way to kind of relate that is

62
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:33,239
a retrieval memory memory is not a

63
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,950
snapshot stored in the brain actually

64
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,620
must be put together from information

65
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:39,239
stored in various parts of the brain so

66
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,159
it's just kind of like a bunch of puzzle

67
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,629
pieces that come together because we

68
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,969
always want to store it we also need to

69
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,799
be able to access that into the future

70
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,419
so that just a snapshot there's a bunch

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,010
of pictures stored in there it's

72
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,649
actually kind of put together as like

73
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:57,109
puzzle pieces so they can easily be

74
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,110
retrieved and accessed at a later date
