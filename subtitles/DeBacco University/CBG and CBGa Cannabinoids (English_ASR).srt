1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,759
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,759
going to go over cbg

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,519
in cbga cannabinoids and some of the

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,480
more advanced processes that these are

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,480
involved

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,000
as the plant goes through and produces

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,719
various other cannabinoids

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
and where does cbg fall in that

9
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,919
particular process

10
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,800
[Music]

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,000
all right let's get into cbg and cbga

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,920
cannabinoids

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,439
so here is a research article if you're

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,719
looking for more information on this

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,799
cannabinoid as well as

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,280
others here's the proper citation you

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,359
can go take a look at it for yourself

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
getting into the specifics of this

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,039
article this video lecture

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,399
i've derived from information from that

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,359
article as well as others

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,719
we're looking at the cbga pathway so

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,479
kind of looking at this before i get

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,039
into the details looking at cbga

25
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,640
being located right here on a quick

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,239
general sense what you're noticing is a

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,239
lot of other pathways a lot of other

28
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,759
things coming down the chain uh kind of

29
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:00,320
getting to this bottleneck a restriction

30
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,159
point

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,439
and then we have cbga and we have a

32
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,000
division from there

33
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,519
this is why cbga is so important i've

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,079
got a bunch of ancillary processes that

35
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,079
come down

36
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,200
to cbga and then there's a division step

37
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,478
from there as well

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,280
it's kind of that restriction point

39
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:18,000
molecule now that cbj is produced

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,759
you can see here from the gpp and oa by

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,799
the synthesis of aromatic uh

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,079
pyrim transferase or just

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,880
ap these biochemistry takes place in the

44
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,280
plastid

45
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,719
which is also where the net pathway

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,879
produces the gpp

47
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,719
and terpenes so we're seeing some

48
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,199
overlapped other plant

49
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,200
processes gpp shared substance in both

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,439
cannabinoids as well as terpenes again

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,960
showing some overlap in these pathways

52
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,519
within the plant

53
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,280
after the cbga is synthesized is

54
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,798
transported out of the plastid

55
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,079
to the hyaline glob into the apoplast

56
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,159
this is all occurring

57
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,919
again within that trichome structure

58
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,680
this is where the conversion of cbga to

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,519
subsequent cannabinoids takes place

60
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,360
and those subsequent quenavionoids can

61
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,039
be thca

62
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,879
or cbda the cbg cbga

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,039
is not converted into subsequent

64
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,759
cannabinoids which will accumulate in

65
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,919
the trichome now heat may cause a

66
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,280
conversion to its neutral active form

67
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:20,399
just cbg because heat will cause cbga

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,959
to basically be converted to cbg so the

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,360
taco message here is for

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,560
more familiar with potentially thc or

71
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,239
cbd

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,759
if we're looking back at the chemical

73
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,959
processes of the plant

74
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,239
it all kind of originated in the cbga

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,239
production of the plant

76
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,400
so if a plant can produce cannot produce

77
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,800
a lot of cbga or support producer

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
it is also be a poor producer of some

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,319
other potentially cannabinoids you might

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,439
be more familiar with

81
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,199
so the interaction with the cannabinoids

82
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,519
and the receptors is important

83
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,518
cbga and cbg have been shown to interact

84
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,640
with cannabinoid receptors that bind to

85
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
cbd

86
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,598
and also thc modulating their effect

87
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
so we're getting into this could also

88
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,518
potentially kind of get into

89
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
competing with effects of other

90
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,360
cannabinoids

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,878
based on how they bind specific

92
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,640
receptors in the body

93
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,479
this is why research needs to be done to

94
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,199
better understand these potential

95
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,079
interactions

96
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,359
as well as binding steps now there's

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,680
anecdotal reports

98
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
so many anecdotal reports have shown

99
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,959
that cbg

100
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,598
has similar effects to cbd medical

101
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,479
studies have shown that cbg is a potent

102
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,839
andro receptor antagonist and other

103
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,199
studies have shown cbg

104
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,920
is has antibiotic properties it is worth

105
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,119
noting that

106
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,798
all of the general side chain

107
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,959
cannabinoids have shown to exhibit

108
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,640
potential antimicrobial properties

109
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,000
so this would make sense if this falls

110
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,279
into the same category

111
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
i mentioned these are from more

112
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,080
anecdotal reports and kind of anal

113
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
reports

114
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,000
really aren't valid we need clinical

115
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,560
trials uh even though you may say that

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,479
oh

117
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,640
enough people say it must be true well

118
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,399
we need those clinical trials to

119
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,238
have a double-blind study to actually

120
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,560
prove uh potential effects

121
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,480
and maybe find other pathways or

122
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,039
sequences we may not have

123
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,878
originally considered lastly looking at

124
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,000
the cannabinoid biosynthesis

125
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,120
pathway cbj is a cannabinoid precursor

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,199
again we see all these kind of

127
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,840
cannabinoid processes going through

128
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,238
all arrows leading to cbga and then from

129
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,879
there all arrows coming from cbga

130
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,879
this bio synthesis pathway leads through

131
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,639
or at least can be restricted by cbga

132
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,319
this is why it's an important kind of

133
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,879
precursor to understand

134
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,439
not only how plants produce it but how

135
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,240
it goes

136
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,879
on to produce other compounds in the

137
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,600
plant

138
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,478
that restriction point there can be

139
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,040
vital

140
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,039
and great for future research
