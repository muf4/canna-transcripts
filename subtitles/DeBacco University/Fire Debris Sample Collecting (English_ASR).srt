1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
in this tobacco university video we're

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,519
investigating fire debris sample

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,359
collecting

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,799
so if you were to enter an area that a

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,759
fire had recently occurred how would you

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,719
go about collecting

7
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,480
samples well first off we want to be

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,359
looking at well what areas would we want

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,118
to sample

10
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,278
and we want to look at the areas that

11
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,198
are likely to contain traces

12
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,640
of ignitable liquid because this can

13
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,960
help provide

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,960
some valuable information about what may

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,839
have started or continued that fire from

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,199
going

17
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,839
areas you want to look for are like low

18
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,079
regions and burn areas depressions

19
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,479
insulated areas within a pattern poor

20
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,320
substances in contact with the pattern

21
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,479
examples of this could be like articles

22
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,359
of clothing paper products or

23
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,959
potentially

24
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,799
wood in that debris sample

25
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,039
also looking at seams or cracks it could

26
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,038
be in floors or next to walls

27
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,640
uh also important areas to be

28
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,879
investigating for potentially

29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,239
good samples lightly burned edges of the

30
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:56,558
pattern are good because they're not too

31
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,399
far

32
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,159
charred and they're not untouched they

33
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,359
kind of give you that fringe area and

34
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,079
can tell you a lot

35
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,799
about the fire there now the fire to be

36
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,478
the evidence

37
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,560
you might be looking for collecting

38
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,319
paper in trash itself if you're looking

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,079
at the you know the trash can there

40
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,559
typically does not really yield much

41
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,560
evidence we want to be looking for if

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,079
there was a use of an accelerant to aid

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,640
in a rapid start

44
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,079
was a chemical device used for example

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,118
we see the picture above me here the

46
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,200
flares

47
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,319
were they the potential start of the

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,159
fire

49
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,000
are there any signs that an electronic

50
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,640
device that could purposely

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,239
delay the initiation of a fire used

52
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,478
indicating that someone may have been

53
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,319
able to set the stage and then leave

54
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,239
and then have the fire occur when they

55
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,078
were safely out of the area

56
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,519
also unburned portions of chemical

57
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,599
electronic devices

58
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,359
may be left behind this can help again

59
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,679
provide some more

60
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,560
evidence leading to telling the story of

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
what happened with this

62
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,920
uh fire when we're collecting

63
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,359
fire debris so this is important that

64
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
along with the sample from point of

65
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,840
origin

66
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,600
a control sample should also be

67
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,600
collected this is material from a

68
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,000
different room or location it acts as

69
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,598
that good source of comparison

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
there's carpet fibers for example

71
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,519
synthetics maybe petroleum based

72
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
so again we should take some charred

73
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
remains and also

74
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,560
them from another room especially if

75
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
they're unburned to act as that

76
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,959
comparison

77
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,479
now transporting our fire debris well we

78
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,239
want to transfer the collected samples

79
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,639
into a tightly sealed container

80
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,280
typically it's a glass jar or a metal

81
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,199
can

82
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,719
kind of want to have that isolated want

83
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,199
to make sure we're labeling it

84
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,719
ideally putting some evidence tape over

85
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,359
that so we're not having anyone tamper

86
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,598
with it

87
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,920
and also indicating with an image and a

88
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,359
number where we collected that sample

89
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,000
from because it could be very important

90
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,640
later

91
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,360
in the investigation process now the

92
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,079
role of

93
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,200
accelerance so keep in mind that these

94
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,200
aid in the

95
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,238
initial ignition and potential spread

96
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,679
pattern of a

97
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,599
fire usually in debris

98
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,120
make finding it a challenge because they

99
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,079
tend to be dirty or

100
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,519
contaminated a lot of times for existing

101
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
example with gasoline

102
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,039
operates very quickly but we could

103
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,839
potentially look for if there's evidence

104
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,158
of a poor

105
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
pattern for example but these

106
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,079
accelerants can

107
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,000
really help determine that initial

108
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,280
ignition point or potentially influence

109
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,919
the pattern that that fire progresses

110
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,680
now this accelerate sample processing so

111
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,679
when we're looking at you know hopefully

112
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
identifying if an accelerant was used if

113
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,200
we do determine that to be the case

114
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
when i send that to lab in a clean

115
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,878
vapor-tight container

116
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,400
typically paint cans are used but not

117
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:40,000
plastic containers

118
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,680
you could also use a glass jar as well

119
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
we want them to be vapor tight so we

120
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
don't want that excellent to basically

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,759
evaporate

122
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,158
in its time from being recovered from

123
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,598
the scene to entering the lab

124
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,158
one of three techniques are typically

125
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,399
used heated headspace gas chromatography

126
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,598
absorption strip and solvent wash could

127
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,799
help determine

128
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:01,919
what accelerant was collected

129
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,519
now keep in mind and remember that

130
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,399
during a fire or explosion investigation

131
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,158
you don't want to forget about

132
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,640
collecting other forensic evidence such

133
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:10,560
as

134
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,318
shoe prints in the area dna tool marks

135
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,959
blood fingerprints and a whole host of

136
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,639
others

137
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,720
so just because there's clear evidence

138
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,719
of a fire being present

139
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
by all means collect the evidence

140
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,960
related to the potential fire

141
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,319
but also don't forget or don't

142
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,879
cross-contaminate

143
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,680
any other typical evidence that would be

144
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,519
collected

145
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,519
at any forensics crime scene
