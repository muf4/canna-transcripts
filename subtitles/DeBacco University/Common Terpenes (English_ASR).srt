1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,439
everyone has a particular terpene they

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,000
might be more interested in

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,080
and here on debaco university there are

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,839
specific videos on terpenes

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,679
this video though is looking at just

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,599
common terpenes looking at providing

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,000
with some great information

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,118
as a general overview looking at the

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,240
common terpenes

10
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,160
so you can develop a better

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,919
understanding in general of each

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,600
if you have interest in one or two in

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,960
particular search the channel

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,118
you might find some more detailed

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,839
information on that particular terpene

16
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,839
that is of interest to you

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,239
[Music]

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,000
all right let's go over some common

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,078
terpenes here so

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,520
we hear a lot about terpene profiles and

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
profile charts

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,359
like this table or wheel provide an easy

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,879
visual understanding in general

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,479
which terpenes produce particular

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,000
effects so you might hear a full

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,279
spectrum terpene profile that's

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,039
basically producing

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
a little bit of all the terpenes or

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,000
partial spectrum terpene profile where

30
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,558
only a few select

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,159
ones might be present in the particular

32
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,280
end product

33
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,640
so terpenes in temperature so

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,640
terpenes have different molecular

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,719
structures so their boiling points

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,960
will vary some terpenes require high

37
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,840
boiling points to turn into vapor

38
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,719
while others are in ineffective at high

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,079
temperatures

40
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,079
with the same holding true for

41
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,239
cannabinoids so here's an example that

42
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,118
thc's boiling point is 315 degrees

43
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,438
fahrenheit

44
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,920
and lionel's boiling point is 388

45
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:29,679
degrees

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,118
fahrenheit as a comparison if you're

47
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
familiar with other terpenes

48
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,438
we could see some here pining very low

49
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,399
temperature relatively speaking

50
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,000
compared to thcv having a very high

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,118
temperature here for boiling points or

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
different compounds

53
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,319
so this does play into a factor

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,159
particularly they're looking at

55
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,438
turning them into a vapor what

56
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,000
temperature you have that

57
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,919
vapor set at is going to impact the

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,359
availability potential the effect

59
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,200
that you may be getting from that

60
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,519
particular terpene it might be a little

61
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,680
bit more difficult to get uh pioneen and

62
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,920
thcv activate at the same time

63
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,118
because of just the span of temperatures

64
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,640
that they have here

65
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,800
we also see our tv and then the kind of

66
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,878
other colder temperatures to warmer

67
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,200
temperatures here relatively speaking

68
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,639
all

69
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,719
pretty hot we're talking about degrees

70
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,719
fahrenheit considering water boils at

71
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,719
212.

72
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,239
so here's just some more information and

73
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,318
again the goal here is to provide you

74
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
with some great information i'll shrink

75
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,280
myself down

76
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,199
and put myself right up here in the

77
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,080
corner so if you want to pause the video

78
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,079
or always look in the description for a

79
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,599
link to the slides as well as resources

80
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,319
if you want to download any of these

81
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,518
yourself you're more than welcome to

82
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,359
this is just to provide you with that

83
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,680
general guide in comparing

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
different terpenes again more videos on

85
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
this channel will cover them a little

86
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,598
bit more detail

87
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,359
but just just gives you a nice general

88
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,119
comparison

89
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
also some common terpenes these are ones

90
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,759
that will be discussed in other videos

91
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,280
so kind of that quick visual uh any of

92
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,959
these you want to research further

93
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
search the channel hopefully you'll find

94
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,000
a video with some more information

95
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,518
that you find helpful for you however

96
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,519
when scouring the internet there can be

97
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,519
helpful information and there can also

98
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,039
be um inaccurate or what's basically

99
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,200
unhelpful information

100
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,639
uh keep in mind that indica sativa only

101
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,719
has to do with plant morphology

102
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,559
and not chemical profile so we're

103
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,280
talking about indicas and sativas

104
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,000
yes taller slimmer longer leaves are

105
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,519
sativas

106
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,598
shorter bushier plants that are often

107
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,439
whiter or indicas we're talking about

108
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,759
head highs versus body highs sleep aids

109
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,919
creativity daytime nighttime use

110
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,120
none of this has any validity comparing

111
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,238
an indica to

112
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,680
a sativa indica sativa only has to do

113
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,080
with the morphology

114
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,680
not the chemical profile of the actual

115
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
plant

116
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,799
looking at this research article here to

117
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,479
get into some more

118
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,159
information it's another great research

119
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,679
article to kind of look at some of the

120
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:48,239
information was pulled from it but when

121
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
you look at

122
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,439
it for yourself here is the proper

123
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,759
citation

124
00:03:51,439 --> 00:04:01,840
so here we see again some more charts

125
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:01,840
and comparisons

126
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,959
so great research article here now here

127
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,959
we're seeing some more charts and

128
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,720
comparisons again just presented down

129
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,758
that research table looking at

130
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,080
form of pharmacological activity

131
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,759
cannabinoids as well as where you

132
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,159
commonly may encounter them

133
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,439
the general structure and the terpenoid

134
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,639
name listed here

135
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,719
chart was a little bit to put on just

136
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,400
one slide so this is one slide and this

137
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,680
is the second slide there giving you the

138
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,439
full kind of

139
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
gamut of everything keep in mind some

140
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,279
are not well completely understood but

141
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,198
definitely gives you at least a good

142
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,198
starting point as well as many of these

143
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,720
discussed in other videos here in debaco

144
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,879
university

145
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
now common terpenes for the ones if you

146
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,360
really want to learn about them in more

147
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,199
detail

148
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,639
these are individually covered so

149
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,079
probably just type in one of these names

150
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,519
into the search on this

151
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,758
channel should be able to find the

152
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,758
information you're looking for but again

153
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,360
as far as a comparison quick little

154
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,479
rundown of the terpene

155
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
where you're likely to find it

156
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,758
therapeutic effects and the aroma

157
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,918
typically associated

158
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,520
with that particular terpene very

159
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,918
complex a lot of people

160
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,719
great interest in this so hopefully this

161
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,240
provides you

162
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,240
with a little more information
