00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,359
welcome to debacle university where here

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,560
we're going to be looking

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:08,240
at determining and glass density

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,599
and what can it can tell us about

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,960
evidence that might be found in a crime

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,039
scene

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,639
so glass density and refractive index

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,719
are both used most successfully in

9
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,799
classifying glass particles

10
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,239
this is a class characteristics we want

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,679
to keep this in mind it's not an

12
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,239
individual characteristic it's only a

13
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,599
class characteristic this allows us only

14
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,518
to exclude

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,039
glass fragments that may have originated

16
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,639
from different sources

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
can't tell us it came from the front

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,399
window it can always tell us it came

19
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,759
maybe from a window

20
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,558
compared to maybe glass that might be in

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,000
a canning jar for example or a mirror

22
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:42,640
for example might be different types of

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,558
glass

24
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,759
so this density can allow us to classify

25
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,359
that

26
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,359
now looking at different densities or a

27
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,119
little chart here of different densities

28
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,640
window glass does not have a uniform

29
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,439
density so you want to take some

30
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,160
samples from different locations the

31
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,839
edge of

32
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,599
tempered glass is denser than the

33
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,239
interior so keep that in mind if you are

34
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
looking at

35
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,640
tempered glass and there's a database of

36
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,840
glass samples for comparison so i've

37
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,840
just provided you with a couple

38
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,400
densities here various materials

39
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,920
just for the sense of comparison keep in

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,439
mind the densest is that flint or

41
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,079
optical glass and it's got

42
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,959
7.2 grams per centimeters cubed all the

43
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,759
way down to

44
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,359
sand being only 1.52 grams per

45
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,359
centimeters cubed

46
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,400
now when we determine the density how do

47
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,079
we go about this

48
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,000
well each type of glass has a specific

49
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,118
density to allow for these comparisons

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,920
to occur

51
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,400
density capital d here is calculated by

52
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,200
dividing the mass

53
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,759
divided by the volume so keep in mind

54
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,159
that

55
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,280
we reason why this is in a heart we want

56
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,159
to think about kind of like

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,359
m over v so we look at the very top here

58
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,600
the top of the heart kind of looks like

59
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,840
an

60
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,959
m and the bottom side here kind of looks

61
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,280
like a v so it's an

62
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,158
easy way to remember it's mass over

63
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,759
volume

64
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,439
we want to do this by kind of getting

65
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,799
the weighing the substance getting the

66
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,718
mass of the particular

67
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,320
glass that we have and then the volume

68
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,078
is usually found by the displacement

69
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,039
method because its shape tends to be

70
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,959
irregular

71
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
the formula for calculating density then

72
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,359
can be applied and you can get the

73
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,199
density of the glass

74
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,639
and that can help you potentially or at

75
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,878
least narrow down

76
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,639
what type of glass you have found and

77
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,639
are looking at identifying
