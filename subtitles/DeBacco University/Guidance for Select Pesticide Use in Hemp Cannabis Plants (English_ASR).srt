1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,520
many growers want to know what

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,480
pesticides they can use on their plants

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,400
or how they can utilize them well here

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,160
at this debaco university video

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,839
we're going to take connecticut which is

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,120
a good model to use

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,439
and look at some of the guidance that

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:19,358
they offer for select pesticide use

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,358
in regards to hemp cannabis plants

10
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:27,599
[Music]

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,039
all right let's look at some guidance

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,079
for select pesticide use

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,679
in hemp cannabis plants so first off you

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,880
want to always check your local

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,039
regulations

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,800
the department of energy environmental

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,079
protection from connecticut will be used

18
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,558
in this example

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,239
and only this example the intention is

20
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,159
to offer guidance for selection of

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:46,718
pesticides in the cultivation production

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,398
of hemp

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,558
and medical marijuana in the state of

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
connecticut this guidance may be updated

25
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,558
at any time or changed

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,840
so consider this only as just that kind

27
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:59,439
of your

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,079
idea regarding this particular topic

29
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,839
so in connecticut everything must be

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,439
registered any pesticide used in the

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,560
cultivation of hemp and or medical

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,000
marijuana crops

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
must first be registered with the

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,879
department of energy and environmental

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,079
protection

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,039
abbreviated deep and may be used in the

37
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,920
state of connecticut

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,360
under six outlined conditions so what

39
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,759
are those six outline conditions

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,159
good thing you asked here are those six

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,239
outlined uh conditions that we say

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
the label must allow for the use of

43
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,798
unspecified crops and or plants

44
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,839
edgy other crops flowering plants so

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,720
this is means

46
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,159
it is used for unspecified crops other

47
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,319
crops flowering plants

48
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,079
the label must allow for the application

49
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,919
of the pesticide to the intended

50
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,519
site the greenhouse or the field where

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,680
the cannabis plants are growing

52
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,118
the label does not prohibit the use on

53
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,079
crops or plants grown for human

54
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,519
consumption

55
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,438
all labeled requirements must be

56
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,280
followed active ingredients on the

57
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,719
pesticide label must be exempt from the

58
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,439
requirement of the tolerance

59
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,000
for pesticide chemical residues on or in

60
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,718
food

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,680
per the code of federal regulations 40

62
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,640
part 180

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,840
subpart d use of any pesticide must

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,840
comply with the

65
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,920
requirements of the connecticut general

66
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,920
statutes chapter 441

67
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,439
pesticide control and regulations

68
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,519
adopted therein

69
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,680
as well as all requirements of the

70
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,599
federal worker protection standard

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,760
that's kind of all the legal mumbo jumbo

72
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,399
if you will regarding the conditions and

73
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,079
this is again

74
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
looking specifically at the state of

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,319
connecticut as an example

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,199
so we're the current um list caution

77
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,919
so dp will compile a list of pesticides

78
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,598
that can meet

79
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,439
the above criteria and those are the six

80
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,959
standards and may be used on sites where

81
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,840
hemp or medical marijuana

82
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,159
are grown or produced this less may not

83
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,080
be

84
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,359
inclusive of all pesticides that meet

85
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,800
the above criteria

86
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,080
may be updated from time to time so keep

87
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,280
in mind it is the growers

88
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,959
responsibility so growers producers of

89
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,479
hemp and medical marijuana crops are

90
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,400
responsible to determine which

91
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,479
pesticides can be used on their crops in

92
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,319
accordance with the above criteria

93
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,639
and assume all risk associated with

94
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,119
their use including possible crop

95
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,399
loss the guidance is not an endorsement

96
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,840
of any product and shall not be

97
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,480
considered gratuity or

98
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,959
efficacy without the risk of harm to the

99
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,399
crop on which it is applied

100
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,158
so what are those kind of items for

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,319
those select pesticides

102
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,679
now when it comes to that item list see

103
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,798
the description

104
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,799
in this video for links to these

105
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,319
documents here provided with the links

106

at that point in time i download them

109
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,479
and provide them in the links here

110
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,158
keep in mind though that the pdf version

111
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,959
does not contain active ingredient

112
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:38,878
information

113
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,039
and this is only current as of the

114
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,719
publication of this video

119
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,480
were

120
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,920
published or last updated september 18

122
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:04,158
with a good starting point to see

123
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,158
how your local regulations compare
