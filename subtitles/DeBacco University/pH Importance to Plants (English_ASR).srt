1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,509
see a lot of times they'll hear where I

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:05,729
was talking about pH and maintaining pH

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:07,889
or checking for pH that's because it's

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,839
very important to plants why is the

5
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,660
impact plants so much well this kind of

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,330
graph right here is very important so

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,009
look at this a little bit more detail so

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,980
again why is it part of our culture well

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,990
pH impacts nutrient availability some

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,689
nutrients become unavailable to plants

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:27,268
at low or high pH levels so here's a

12
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,329
soil range an extreme soil range a pH of

13
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:33,238
4 to pH of 10 and the thicker the bar is

14
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:35,159
the more available that nutrient is now

15
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,439
here in this blue this slightly acidic

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,089
kind of column here that's where we

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,859
typically like to keep most P ages

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,809
you'll notice we kind of follow down

19
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,789
this range most nutrients are available

20
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,769
in the greatest amounts and this is why

21
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,689
it's important to plants so look at

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,170
nitrogen is for example here as we get a

23
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:54,839
pH kind of below 6 especially 5.5 its

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,879
availability becomes much less same

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,760
thing as if we get that pH soil above 8

26
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:02,009
the nitrogen in soil inherently becomes

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,890
less available to plants we see the

28
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:08,009
opposite here with some nutrients n or

29
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,790
more for acidic loving plants so for

30
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,430
example boron very thick here and 2 5

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,439
still maintains really thick and here if

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,750
we're a pH 8 or above becomes a lot less

33
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,429
available iron is kind of like the

34
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,159
opposite triangle here where once we get

35
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,070
a below pH of around you know around

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,609
that 6 2 to 6 and lower we see it's of

37
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:31,289
Exim amount availability molybdenum is

38
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,569
kind of the opposite where it's more

39
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,770
available at a basic range so plans such

40
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,319
as like blueberries that like that more

41
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,390
acidic range well they're liking the

42
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,908
iron in particular and some copper and

43
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,439
some other metals here so this is why pH

44
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,570
is so important because you can see over

45
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,739
different ranges how these nutrients

46
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:51,118
availability is greatly impacted and

47
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,089
here's how it kind of looks on the large

48
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,099
scale because the pH can determine in

49
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,350
amendments that needs to be used you can

50
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,169
indicate it's advantageous or necessary

51
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:03,030
to adjust pH level so x i'm sometimes if

52
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,219
there's like nutrient deficiencies are

53
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,068
nutrient issues one it could be low

54
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:10,049
amounts of that present in the soil or

55
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,509
it could be low amounts of that nutrient

56
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,800
available to plants in that soil so

57
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:16,889
sometimes simply adding lie

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,960
or sulfur to correct the pH can correct

59
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:20,219
nutrient deficiencies because those

60
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,020
nutrients that are already present the

61
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,020
soil become plants available
