1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
here when I take a brief overview of the

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,470
animal phylum Chordata the title slide

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,719
image here we see the glass catfish

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:12,750
which is one of the few chordates with a

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,699
visible backbone now of course they're

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,309
improving on the skeleton they exhibit a

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:19,799
truly internal endoskeleton with muscles

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,108
attached to an internal rod called the

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,600
notochord is that evidence here in the

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,490
cartoon image in this red line here the

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,590
innovation opened the door for a large

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:30,989
body size is not possible of early

13
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,689
animal forms how looks kind of in real

14
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,420
life here we see a great image here

15
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:39,269
we're looking at the 40 notochord cells

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,309
are highlighted in a red here now this

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,710
is immunofluorescence so that's why

18
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,299
they're glowing red in this image can

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,520
read about it here but that's just

20
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,738
showing you that line is indicating

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,190
where the notochord is located in this

22
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:55,649
particular individual yeah I said large

23
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,479
increase in size and based on if you

24
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,219
watch the videos in the correct order

25
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,909
you can see all of these animals are

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,710
much larger

27
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,018
they all have internal scale he's either

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,780
made of bone or cartilage and that is

29
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,180
what the muscles are working against

30
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,859
most endoskeletons are made of column we

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,780
get a couple here for example the shark

32
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:15,390
where we have set more of that cartilage

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,650
intact but most of these contain that

34
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,109
internal skeleton made of bone now

35
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,030
there's approximately 56,000 species of

36
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:25,709
chordates they all share these four

37
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,629
principal features at least some point

38
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,039
in their life maybe not at all stages

39
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,500
but at some point they'll have all of

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,460
these the presence of a notochord a

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,799
nerve cord pharyngeal pouches in a post

42
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,139
anal tail this kind of creates a little

43
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,170
bit of a detailed form this has an

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,840
individual here living in an aqueous

45
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,000
environment looking at some a little

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,890
more detail in this case but this gives

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,899
you an appreciation for the complexity

48
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,769
of some of these animals next slide here

49
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,099
I'm gonna give it just kind of that

50
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:59,310
brief overview and we see that here so

51
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:03,140
we have the four main common features

52
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,879
that notochord that nerve cord

53
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,368
pharyngeal slits in a post a male tail

54
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,739
and keep in mind they may may not all

55
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:12,780
exist at the same time but in order to

56
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,590
fit into this phylum they have to exist

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,050
at some

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,580
point in the animals life cycle now

59
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,959
improving on the skeleton will not all

60
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,090
crates actually vertebrates

61
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,000
these are actually two examples of ones

62
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,299
that aren't vertebrates tunicates here

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,239
have a unique look to them and lancelet

64
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:37,920
here these are two examples of chordates

65
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:39,480
that aren't vertebraes with p speaking

66
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,280
of raised vertical rates have two

67
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,619
important aspects and it's a great image

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,110
here vertebrates have a backbone that

69
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,000
replaces the role of the notochord see

70
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,519
that here firm eights also have a

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,579
distinctive well-defined head region and

72
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,500
this is two distinguishing factors for

73
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:58,579
vertebrates that fit under the animal

74
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,579
phylum chordates
