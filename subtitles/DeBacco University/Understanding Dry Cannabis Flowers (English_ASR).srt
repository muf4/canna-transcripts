1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
so if you want to learn more about dry

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,919
flour cannabis

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,919
this tobacco university video is for you

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:15,678
[Music]

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
all right let's go over understanding

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,320
dry cannabis flowers

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
and first off i want to thank ct pharma

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,879
here

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,719
uh special thanks for making their

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,239
information analytical reports product

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,759
labels and information publicly

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,159
available online

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,640
the descriptions provided here will give

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,320
you some insight into dry flour cannabis

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,320
and also kind of what an analytical

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,200
report an example of one is

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,039
so you can be an informed consumer so

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,160
looking at just the general description

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,079
of dry flour products well dry flower

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,279
cannabis is looking at large clusters of

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,039
dense plant material

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,359
filled with numerous medical benefits

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,879
mainly green but dependent on the

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,439
cultivar can be filled with

25
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,960
color hues of purple and orange as well

26
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,039
so don't think that it always has to be

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,239
green there can be a lot of anthocyanins

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,760
will be associated with a purple

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,119
coloration that you may see

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,399
there's many different cultivars all

31
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,518
with individual names different

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,719
cannabinoid percentages

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,320
and unique terpene profiles so

34
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,319
just don't get locked in there's only

35
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,199
one particular image that you need to

36
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,839
find

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
to show good dry flour so what's a

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,799
description of

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,320
dry flour just in general is basically

40
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,840
the flowers harvested from the

41
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,438
best i put that in quotes part of the

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,159
plant and is

43
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,158
hand-picked based on quality this should

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,359
come with a certificate of analysis and

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,359
a label on the product

46
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,118
if it does not come with one you should

47
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,040
be sure to definitely request one and

48
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,438
you'll see an example of one in this

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
lecture series an example will be

50
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,478
provided here

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,560
later you can go through and research at

52
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,719
least this one was provided at the

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,640
current point in time

54
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,319
so keep in mind there is dry flower

55
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,680
variety there's hundreds of different

56
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,359
cultivars

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,280
all with different terpene profiles with

58
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,040
different effects main groups are your

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,879
sativas your indicas your hybrids but

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,920
there's also technically your auto

61
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,399
auto flowers or wood wireless prices can

62
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
range

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,840
so again don't get locked in any one

64
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,759
thing

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,920
there are a lot of options and that's a

66
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,719
good thing the canada concentrations

67
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
range from 10 percent up towards the 35

68
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,479
thc

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,000
thc and cbd mixes are also available

70
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,519
this just shows you down here some of

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,878
the morphology of the leaves of the

72
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,280
plants

73
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,959
so what's the uses for dry flour well

74
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,080
it's one of the most popular choices at

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,680
dispensaries

76
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,440
as it's easy to use can be smoked

77
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,800
vaporized for access to

78
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,479
medical effects very quickly and easily

79
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
effects could be felt within seconds to

80
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,399
minutes after consumption

81
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,119
and it also offers easy storage since it

82
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
can be kept

83
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,800
at room temperature and is a fairly

84
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,120
stable product

85
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,840
here's an example of a certificate of

86
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,080
analysis

87
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,360
so again this is just showing you uh

88
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,959
looking at the testing

89
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,879
so here looking at the certificate of

90
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,080
analysis we can see there's microbial

91
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,639
parameters testing

92
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
heavy metal testing mycotoxin testing

93
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,079
pesticide testing

94
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,000
and we can see a pass on all these it

95
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,000
also gives the results

96
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,039
uh recommended limits so this is all

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,959
good information

98
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,479
should be getting with any flower you're

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,479
looking at purchasing

100
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,598
in addition you're looking at terpenes

101
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,759
and cannabinoids

102
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,518
also expressed here but keep in mind

103
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,079
while most people will go to this

104
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
we also have to be mindful with that dry

105
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
flower

106
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,079
we need to be mindful of microbial

107
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,680
analysis heavy metals mycotoxins and

108
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,200
pesticides as well

109
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,879
as the terpenes and cannabinoids we

110
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,798
might be interested in what does the

111
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,439
label look like was just one example

112
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,040
here

113
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,120
again give you some of that summary

114
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,318
there of some of the components

115
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,640
keep in mind that they do give the

116
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:37,039
general quick summary of the past all

117
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,839
the micro toxins heavy metals micro

118
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,199
uh micro biological and chemical residue

119
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,680
testing there

120
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,518
but even beyond the label you have the

121
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,519
right as a consumer to go back and ask

122
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,400
for a certificate of analysis here to

123
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
confirm that

124
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,158
and make sure the lot numbers match up

125
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,199
so this provides you just a little bit

126
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,199
more information

127
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,560
about dry flour so you can be an

128
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,560
informed consumer
