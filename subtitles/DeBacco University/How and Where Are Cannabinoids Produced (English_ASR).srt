1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,759
in this tobacco university video where

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,318
we're going to get into

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,838
how and where are cannabinoids produced

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,080
we're getting to some really

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,599
in-depth scientific research articles as

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,638
well which might be a little bit more

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,120
advanced

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,559
than some people may want to know but at

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,000
least here you can get some good

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,079
detailed information

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,118
look at some good images and if you just

12
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,278
want the basics

13
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:31,839
that'll be provided here also on this

14
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:31,839
video lecture

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,320
all right let's get into the detail on

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,039
how and where are cannabinoids

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,558
produced in cannabis plants so first off

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,399
here's a great research article that

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,280
you're welcome to take a look at

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,759
the images will be provided from here uh

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,359
and

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,000
again to provide you with that extra

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,960
level of detail then just a quick simple

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,719
answer

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
however i realize many of you are

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,359
probably here for that quick and simple

27
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:56,479
answer so

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,679
uh when we're looking at where these

29
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,679
canonies are produced while

30
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,238
phytocannabinoids are synthesized

31
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,198
in the capital like stocked granular

32
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,759
trichomes

33
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,039
or the csg as they'll be referred to and

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,560
this is kind of the structures that they

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
look like that's the quick answer if

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,519
that's all you wanted

37
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,359
you're welcome to depart from the video

38
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,399
at this time we have a lot more detail

39
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,840
to get into

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
now what i've provided here is some

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,719
great um images uh to be able to really

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,320
look

43
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:24,879
at the details of provided in these uh

44
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,359
trichome structures and we're looking at

45
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,478
light

46
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,599
micro microscopy and a and b so

47
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,679
typically what you might

48
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,599
be used to seeing uh we're looking kind

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
of a side shot as well looking at like a

50
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,759
top

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,759
down shot there of the cross sections

52
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,359
then we're also getting into some sem

53
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,200
which is some scanning electron

54
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,840
microscope images which provide

55
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
great level of detail almost looks like

56
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
something kind of

57
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
from space here and we're seeing kind of

58
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,960
the

59
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,399
scale bars and give you an idea of size

60
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,078
we'll look at some of the definitions

61
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,239
here of all the letters correspond with

62
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,319
basically the caption presented here

63
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,839
we'll go through and read it all but it

64
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,118
does give you if you do have an image

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
you're really interested in

66
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,879
match it up over here and you can find

67
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,159
out some more detail

68
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,318
a little more detail and maybe you want

69
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,400
to understand but basically trichomes is

70
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,238
what we're looking at here

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,520
so looking at the trichome development

72
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,759
to kind of

73
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,439
pull back if you will chemist trichomes

74
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,840
because as a salsa glands

75
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,719
lacking a stock and they start near the

76
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,800
surface

77
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,560
of the floral or leaf epidermis remember

78
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,680
epidermis like our epidermis is kind of

79
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
the outer skin

80
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,439
on both the adaxial and epidaxial

81
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,319
sides the top and bottom of the um leaf

82
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,199
surface

83
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,359
and plant surface uh these cecil glenoid

84
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,919
trichomes are present on the vegetative

85
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,680
plant

86
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,079
but they are not expressing the

87
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,760
synthesis for cannabinoid production

88
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,000
or monoterpenes they produce primary uh

89
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,000
subsequent terpenes there kind of like

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
the early early stages there

91
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,878
this kind of shows you just some great

92
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,680
images here really looking at some

93
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,239
detail

94
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
uh with on the cannabis leaf surface at

95
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,439
those trichomes

96
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,799
now production of these academics will

97
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,878
only occur

98
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,239
at certain points so they only occur

99
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,878
when the plant reaches

100
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,158
floral maturity do these cecil trichomes

101
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,280
begin to grow stalks

102
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,479
kind of see here and become that csg

103
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,039
kind of

104
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,039
trichomes and only during this phase

105
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,239
does it begin to produce cannabinoids as

106
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,679
well as terpenes

107
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,959
so this is why we don't want to harvest

108
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,560
plants too early because if the

109
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,479
trichomes are underdeveloped

110
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
well so are the cannabinoids so are the

111
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,679
terpenes going to be very low in

112
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,439
concentration

113
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,280
so trichome example image you know kind

114
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,039
of looking at kind of the large scale

115
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,959
kind of more of a zoomed in version

116
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,239
the little crystals on the flower are

117
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,199
actually those uh

118
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,319
capitae stocked granular trichomes those

119
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,158
csgs

120
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,238
which sparkle when they catch the light

121
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,598
especially when they're dried these are

122
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,640
the structures we really want to be

123
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,639
careful with

124
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,158
as far as avoid damaging they're also

125
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,158
located right here we can kind of see

126
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,919
that zoomed in version right here

127
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:59,280
of how the density of the trichomes is

128
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:02,318
quite high in this particular image

129
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,598
so these csgs close-up picture here

130
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,199
within the glans are secondary

131
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:05,919
metabolite excretions which are the

132
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,238
primary

133
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,958
the cannabinoids are going to be present

134
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,120
in these

135
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,959
structures so again these are ray

136
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,560
structures they are three-dimensional

137
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,319
we don't want to do any damage to these

138
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,759
and this is why that handling of the

139
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,798
final dried flower

140
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,720
is so delicate and important

141
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,560
now more detailed images again i think

142
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,280
these are also great

143
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
to kind of give you that kind of really

144
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,638
advanced

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,079
level and look at some trichomes and

146
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,600
we're looking at the flowers here and a

147
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,599
kind of stained

148
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,520
different images these stock granular

149
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,879
trichomes and mature canvas flowers have

150
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,639
a proliferation of cells

151
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,159
and their secretory discs looking kind

152
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,240
of the interior portions

153
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,479
these cecil trichomes with greater than

154
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,879
eight gland cells will develop these

155
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,560
csgs and are typically located on the

156
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,439
calyx which is the structure of the

157
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,680
flower

158
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,279
only csg trichomes produce cannabinoids

159
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,800
and monoterpene so it's very important

160
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,079
we have as many of those as possible

161
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,360
since they're the only structures

162
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,399
responsible for producing the

163
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,160
cannabinoids

164
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,439
if we're looking at the details of these

165
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,400
images again you're kind of not looking

166
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,879
from the side you're kind of looking at

167
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,239
the top

168
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,399
down and we see the kind of description

169
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,680
provided here for all of those and then

170
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,959
it also provide a little bit more of a

171
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600
macroscopic image

172
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,198
and appreciation for the level of detail

173
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,120
provided here

174
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,560
then there's granular trichomes again

175
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,319
looking at another great kind of

176
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,399
detailed image

177
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,159
there of some of these these granular

178
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,319
trichomes exhibit distinct

179
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,360
intrinsic inflorescence and metabolite

180
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,959
organization

181
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,639
csg is developed from those cecil

182
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,680
granular trichomes and here we're seeing

183
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,600
some side shots

184
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,720
as well cecil trigons produce

185
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,759
predominantly

186
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,639
the terpenes these subsequitarian

187
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,360
terpenes

188
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,160
and minimal cannabinoids and produce red

189
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,439
auto

190
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,280
fluorescence that we see here the csgs

191
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,879
produce cannabinoids and monoterpenes

192
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,719
and produce blue autofluorescence as we

193
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,519
kind of see here so that staining also

194
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
goes through

195
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,680
and we see them kind of average

196
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
intensity here of our intrinsic

197
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,600
fluorescence and trichomes different

198
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,680
wavelengths being produced

199
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,280
and we see the degree and there are some

200
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,560
variations i don't think that's just

201
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,559
this is a perfect curve there are some

202
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
degree of variations there

203
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,240
but just to kind of get an appreciation

204
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,280
for different wavelengths

205
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,319
average intensity here and the intrinsic

206
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,758
inflorescence

207
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,600
now if we're looking at the images some

208
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,000
great images some great really detailed

209
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,639
images

210
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,120
again the kind of caption provided here

211
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,120
below

212
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
to provide you some of that detail as

213
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,840
presented in that research article to

214
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
kind of

215
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,079
show you that level of advanced level of

216
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,079
complexity here

217
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,639
so another kind of morphological kind of

218
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,240
look here um these sem images scanning

219
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,160
electron microscope images really

220
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,600
detailed images of the morphology of

221
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
three different types of glandular

222
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,479
trichomes

223
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,000
we have uh again d e and f here

224
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,758
we have the stock cecil and then the

225
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,720
bulbas located right here

226
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
keep in mind we are looking at the

227
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,360
epidermis there so we're looking at

228
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,879
structures that are raised from the

229
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,479
epidermis

230
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:00,319
the unique features of these particular

231
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,680
trichomes we can kind of see image right

232
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,360
here the canvas

233
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,759
csg trichomes are responsible for

234
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,520
cannabinoid and monoterpene biosynthesis

235
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,680
these are the sites where those are

236
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,758
being produced this does require gland

237
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,439
cells in a secretory cavity

238
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,038
so within those structures what you're

239
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,120
looking at you know that cloudy

240
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,800
appearance or amber appearance or clear

241
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,720
appearance this is kind of what's going

242
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,960
on inside of those regions

243
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
there's genetic mechanisms regulating

244
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,000
the biochemical and morphological

245
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,960
changes that occur

246
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,240
during the csv trichome development and

247
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,918
really they're not

248
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,319
that well understood we know that they

249
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,639
occur but not really well understood so

250
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,800
an

251
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,400
area great for future scientific

252
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,400
research to be done

253
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,638
and we can kind of see the location

254
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,478
really close to eight disk cells here

255
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,319
and then we see that building of that

256
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,359
initial stock and that true stock

257
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,598
developed here

258
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,120
it's what's occurring within here that

259
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,680
the plant is regulating

260
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
that development of those cannabinoids

261
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,199
as well as those

262
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,240
terpenes so exactly the genes are

263
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,400
responsible for that

264
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,519
again not well understood but a great

265
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,918
area here for

266
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,359
scientific discovery going in forward in

267
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,079
the future

268
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,000
it was just kind of a zoomed out version

269
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,519
of kind of a grain layer trichome

270
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,120
again occurring on that leaf surface

271
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,560
these cecil glinter trichomes will have

272
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,560
secretory vesicles

273
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,319
encapsulated by a waxy cuticle keep in

274
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,120
mind the outside portion

275
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,080
of plants is waxy lipid-based and has to

276
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,319
be water repellent

277
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,519
much like our own skin we produce a lot

278
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,160
of oils and lipids

279
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,878
very water repellent this waxy cuticle

280
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,039
will contain

281
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,399
several smaller vesicles which are

282
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,879
extracellular components

283
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,240
separated by apple plastic space so

284
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,679
we're kind of getting that development

285
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
of these three-dimensional structures

286
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,038
within

287
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,959
or with on top of that epidermis the

288
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,799
entire vesicle apparatus is attached to

289
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,799
a rosette of gland cells

290
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,319
which are themselves connected to the

291
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,319
rosette of striped cells

292
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,560
which are connected to a basal cell

293
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,720
which is connected to the stock cells

294
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,759
so we're having these multiple kind of

295
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,040
building blocks

296
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,759
to create that stocked alt trichome in

297
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,199
the end

298
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,639
the stock contains cells which are

299
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,320
designed to pump substrates into the

300
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,720
secretory cell rosette

301
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
which again in this area up here where

302
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,000
typically growers are looking to be

303
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
whether it's cloudy or amber color

304
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,120
this is the actual location they're

305
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,639
looking at where they look at the

306
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,679
coloration change because there's some

307
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,759
indication

308
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,879
to when the cannabinoids are being

309
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,240
produced within those glycotricones

310
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,679
now hopefully if you stuck together this

311
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,360
long our last little bit here are

312
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,599
secretory cells

313
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,120
the plastids within the secretory cells

314
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,440
produce the cbga

315
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,720
and terpenes which are then transported

316
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,480
through the cell wall

317
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,320
into the secretory vesicles where they

318
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,200
form what auburn describes as high lean

319
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
areas

320
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,120
which form secretory vesicles in that

321
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,039
area these little bulbs

322
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
uh these little bubbles are where the

323
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,919
secretory secondary metabolites are

324
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,639
synthesized

325
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,919
and then stored cbga is produced in the

326
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,000
secretory cell

327
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:53,360
plastid and then exported into the

328
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,600
secretory vesicle

329
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,440
for further manipulation by proteins

330
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,480
called synthases and this is looking at

331
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,640
enzymes

332
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,639
all occurring in that one little top

333
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,240
bulbous uh category there

334
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,799
most growers just look at as a cloudy is

335
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,320
it clear there is a lot going on

336
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,000
in that region a lot more than i think

337
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,959
most growers realize and maybe

338
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,799
appreciate

339
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,439
hopefully future scientific discoveries

340
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,000
can unlock some of the pathways here

341
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
so we can better understand exactly

342
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,799
what's going on in these

343
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,800
trichome structures
