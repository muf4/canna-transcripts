1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,759
in this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,599
going to answer the question what are

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,480
terpenoids and how do they relate to

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,480
cannabinoids

5
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:16,239
[Music]

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,080
all right so let's get to answering the

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,399
question what are terpenoids and how do

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,719
they relate to cannabinoids

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,759
so first off terpenes versus trypanoids

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,358
here what's kind of the general

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,359
comparison and this is a great kind of

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,800
difference between for definition

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,719
structure types and uses however these

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,880
are often used as interchangeable terms

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,399
but they do have different definitions

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,320
and we can see different classifications

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,480
and categories terpenes

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,159
are the naturally occurring combination

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,558
of carbon and hydrogen

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,000
terpenoids are terpenes that have been

21
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,079
modified through a drying

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,679
and curing process basically that's a

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,198
chemical modification

24
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,719
and what that does is that alters the

25
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,320
oxygen content

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,640
of the compound so we're talking about

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,558
on the molecular level there

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,399
terpeneites are a subset of terpenes

29
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,038
that contain additional functional

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,558
groups

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,640
and these functional groups could have

32
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,359
been added uh to produce a desired

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,680
effect

34
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,040
or it could be a nash occurring in the

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,479
drying process

36
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,720
so here we have the structure again

37
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,560
terpenes simple hydrocarbon compound

38
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,079
terpenoids hydrocarbon compound with

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,079
oxygen containing

40
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,840
functional groups kind of an important

41
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,599
structural uh difference

42
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,920
there as well as the other differences

43
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,438
you see listed right here

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,118
so what are terpenes then what are kind

45
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,000
of let's look at just the the general

46
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:29,680
sense what are

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,359
um terpenes because we've heard probably

48
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,360
that term referred to quite a bit

49
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,799
in terpenes are organic hydrocarbons

50
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,200
found in essential oils

51
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,880
of plants and chemist terpenes are

52
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,118
produced in the trichomes of the plant

53
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,959
it's what provides the unique scent

54
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,799
the terpene smell allows us to make

55
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,118
inferences about the strain and possible

56
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,200
physiological effects that it may have

57
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,399
we see the five most common listed here

58
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,159
and kind of a

59
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,239
standardized approach we see a lot of

60
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,680
wheels being used with terpenes

61
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,839
to help again create a good comparison

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,759
in an organized format and more of these

63
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,680
terpenes will be described in details

64
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,280
on other videos here on debaco

65
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
university

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,318
so what can impact terpenes just in

67
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,239
general

68
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,759
well the reason plants develop terpenes

69
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,878
in the first place is to attract

70
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,439
pollinators or

71
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,878
reject predators research suggests that

72
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,878
these compounds can have

73
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,239
medical properties so they might be

74
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:21,598
important for human use

75
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,360
now what can impact them while the

76
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,719
growing environment the growing

77
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,319
substrate and the time that you go

78
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,000
through and harvest them

79
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,759
now here we're seeing kind of a

80
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,080
comparison again provided by a company

81
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,560
so

82
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
take it for what it's worth looking at

83
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,800
our standard kind of

84
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,280
lighting and then adding uva and uvb

85
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
light

86
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
and the alterations in terpene

87
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,400
concentrations

88
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,000
and they kind of give all of the values

89
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,439
here and we can see the total terpene

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
concentrations

91
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,239
are particularly higher for mycin and

92
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,878
limonene increased by 40 to 50 percent

93
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,560
with the addition of uva and uvb light

94
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,598
just one example here on just that

95
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,519
growing environment

96
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,679
can change the amount of terpenes

97
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,719
produced not to mention the substrate or

98
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,480
the time that you select a harvest

99
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,840
so identified terpenes again this is

100
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,560
hopefully not too confusing it's meant

101
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,158
to be

102
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,000
a really kind of interesting way to kind

103
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,919
of provide an organization

104
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
as there are over a hundred different

105
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,199
identified terpenes

106
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,719
in the cannabis plant and while the

107
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,439
differences can be subtle

108
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,199
there are classification systems put in

109
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,719
place to reduce confusion

110
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,158
general smell classifications we see

111
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:29,759
like the spicy and the kind of the sour

112
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,158
collection we see also the earthy smells

113
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,959
the

114
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,719
sweet smells again it's commonly shown

115
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,120
on a terpene wheel to try to try to

116
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,239
develop that organization presented

117
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,239
now i consider this to be a little bit

118
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,959
more of an improved wheel by terpene

119
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,878
type and not smell classify them and to

120
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,680
give you more information about each of

121
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,439
them

122
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,200
to give you the boiling points of them

123
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,039
the aromas the effects they're what

124
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,919
they're also found in in the key medical

125
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,598
benefits

126
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:58,079
as well as some strains that may have

127
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,518
favor that particular type of terpene

128
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
these derping categories are an

129
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
improvement

130
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,360
method of organization over the aroma

131
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,039
given off it's kind of a little bit of

132
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,400
non-scientific way

133
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,840
this presentation also includes

134
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,280
additional properties for each for

135
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,598
improved comparisons

136
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,120
to be easily made what are the boiling

137
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,438
points are they different what are the

138
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,840
general aromas also included but not the

139
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,519
main way of organization

140
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,198
so how terpenes relate to cannabinoids

141
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,040
to get to that central question there

142
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,960
technically speaking phytocannabinoids

143
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,759
are a form of a terpenoid

144
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,159
they are metro terpenoids meaning they

145
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,879
have

146
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,600
a partial terpenoid structure much of

147
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,199
the commercial

148
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
commercial and therapeutic value of

149
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,960
cannabis comes from the aromatic

150
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,638
mono terpenes which have synergistic

151
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,638
effect when consumed

152
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,478
furthermore the aromatic therapeutic

153
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,720
effects of monoterpenes

154
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,918
have been clinically shown effective

155
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,759
this kind of shows you the

156
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,560
quote marijuana which is you're above

157
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,479
0.3 thc in your hemp

158
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,680
from a federal standpoint what they can

159
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,120
both produce they both can produce

160
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,720
cannabinoids and terpenes different

161
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,519
percentages different

162
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,880
combinations so again knowing your

163
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,599
cannabis plant and doing what it could

164
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,800
produce

165
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
that's how terpenes can relate to

166
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,120
cannabinoids they are both produced by

167
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
the cannabis plant

168
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,918
and this brings us to the entourage

169
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,199
effect which is some more is another

170
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,079
video on this channel goes into this in

171
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,600
more detail

172
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,758
but in general the entourage effect

173
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,240
describes a mechanism where cannabis

174
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,000
substances work together to optimize the

175
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,639
overall psychoactive benefits of the

176
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,478
plant

177
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,639
the idea is that you want to find the

178
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,359
best terpenes to cannabinoid ratio

179
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,199
possible

180
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,319
for your desired effect because as we

181
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,439
see here all these dotted lines all

182
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,560
these connections

183
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,879
there is a web here of of interactions

184
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,560
not just one thing that's kind of

185
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,399
systematically leading to another thing

186
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,918
there's a bunch of interactions that can

187
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,879
occur and understanding those

188
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,359
interactions

189
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,719
can create a more beneficial medicinal

190
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,639
purpose

191
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,919
so this all comes back to the very end

192
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,079
here the importance of

193
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,519
testing so not every plant in the given

194
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,359
strain will have the same levels of

195
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,599
terpenes to the expression of individual

196
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,639
plants phenotypes as well as the growing

197
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
environment

198
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,918
the only way to be sure is through a

199
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,799
terpene analysis

200
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,198
from a cannabis testing laboratory so be

201
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
sure

202
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,079
anything you're looking at purchasing

203
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,680
make sure you're getting these

204
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,758
certificate of analysis

205
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,280
they look slightly different yes it's

206
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,560
important to look at the terpene profile

207
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,559
it's important look at the cannabinoids

208
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,600
but also make sure that it's passing

209
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,879
tests for

210
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,800
heavy metals pesticides

211
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,240
microbiology things like that to ensure

212
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,919
you're getting a clean product

213
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,280
as well as a product that also has a

214
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,279
particular profile

215
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,279
that you deem desirable
