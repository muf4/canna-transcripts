1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,318
you're looking at the high-intensity

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:06,330
discharge or a light ballast and what

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,830
those are the areas here we see the

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,660
cooling fins and this is where the

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,730
electricity is plugged into and this is

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,080
what feeds the bulb you can see in the

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,690
background here on different type of

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,460
valves by a different manufacturer this

9
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:19,050
is a ceramic metal halide you can see

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,150
about a cleaner whiter look to the light

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,630
this is a high-pressure sodium by it's

12
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:27,479
yellow light so these HID light these

13
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,250
ballasts that are required to have these

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,170
valves regulate the wire voltage for

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,780
specifically have it set up and be sure

16
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,520
to purchase quality ballasts it's highly

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,520
recommend you purchase the entire system

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,290
at once reduce the risk of fire from

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,540
mixing and matching different components

20
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,280
together so a lot of times manufacturers

21
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,769
now are kind of selling it all-inclusive

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,390
but if you do buy it separate ballasts

23
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,460
be sure everything is compatible that

24
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,710
you're buying at the time of purchase so

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,520
you don't have a mix match and just

26
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,079
increase your potential for fire hazard

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,690
keeping you balanced cool well he is a

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,948
great contributor to the aging abouth so

29
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,588
keep them in an area that allows for

30
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:07,408
cooling and air circulation keep them

31
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:09,510
away from potential sources of water so

32
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,820
here we have a lot of growth facilities

33
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,380
we have a lot of typically tanks of

34
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,599
water you want to make sure your ballast

35
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,030
are mounted clear and far away from

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,069
these sources now were what will be

37
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,978
present but also where humidity could be

38
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,228
high there's two different types there's

39
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,728
magnetic and there's electronic magnets

40
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:28,769
have greater noise and weight compared

41
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,269
to electronic ballasts if they'll smoke

42
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:32,759
and a horrible odor and these aren't

43
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,158
really being phased out latronnik fail

44
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,750
by simply stop working which is great

45
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,520
much preferred because they were in

46
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,670
cooler and quieter than the magnetic

47
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,810
ballasts ballast location so we

48
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,850
mentioned want to keep them away from

49
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,379
water so traditional thought was to

50
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:49,349
mount them outside the room to make

51
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,810
cooling easier but due to line loss in

52
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,780
the power the lights do not work as

53
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,310
efficiently now all in one ballast bowl

54
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,680
the reflector units are the kind of the

55
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,030
standard and we can see that here we're

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,340
having all our ballast all our lights

57
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,868
all together versus putting them in the

58
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,000
hallway here where it's easier to cool

59
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:07,500
while running that power all with of

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,270
those lights and the grow room might

61
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,370
just be another side of the wall but

62
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,920
that requires a line loss and that's

63
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,099
reducing the efficiency of those lights

64
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,589
increasing power consumption and without

65
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:21,719
pain increased necessarily in the yield

66
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,370
or the amount car that's produced by

67
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,800
those lights so now these all-in-one

68
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,189
options are by far the preferred way to

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,189
go
