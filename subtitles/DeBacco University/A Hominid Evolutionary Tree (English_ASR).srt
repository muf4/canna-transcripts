1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,280
so here we're going over a hominid

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,759
evolutionary

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,599
tree and kind of giving you some

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,719
background information

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,759
on some of the predecessors to the

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,759
modern day homo sapiens so first off we

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,839
want to look at the hominid evolutionary

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,079
tree and there are two major groups

9
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,278
of hominids the genus homo is about

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,320
comprised of about three to seven

11
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,239
species depending

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,359
exactly how you count them or classify

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,439
them the astrological has

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,640
seven species in their older and smaller

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,238
brained

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,000
these characteristics are bipedal

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,640
they're about a meter tall

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
about 18 kilograms in weight and you can

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,558
see kind of these

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,159
different kind of structures to these

21
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,439
individuals here

22
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,279
in comparison to the homo genus

23
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,558
you can see the brain size is different

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,198
as well as the

25
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,919
general structure and size of the

26
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,079
individual

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,120
on average we could see this genre of

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,799
the species this

29
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,519
subdivision so we're getting more

30
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,599
specific as we kind of break this apart

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,520
fossils for these are only found in

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,198
africa and the brains are not any larger

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,719
than those if you compare them

34
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,319
to apes now within the early human

35
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,840
migration pattern there's a clad and

36
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,919
that's a group of organisms believed to

37
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,118
have evolved from a common ancestor

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,439
according to the principles of

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,438
cladistics meaning all the individuals

40
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,798
here can be traced back to one

41
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,959
common ancestor amongst all

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,560
so early human migration pattern you

43
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,279
could see kind of this out of africa

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,040
model where

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,478
we're looking at the oldest kind of

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,520
components here about 200

47
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,200
000 years ago in the red and kind of the

48
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,359
arrows pointing to the potential

49
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
migration of those individuals

50
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,640
now you can see that they migrated

51
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,839
pretty much north a couple went

52
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,280
to the west this region up here into

53
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,920
kind of what we know is modern-day

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,960
europe and

55
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,159
asia and then over into north america as

56
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,839
well as australia

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,520
what's kind of interesting to note is

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,600
that if you look at the numbers

59
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,959
australia occurred about 50 000 years

60
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,359
ago but new zealand

61
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,879
not far geographically as looking at

62
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,000
mileage-wise

63
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,839
only 1 500 years ago however keep in

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
mind that there is a

65
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,679
not a lot of island jumps to to occur to

66
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
get to new zealand

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,039
so this is the reason why while they're

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,680
not separated very far if you were to

69
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,318
measure them

70
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,680
on a map like this there's this large

71
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,799
separation

72
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,080
in time because of the isolation of new

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,080
zealand compared to that

74
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,000
of australia now the last stages of

75
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,920
hominid evolution modern humans first

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
appeared in africa about 600 000 years

77
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,000
ago

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
three human species were thought to have

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,840
evolved we're going to talk about these

80
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,680
in a little bit more detail and there's

81
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,439
a link here and some

82
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879
images here of the different skull

83
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,519
structures

84
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,719
so the first one here homo halide

85
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,959
burgensis

86
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,719
evolved from africa about 600 000 years

87
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,280
ago migrated to europe from

88
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,598
western asia it was the first early

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,919
human species to live in colder climates

90
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,839
their short wide bodies were likely

91
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,759
adapted for conserving heat

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,598
they had a reduced surface area to

93
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,280
volume ratio

94
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,039
lived in the oldest times to define

95
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,000
controlled uh of fire

96
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,679
and use of wooden spears is also the

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
first early human species

98
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,040
to routinely hunt large animals so

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,959
there's some defining characteristics

100
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,560
this early human also broke new ground

101
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,439
and was the first species to build

102
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,280
shelters

103
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,439
create simple dwellings out of wood and

104
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,360
rock so first had to establish

105
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,359
a house or a living structure

106
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,519
looking here at homo erectus lived about

107
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,959
1.6 million years ago

108
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,719
oldest known early humans to have

109
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
possessed modern human

110
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,759
like body proportions with relatively

111
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,679
elongated legs

112
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,798
and shorter arms compared to the size of

113
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,159
the torso

114
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,319
this means that they kind of lost the

115
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,759
earlier tree climbing adaptations

116
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,919
with the ability to walk and possibly

117
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,479
run long distances giving them the

118
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,119
ability

119
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,919
or more suited for long distance travel

120
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,920
along

121
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,559
land versus being able to more

122
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,000
efficiently climb trees

123
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,598
the homo neander fell lenses appeared in

124
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,199
europe about 130

125
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,438
000 years ago just as the homo helle del

126
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,878
burgensis was becoming rarer

127
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,359
they likely branched off the ancestral

128
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,399
line leading to modern humans

129
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,760
dna has been recovered from these in

130
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,399
more than a dozen

131
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,279
neanderthal fossils from europe and also

132
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,519
asia

133
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,559
their brains are just as large as ours

134
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,079
and there's evidence that they

135
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,199
deliberately buried their dead which is

136
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,120
an interesting note

137
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,720
another species had ever practiced this

138
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,959
sophisticated behavior before

139
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,800
and they abruptly disappeared about 34

140
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,959
000 years ago

141
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,879
now homo sapiens uh the wise men evolved

142
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,399
from africa again about 130

143
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,399
000 years ago and they migrated to

144
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,519
europe and asia and then ultimately

145
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,719
north america

146
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,799
this is called the recently out of

147
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,479
africa model and this

148
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,400
model supported by a variety of gene

149
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,519
studies looking at mitochondrial dna

150
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,679
xy chromosomes and also autosomes

151
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,599
we as humans are unique animals and the

152
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,720
product of evolution our evolution has

153
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,120
been marked by

154
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,160
a progressive increase in brain size

155
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,160
being able to

156
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,759
have refined and accepted conceptual

157
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,039
thought symbolic language

158
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,240
and cultural evolution as well now we're

159
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,680
looking at major evolutionary

160
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,199
transitions we're seeing

161
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,160
kind of this uh progression over time

162
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,840
we've got the

163
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,439
cells the human evolution into brains

164
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,879
we're also now kind of going into the

165
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,519
digital and potential

166
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,120
biodigital fusion of what we're looking

167
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,918
at kind of that

168
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,879
independent kind of technology being

169
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,879
able to kind of

170
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,918
work on its own almost behave like a

171
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,918
brain

172
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,120
so we're getting into where are we going

173
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,959
from here

174
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,639
now looking at evolution in general kind

175
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,638
of fun math for consideration

176
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,639
if the human generation time is about 25

177
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,478
years that means over 100 years there'll

178
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,840
be about four generations as we try to

179
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:46,000
show in the picture here

180
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,000
uh e coli generation time for comparison

181
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,759
only takes about 20 minutes

182
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,160
uh so that means e coli can have

183
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,319
essentially 72 generations in a single

184
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,319
24-hour period humans divert from

185
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,360
chimpanzees estimated to be about 7

186
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,520
million years ago

187
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
which equates to about 280 000

188
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,560
generations

189
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,160
now for e coli to go through that same

190
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,439
time period it only take

191
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,400
about 800 almost 900 days

192
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,879
or a little over 10 and a half years uh

193
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,239
it's

194
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,918
been known that e coli has been a

195
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,759
significant public health problem

196
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:20,318
since 1982 or 32 or so

197
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,800
years ago so this is kind of interesting

198
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,120
how

199
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,038
the rates of evolution may change or be

200
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,639
altered we're looking at cockroaches and

201
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,240
sea lampreys have really not changed

202
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,519
much in the last

203
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,120
300 million years so this kind of brings

204
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,758
apart the question here i'm going to end

205
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,360
it with

206
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,439
how do you think you got here where do

207
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
you think you come came from

208
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,120
just some fun thoughts for consideration

209
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,000
when you're talking about the subject of

210
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
evolution

211
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,879
how did we get here and where are we

212
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,880
going
