1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:06,299
we wrote a brief overview of human genes

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,950
now they kind of interrelate and some

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,660
things that can suddenly go wrong and

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,199
what affects them it we may see from

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,059
that so human chromosomes were looking

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,570
at the somatic cells of 23 pairs of

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:21,299
chromosomes 22 pairs are autosomes and

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,060
one pair is sex chromosomes remember two

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,240
x's is free male and an excellent why is

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:29,820
male so looking here we've our 22 pairs

11
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,538
of autosomes and our one six pair of

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,780
chromosomes

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:38,010
both of these being X indicating this is

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,960
from a female so pleiotropic effects

15
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,670
some alleles can have different effects

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,700
depending on what source parent

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,250
deletions in chromosome 15 particularly

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,950
result in these two potential types of

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,049
syndromes one if it's inherited from the

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,829
father and one if it's inherited from

21
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:58,108
the mother so both kind of are negatives

22
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,739
there's no real positive from either but

23
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,189
depending on what effects who might see

24
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:06,810
determines what parent that particular

25
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:08,459
mutation was inherited from so

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,760
intellectual impairment behavior

27
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:15,030
problems distinctive facial features

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,189
here the hands triangular shape to the

29
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,540
mouth small hands and feet indicated

30
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,649
that it was inherited from the father

31
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,200
Angelman syndrome is inherit from the

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,609
mother this also the same intellectual

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,100
ten problems potential speech

34
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:34,200
impairments seizures or common physical

35
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,828
features can occur and this occurs when

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,060
it's inherited from the mother so

37
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:41,389
depending on what parent it comes from

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,219
in some cases can determine the outcome

39
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:49,200
that is experienced by that offspring

40
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:50,819
like mitotic nondisjunction this is a

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,759
failure for chromosomes to separate

42
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,188
correctly during meiosis one or two is

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,640
termed non disjunction this leads to an

44
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:00,688
AB abnormal number of chromosomes so

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,250
here's how it should be though

46
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,989
everything lines up on the plate the

47
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,989
metaphase plate perfectly separates

48
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:09,449
proper disjunction breaks apart no

49
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,878
problem here we're noticing instead of

50
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,649
separating out like these blue and green

51
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,509
ones did well to our being

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,459
pulled over here during anaphase this

53
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:21,298
would be nondisjunction this would cause

54
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:24,269
all sorts of problems an example of this

55
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:28,379
could be Down syndrome humans with one

56
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:30,959
less autosome are called mono cymatics

57
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:34,500
and these do not survive development so

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,150
if this does occur they really can't get

59
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,400
passed on because that individuals

60
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,430
simply not survive however if there's an

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,289
extra autosome it's called tri-set

62
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,750
Ceramics this is the vast majority of

63
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:48,000
these don't survive try something for a

64
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,239
few chromosomes is capable with survival

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,549
have a severe develop developmental

66
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,908
defects and Down syndrome someone an

67
00:02:53,549 --> 00:03:00,780
example of that trisomy 21 could see

68
00:02:56,908 --> 00:03:02,578
here if the ex-wife if it was a male xx

69
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,489
if is a female the key part here

70
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:08,849
highlight in red is that there are three

71
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,889
under number 21 and a chromosome 21 it

72
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:13,259
should only be two for each and this is

73
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:16,319
a indicative of Down syndrome the

74
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,149
karyotype for Down syndrome probably

75
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,119
have seen or know potentially someone

76
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,969
who's affected with this particular

77
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,449
issue and it's because of the three

78
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:28,949
copies of chromosome 21 that occurs then

79
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:33,060
the disjunction involving sex

80
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:36,930
chromosomes this can lead to sterility

81
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,709
and since we're females a triple x or a

82
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:43,069
female just has one X Turner syndrome

83
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:45,989
non-viable the Owen and X meaning a male

84
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:48,208
can't just have a Y needs an x and a y

85
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,939
because Y only has about 15 or so genes

86
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:54,060
while the x is much more important to

87
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:58,259
get about there's over 2,000 genes on

88
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,519
that males with two x and a y that's

89
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,030
another type of syndrome there that can

90
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,769
occur this occurs because these the non

91
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,680
destruction involving particularly the

92
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,900
sex chromosomes the X and the y is their

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,939
separating out properly or they're not

94
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,030
separate now it could deal the double y

95
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:18,598
gameit's again that's that envelopes

96
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,848
mately XY y zygotes frequency of XY y is

97
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:23,908
one in 1,000 males in general these are

98
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:27,120
typically phenotypically normal because

99
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:30,180
the Y contains so few genes

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,519
can excreting so this is something

101
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,900
that's available to parents a newborn

102
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:38,399
inference can be screened for a number

103
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:40,138
of disorders PKU to make screen an alert

104
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,120
to new parents that treatment may be

105
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,668
necessary for the well-being of their

106
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,680
infant example woman pregnant for the

107
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:48,599
first time at age 35 they want to know

108
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,209
if her baby has down increased odds for

109
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,050
Down syndrome ultrasound as a way of

110
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:56,699
looking at the fetus it's all typically

111
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,710
this black-and-white image so there are

112
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,779
some new ultrasounds coming out that

113
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:03,599
produced more of a 3d like image and

114
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:05,819
then there's also sampling in this case

115
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,470
you see here syringe going and sampling

116
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,089
the amniotic fluid within the womb

117
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,070
they're usually performed during the

118
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:14,279
first month the fourth month of

119
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:15,540
pregnancy and then that was fluid with

120
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,909
and be put into a petri dish and

121
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,550
examined further typically this is done

122
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,810
in conjunction with the ultrasound now

123
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,310
this genetic screening means up some

124
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:28,139
interesting points where if parents know

125
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:32,038
potential issues with their child this

126
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:35,310
could increase the chance for those

127
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,740
parents selecting for or investigating

128
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,569
the chance for an abortion or something

129
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,220
so genetic screening is interesting

130
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:42,779
there's a lot of counseling on that

131
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,210
there's actually majors involved in

132
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:47,279
genetics counseling as one's parents

133
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:49,560
have that information what do they do

134
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,829
with that information and it for the

135
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,589
betterment of them the veteran of the

136
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:56,930
the new unborn child certain things to

137
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,689
consider

138
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,978
so carrier recognition identity

139
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:04,649
identification of heterozygote state for

140
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:06,449
a given trait on this can be evident

141
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:08,638
with a parent knows that they're a

142
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,199
carrier they know they may know that

143
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,660
they had increased odds of you that to

144
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,579
their offspring blood tests are way than

145
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,560
be detected for this an expressive

146
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:20,240
recessive genes to know if their

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,780
particular offspring they did unlucky

148
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,220
carrying on or having one of those genes

149
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,638
that they might be a carrier for

150
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,560
expressed in that individual

151
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,850
lastly the human gene therapy genetic

152
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,879
engineering has potential to replace

153
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,590
defective genes defective cells in being

154
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,240
tested with genetically engineered

155
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:40,769
viruses containing a functional genes

156
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,620
way to replace that gene

157
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:46,288
on a patient's cells can be directly

158
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,329
injected with correct DNA this occurs

159
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:50,219
early on through the process of

160
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:53,490
replication that dreams can be corrected

161
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,190
this so gets into the idea of ethics and

162
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:00,449
should it be done how soon should they

163
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:02,550
find out and this is important aspect

164
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,680
because there is that gene counseling

165
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,389
that's occurring and that is important

166
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,829
thing to keep in mind when you're

167
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:09,569
looking at if you're collecting this

168
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,889
