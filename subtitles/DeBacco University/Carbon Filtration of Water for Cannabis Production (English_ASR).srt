1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,359
if you're looking at implementing a

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,879
carbon filter for your water

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,278
purification needs

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,320
in a cannabis production this debacle

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:09,759
university video

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,320
will give you some details and

7
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:17,920
information about what that filter does

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,920
well what that filter does not do well

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,439
all right let's look at carbon

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,799
filtration of water for cannabis

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,640
production

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,560
well first off a two-stage carbon

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,399
filtration here

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,399
carbon filtration can reduce or remove

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,320
chemicals and heavy metals

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,399
using a two-stage carbon filtration

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,840
system we'll commonly use a coconut

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,280
shell granular activated

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,440
carbon filter typically abbreviated gac

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,359
and that coconut shell is calculated

21
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,359
granular with activated carbon we can

22
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,558
see here a very high capacity

23
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,799
to remove contaminants this two-stage

24
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,079
two-step method removes the widest

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,159
variety of chemicals

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,439
and other heavy metals offering the

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,358
grower the greatest amount of filtration

28
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,640
of that water before it gets to the

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,400
plants

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,840
however it's important to understand

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,478
what carbon filters do

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,719
and do not remove so carbon filters are

33
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,799
effective at removing chlorine

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,478
volatile organic compounds typically

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,759
abbreviated vocs

36
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,478
sediments as well as odor however they

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
are not

38
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,079
very effective at removing minerals like

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,640
magnesium

40
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,798
and iron so keep this in mind that your

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,680
first step of any quality filtration

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,840
process

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,479
is to identify what items or what

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,640
materials you're seeking to remove

45
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,478
once that is identified then you can go

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
back and find out what best

47
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,478
filter would be utilized to remove those

48
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,158
particular contaminants

49
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,840
now the reason why we're looking at this

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,200
kind of carbon filtration here

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,359
what it looks like that's why they're

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,759
typically in this shape is the water

53
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,640
comes

54
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,239
in to the outside and it goes passes its

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,879
way through that filter as it gets to

56
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,078
the middle

57
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,078
when it gets to the middle then it will

58
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,798
go up through and then out to the plants

59
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,718
there

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,799
again effective chlorine taste odors

61
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,359
organics very effective at that

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,439
not so effective at magnesium and iron a

63
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,199
couple other things as well

64
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,199
now filter combinations so carbon

65
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,039
filters are utilized in a lot of

66
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,719
different other filtration methods

67
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,560
sediment and carbon filter combination

68
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,759
here because the goals provide the best

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,598
of both worlds

70
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,759
also the sediment pre-filter can help

71
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,598
extend the life of a carbon filter

72
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,280
which is why they are commonly found

73
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,719
together so even though the carbon

74
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,120
filter might be taking a lot of things

75
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,800
out

76
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,039
as we saw earlier with that very fine

77
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,920
particulate and if there's sediment

78
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,639
in the water system it can clog this

79
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,318
filter up

80
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,479
quite readily so having a sediment

81
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,919
filter will ensure clean water

82
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,919
clean in a sense it does not have

83
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,559
sediment in it will pass to the carbon

84
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,919
allowing the carbon filter to be able to

85
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,000
work more effectively

86
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,199
at removing some of those compounds that

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,360
i mentioned here

88
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,799
and extending its life due to its high

89
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,879
surface area

90
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
so it's often seen in combination

91
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:00,000
offering the grower

92
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,000
the benefit of both worlds
