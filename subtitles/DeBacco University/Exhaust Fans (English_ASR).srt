1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,318
okay here we're gonna look specifically

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,270
at exhaust fans so while this is a

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,309
picture here of a greenhouse with

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:10,500
exhaust fans it must be applied to

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,779
smaller grow areas or even grow tents

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,099
this is kind of the extreme case here

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,079
with greenhouses this is what the

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,960
exhaust fans in the large scale will

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,639
look like now the key part is with an

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,439
exhaust fan is this step one it's a very

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,140
important step is to calculate the cubic

12
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,028
air volume of the grow space the goal is

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,160
to then size the fan so that the entire

14
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:30,359
volume of the air can be removed in

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,980
under five minutes

16
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,719
some growers even prefer to vent the

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,369
room about within one minute it's best

18
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,739
if you're not using carbon dioxide

19
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,570
enrichment but that key first step is to

20
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,089
measure the grow space because you want

21
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,579
to make sure that you're matching the

22
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,620
size of your ventilation fan or your

23
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,299
exhaust fan in this case to that volume

24
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,519
you want it too big you don't want it

25
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,878
too small you want to match the size of

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,559
your facility the next comes Steve vegan

27
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,479
placement so placement the fan is

28
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,968
important location is generally favoring

29
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,759
mid to upper room height to help insure

30
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,890
the warmest air is removed so you can

31
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,539
see the setup I have here very towards

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,519
the top there is a carbon filter also

33
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,650
attached at the very top so that's

34
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,199
ensuring that the warmest air is being

35
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,640
removed and exhausted out then running

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,820
ducting to help ensure the system is

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,920
light proof so we can see here the grow

38
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,889
tents is all sealed up and there's a

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,719
slight bend in this here to prevent any

40
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,849
sort of light infiltration from coming

41
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,090
in or any light leaks here from the

42
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:33,179
actual fan connection itself that's also

43
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,469
very important to keep in mind lastly if

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,450
you are using co2 you don't want to

45
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,700
waste your co2 by exhausting it out of

46
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,859
the facility a timer or other interrupt

47
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,409
system may be used if co2 enrichment as

48
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,319
being implemented

49
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:48,600
also being used to reduce co2 waste so

50
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,609
you don't want to have your co2 running

51
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,709
the same time you're exhausting your fan

52
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,590
especially if you've oversized your fan

53
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,509
you could be taking in an exhausting out

54
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,070
this carbon dioxide and essentially

55
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,259
wasting that that you're putting the

56
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,978
time and energy into enriching your

57
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,978
gross space with
