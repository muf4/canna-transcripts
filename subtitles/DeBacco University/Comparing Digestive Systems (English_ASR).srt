1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,259
as the title suggests we'll be comparing

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,330
different digestive systems of different

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,160
animals this shows a little bit of an

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,780
extreme case we're comparing the deer to

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,750
the human but we're also going to be

6
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:14,399
comparing different animals so starting

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,440
off with just this comparison well

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,929
depending on the animals diet can affect

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,580
their digestive system or tract plants

10
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,320
have very complex carbohydrates such as

11
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,349
starch and cellulose which take longer

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,868
to break down here's an example of what

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,250
a Salus molecule looks like and cotton

14
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,018
fibers are a great example of that one

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,570
of the purest natural forms of cellulose

16
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,399
very complex think if you tried to eat a

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,590
cotton ball really wouldn't get much

18
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,570
nutrients out of it takes a long time to

19
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,129
break that cellulose down however

20
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,710
compared to a cotton ball here eat a

21
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:44,939
sugar cube here's a glucose tablet we

22
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,710
would be able to break that down very

23
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:49,378
easily it's the monomer unit of

24
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,939
cellulose so also this is this bunch of

25
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,670
glucose molecules linked together

26
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,859
however this linkage here makes it much

27
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,829
more complex and takes a lot longer to

28
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,238
break down so looking at some animals

29
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,910
here we have ruminants we have our high

30
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,849
gut and our minor monogastric we do fall

31
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:08,489
into the monogastric category here

32
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,379
ruminants cows the goats the sheep in

33
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,179
the deer they all kind of eat or

34
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:13,618
generally the same diet hindgut

35
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,299
fermenters we're going to talk a little

36
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,909
about what specifics are for those

37
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,700
horses and rabbits our prime example in

38
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,799
Madagascar in addition to us pigs cats

39
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,109
and chickens also fall under this

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,270
category so let's start with the

41
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:29,040
permanence we have four cartman so their

42
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:30,868
stomachs are able to break down grass

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,479
the rumen was actually located on the

44
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:36,000
left side of the cow has billions of

45
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,280
microorganisms look house do is they

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,810
form balls of cud that do and do not

47
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,239
complete the to the grass they initially

48
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,850
eat it go through kind of this multiple

49
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,089
chewing step favor look at the mandible

50
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:50,489
of a cow here see a lot of those very

51
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,350
flattened teeth for that kind of

52
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:55,649
massification a kind of breakdown of

53
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,868
these complex cellulose thin that grass

54
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,939
fibers we see some teeth in the front

55
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:03,780
hairs actually there is a gap between

56
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:07,349
the molars and the t90 incisors here at

57
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,390
the front now we're in a little detail

58
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,219
here that for stomach and this is

59
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,169
replying to cows as I showed in that

60
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:16,080
example also go to ruminants

61
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:18,989
the first two stomachs of the rumen in

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,209
the rectal these contained prokaryotes

63
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,300
and protists that are able to digest a

64
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:26,819
sailor's fiber Zusi our intake here or

65
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,830
starting here and of our beginning the

66
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,859
ruminant will actually regurgitate it's

67
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,900
called cut in the form from the reptile

68
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,670
and as it chews it and it will swallow

69
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,810
it into a third stomach because the eyes

70
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:39,299
Mozza

71
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,770
this removes the water so you'll see

72
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,580
cows that go through in the braise in

73
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,380
the morning and then they're kind of

74
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,550
laying down well what they're do is

75
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,469
we're going to regurgitate some of that

76
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,170
food reaching up and sending it back

77
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:51,419
down we call that cut the cut then

78
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,639
passes into the four stomach in the abom

79
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,729
nezam where it's digested by enzymes

80
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,958
produced by the ruminant see here so

81
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:00,719
it's kind of this kind of regurgitating

82
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,620
retuning and re-adding remix and we're

83
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,289
putting in two different types of

84
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,840
stomach helps them break down as you can

85
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:09,689
see this takes a lot of time and also we

86
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,370
have this multiple stages of breakdown

87
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,139
we haven't even entered the small

88
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,830
intestine yet this is why they're able

89
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,449
to break down such complex carbohydrates

90
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,160
put a little bit per second per spective

91
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,530
here we're jesting compared to see

92
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,389
little stomach digestion remembered were

93
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,039
kind of the single stomach providers

94
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,869
proteins fats all entering here with a

95
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,939
hydrochloric acid that should be a

96
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,069
lowercase L pepsin and then our

97
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,439
intestinal enzymes in ruminants we have

98
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,629
microbes feeding but money giving up

99
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,599
then we have some HDL breakdown then we

100
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,949
have the intestinal enzymes so a lot of

101
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,349
methane is produced because you have a

102
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:46,849
lot of microbes feeding very different

103
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,629
than our simple monogastric stomach

104
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:50,849
continuing on with our hind gut

105
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,319
fermenters these have one simple stomach

106
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:54,569
your secret was responsible for

107
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,180
digesting plant fibers it can be very

108
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,549
long we're gonna focus on horses here be

109
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,769
up to four feet long and horses these

110
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,170
animals must grades often the horses

111
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,239
tend to get something called colic which

112
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:09,389
is a major concern for anyone owning or

113
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,280
working with horses colic symptoms you

114
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,738
can see a couple here all indications

115
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,889
that the horse is for whatever reason

116
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,199
not feeling well and if it is colic

117
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,930
this can result of a blockage of the

118
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:26,098
digestive tract can result in abdominal

119
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,850
pain poor diet poor and water can be a

120
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,949
cause of that

121
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,110
because by twisting the bowels we see

122
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:33,870
here where a quick change to pasture

123
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,569
grass all these can increase the odds of

124
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,069
a horse getting cows that blockage and

125
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,170
that is subjective each fiber that makes

126
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,870
it gets stucked in the cecum that can

127
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:46,770
cause a lot of pain peaking of the belly

128
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,740
excessive rolling lying down a lot just

129
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:53,699
simply not eating all these can be signs

130
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,379
of a horse that has color looking at

131
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,569
monogastric sand that's us included

132
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,459
large complex nutrient molecules are

133
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,680
broken down with the use of a simple

134
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:03,149
stomach should be very familiar now we

135
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,490
have our simple stomach with mechanical

136
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:08,849
and chemical digestion and we enter the

137
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,280
small intestine and go on from there now

138
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,550
comparing and contrasting to monogastric

139
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,889
humans and herbivores such as the rabbit

140
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,480
I have a monogastric digestive system

141
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:20,870
however that does not mean that they

142
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,790
have this same digestive system the

143
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:26,100
rabbit have a small intestine and see

144
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,530
come and large to allow more time to

145
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,320
judge as plant material me remember that

146
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:33,179
from the beginning just to go back to

147
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,819
against this comparison of what falls

148
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,009
know what category horses and rabbits

149
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,649
aren't hanging up fermenters they are a

150
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:42,719
special division of monogastric the

151
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:44,849
rumens have these four chambered

152
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,250
stomachs okay so just a little bit to

153
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,020
kind of keep this all on track here so

154
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,439
they're this enlarged cecum here it's

155
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:54,419
allowing for the increased time to help

156
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,969
break down the cellulose fibers they

157
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:00,740
also digest our food twice and this

158
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:03,420
helps them to be able to feed more on

159
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,840
plant-based diet versus ours which is

160
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,449
more than omnivore type diet looking

161
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,310
specifically now at how these look we

162
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,589
have our insectivore compared to our

163
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,800
carnivore so both of these animals are

164
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:17,779
feeding on a little bit more advanced if

165
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,850
you will

166
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,589
species in the sense of they're not made

167
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,430
up entirely of super complex

168
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,189
carbohydrates

169
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,319
insects and carnivores eating will see

170
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:30,870
me as a result you'll notice that their

171
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,649
digestive system is relatively simple

172
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:37,680
and short compared to that of those that

173
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:39,629
are non Romans but herbivores you see

174
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,500
initially that comparison between these

175
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:43,649
two

176
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,569
a much larger and longer digestive

177
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:47,729
system so just to flip back for a second

178
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:51,240
these have much shorter you see there is

179
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,100
a difference between the two here but we

180
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,019
have to seek them here for the carnivore

181
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,120
the insectivorous is very simple and

182
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,000
small comparing both of these though to

183
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,410
the herbivores and see how much longer

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,569
similar diet in both organisms of the

185
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,420
rabbit versus the deer have they have

186
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:07,800
different digestive tracts the stomach

187
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,360
and cecum are very different between

188
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,160
these two liver roommate here for the

189
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,919
deer and no vermin present for the

190
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,260
rabbit roon also is a Nussle spiral loop

191
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,240
as we see here all this just increasing

192
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,389
the time this animals able to break down

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,819
food here's an extreme example from

194
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:26,579
herbivore doe carnivore and we could see

195
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,310
that distinctive difference in length

196
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,740
here between the two these make for a

197
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,180
great comparison questions if I just

198
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,180
gave you a digestive system could you

199
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,240
infer what that animal may eat and

200
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,040
support it with evidence here's kind of

201
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,240
a nice comparison of the four here just

202
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,240
to give you that idea

203
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,550
see then the same kind of images some

204
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,650
couple key points mentioned here things

205
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,790
to look at and consider if you were just

206
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:54,209
given one of these could you identify

207
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:56,780
the animal's diet it's kind of gives you

208
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:59,250
that kind of sketch or that image here

209
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,969
comparison kind of got all the different

210
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,269
animals

211
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:06,090
notice here the sheep in particular has

212
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:08,009
a very long small intestine versus the

213
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:10,199
human is much shorter in the dog

214
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,120
compared to the human and just pause the

215
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,709
video take a look at these if you're

216
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,009
unfamiliar with any of these animals our

217
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:18,239
next slide provide you with the names so

218
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:21,319
it helps you kind of provide that

219
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,850
comparison between everything lastly

220
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,800
comparing Apes to humans we have

221
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,900
relative lines of the stomach and small

222
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,139
intestine the cecum and colon modern

223
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:33,329
humans to the Apes here we noticed a

224
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,370
relative volume of the stomach is fairly

225
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,030
comfortable most all of them the small

226
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,620
intestine

227
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:40,259
well the gorilla is definitely much

228
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,168
shorter and the human issue way up on

229
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,700
top here seek them very similar in the

230
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:47,309
colon notes that the human is much

231
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,230
smaller so it goes human the champion Z

232
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:51,179
the gorillas so on and so forth if you

233
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,970
work your way up maybe I could even kind

234
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,819
of take myself and this guy

235
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,120
using self right here so Justin get an

236
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:02,390
other comparison between Apes and humans

237
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:05,450
offers just a glimpse at the animals

238
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:07,970
diet and could you be able to compare if

239
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,970
you were given some data how different

240
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:14,740
digestive systems may better match an

241
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,740
animal's main diet
