00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,318
in this tobacco university video we're

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,319
going to cover carbon dioxide

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,320
methods of delivery for cannabis

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,679
production we see a couple

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
in this view we'll go over some of the

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,240
advantages and disadvantages of each

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,280
and there'll be more details of each of

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,370
these methods

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,539
here on tobacco university

10
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,539
[Music]

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,800
all right let me go over some methods

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,560
for carboxylic delivery so you can make

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
an informed decision

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,799
so we have rain tubing the advantages

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,359
are it can allow for even distribution

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,558
across

17
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,558
the area and it also makes for

18
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,599
an easy point of injection below the

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,439
leaf canopy

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,960
it's basically tubing that has small

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,280
little pinholes in it

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,120
at equal intervals however the

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
disadvantages of using this system

24
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,878
is that the max tubing length is 100

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
feet and it should be in a loop so the

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,238
total area is

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,840
limited particularly for large growing

28
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,519
operations

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,199
it should also have a fan to help for

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,840
the distribution process because over

31
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:03,439
that long

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,198
area you won't have any accumulation on

33
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,719
extremely oscillating fan

34
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,478
to help ensure that you're getting an

35
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,319
even mixing of that

36
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,679
despite it's being distributed pretty

37
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,118
over a large area

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,960
you want to make sure you're getting a

39
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,478
mixing as well

40
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,000
then there's also passive point

41
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,079
injection so the advantage

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,920
is that this is the simplest setup in

43
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,118
the sense that there's just one little

44
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,519
end of a tubing and that's where your

45
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,438
carbon oxide comes out the disadvantages

46
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,039
it may cause high concentration pockets

47
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,798
to develop in the grow space

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,560
because you're really only having the

49
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,960
distribution of that carbon dioxide at

50
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,680
one

51
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,359
central point then we also have

52
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
injection point behind a fan so this is

53
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,640
like the

54
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,840
next step above the last one simply put

55
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,719
the injection point and put it right

56
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
behind the fan

57
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,959
to help again help that mixing process

58
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,478
advantages it's really easy to set up

59
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,000
most likely you might have a fan in your

60
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,200
growing space already

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
ensures distribution throughout the

62
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,920
growth space that's another advantage

63
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,399
however this may have challenges in

64
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,799
getting an

65
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,920
even distribution in an odd shaped room

66
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,560
or one that's particularly

67
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,240
long so might be good for a very small

68
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,478
potentially grow tent operation

69
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,679
but not necessarily for a larger growing

70
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,159
area

71
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,159
and lastly we have our heat source as a

72
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,079
point of carbon dioxide

73
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,520
so the advantages of using a heat source

74
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,400
is that if you need to heat the space

75
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,480
anyway

76
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,439
want to get some added carbon dioxide to

77
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,199
your area

78
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,439
however the disadvantage if the heater

79
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,919
comes on only at night

80
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,759
for the addition of heat the added

81
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,958
carbon dioxide that it provides your

82
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,120
plants will not really

83
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,800
provide them any benefit because keep in

84
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,599
mind plants can only utilize carbon

85
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,080
dioxide

86
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,000
during the light cycle so when the light

87
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
is lights are on or the sunlight is out

88
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,199
that's when they can use carbon dioxide

89
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,560
they can't utilize it at night

90
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,679
so if you're using this as a heat source

91
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,800
it's only coming out at night when the

92
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
lights are off because you have less

93
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,519
heat in the area

94
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,360
not going to provide you with as much

95
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
benefits as it potentially could
