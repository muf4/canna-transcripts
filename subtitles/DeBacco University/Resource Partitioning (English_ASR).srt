1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,290
okay here we're looking at resource

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,169
partitioning see just an example here of

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,480
a variant here where we have sunny dry

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:11,099
conditions on the left and shady moist

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,750
conditions on the right there's

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,820
different species are going to favor the

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,129
sunny and dry environment versus the

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,649
shady and moist environment so calls

9
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:21,899
research resource of partitioning this

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:24,149
is formally the principle of competitive

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,868
exclusion which states that no two

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,858
species but the same niche can coexist

13
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:30,599
so the principle this competitive

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,260
exclusion we see have an example of that

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,119
here can be restated as no two species

16
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:37,649
can occupy the same niche indefinitely

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,988
so here we have the yellow birds

18
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,750
occupying the ground the trunk of the

19
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,640
tree and the top portion then these red

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,128
birds move in there's competition and

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,989
we've noticed now that the yellow birds

22
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,968
are located at the very top of the tree

23
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:53,159
and also on the ground while the red

24
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,590
birds are occupying the trunk of the

25
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,569
tree it's an example of competitive

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,300
exclusion as part of resource

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,710
partitioning so let's look at specific

28
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,469
at this resource partitioning well this

29
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,909
is when it is overlap two outcomes are

30
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:07,978
possible one is that competitive

31
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,840
exclusion or really this resource

32
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:12,209
partitioning that we're seeing so we

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,530
have a tree here there's different bird

34
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,259
species that will occupy different

35
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,060
portions of the tree so we're going to

36
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,489
be looking at the very top or apical

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,799
meristem of the tree somebody closer to

38
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:26,129
the ground so I'm going to be on the mid

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,189
section towards the ends here the end of

40
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:31,199
the branches and in this case these bird

41
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:33,719
species are going to be located in that

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,629
center portion of the tree all these

43
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,150
Warbler species are warblers they occupy

44
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,158
the same tree but because of resource

45
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,469
partitioning they're occupying different

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,810
specific niches or different specific

47
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,310
areas within the tree you see here with

48
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,049
the lights lighting up on the different

49
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,600
areas these going to be examples of

50
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,579
different niches within the tree which

51
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,228
is the result of resource partitioning a

52
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,449
lot of different species that kind of

53
00:01:55,228 --> 00:02:00,478
coexist without overlapping in a

54
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,780
particular physical space habitat the

55
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,149
actual tree so as we search partitioning

56
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,399
a persistent competition is rare in

57
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,169
natural communities either one species

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,939
drives the other to extinction or

59
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,559
natural selection reduces the

60
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,180
competition between them

61
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,180
so an example of this research

62
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,770
partitioning is we have hawks and owls

63
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,379
hawks and owls they both have the same

64
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,480
prey in this case it's mice so there's a

65
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,099
region of niche overlap that's occurring

66
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,949
between species one we'll just call them

67
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,659
the Hawks and species two the Owls both

68
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,479
overlap and competing for the same mice

69
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:36,090
here however due to researcher

70
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,189
partitioning we have this now separation

71
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,959
we producing this overlap how this

72
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,180
happened well we're still feeding on the

73
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,060
same species here Hawks now you're still

74
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,360
eating mice but the Hawks are hunting by

75
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,159
the day in the Owls at night this is a

76
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,920
way of separating out reducing the

77
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,840
direct competition of both hawks and

78
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:59,458
owls so they're not competing for the

79
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,650
same prey at the same time some Patrick

80
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,810
species occupy the same to you graphical

81
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,900
areas but they avoid competition by

82
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,360
personing resources so here we have two

83
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,400
different whale species and this the

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,950
Patrick species tend to exhibit greater

85
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,090
differences than the allopatric one

86
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,339
which we'll talk about in the next slide

87
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,560
species doe this is a resulting in

88
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,959
character displacement which facilitates

89
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,030
habitat partitioning and thus reduces

90
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,950
competition so what's an example of this

91
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,719
why don't have these pictures here well

92
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,030
we have the killer whales here which

93
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,859
have teeth the reason why they have

94
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,099
teeth is they're actively seeking in the

95
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,380
ocean they're actively seeking seals

96
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,500
here we have a different whale species

97
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:43,049
that has this filtration system they're

98
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,030
both living in the same ocean but these

99
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,370
are going through and straining out a

100
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,370
small little plankton so that they can

101
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,769
feed this is synthetic species they're

102
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,959
occupying the same geographical area for

103
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,939
avoiding competition by feeding on

104
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,920
different food items ones feeding on

105
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,259
very small almost micro organisms here

106
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,449
it happens feeding on large macros and

107
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:05,519
such as the seals as a result when its

108
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,129
teeth and one has a filtration system

109
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,140
that push out and strain out those from

110
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,930
the water this is an example of research

111
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:16,139
partitioning with synthetic sympatric

112
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,728
species in contrast to that with

113
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,978
research partitioning with allopatric

114
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:22,168
species these do not live in the same

115
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,389
geographic area and thus do not compete

116
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:27,359
so we have Costa Rica fishing we have

117
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,848
different fish species and

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,009
Caribbean versus that the Pacific Ocean

119
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:33,360
is the example of allopatric species

120
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,150
because they don't live in the same

121
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,009
geographic area and therefore do not

122
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:40,008
directly compete with one
