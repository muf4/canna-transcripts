1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,250
okay here we investigate adenosine

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,620
triphosphate or ATP I'm going to see

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,660
these three letters used quite a bit so

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,419
I figured I should help describe what

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,730
this molecule actually is provide you

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:16,859
with a basic picture here and against it

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,679
didn't seem triphosphate so you can see

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,420
the adenine and then three phosphate

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,309
groups but let's look at this a little

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,400
more detailed because it is important

11
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,809
for cellular energy so first off

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,239
adenosine triphosphate it's a

13
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:33,089
multi-purpose chemical energy storage

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,679
molecule it's considered powers cell to

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,530
your work and it's considered the energy

16
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,280
currency of the cell looking at here a

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,270
little bit closer

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,000
we have adenine molecule a ribose sugar

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,530
which you might remember from RNA both

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,009
of these carbons are attached to oxygen

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,020
and then three phosphate groups reason

22
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,979
why it's at three phosphate groups

23
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:57,420
talking about ATP adenosine triphosphate

24
00:00:54,979 --> 00:01:00,299
what this shows here is the triphosphate

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,230
with all three of those phosphates if

26
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:03,599
we're talking about adenosine

27
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,390
diphosphate the day there'd only be two

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,409
phosphates and mono phosphate there'd

29
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,060
only be one phosphate molecule so again

30
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,090
there's the image from the title slide

31
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,240
and how do all these molecules differ

32
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,030
well a MP and then Essene mono phosphate

33
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,069
has one phosphate group and as a result

34
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,469
the energy from bonds is a very small

35
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,719
amount and the energy stored is minimal

36
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,969
this is kind of the least energetic of

37
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,250
the molecules we then go up to density

38
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,379
diphosphate where there's two we have

39
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,000
more energy and a greater amount of

40
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,009
energy stored in those chemical bonds

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,950
and last we have adenosine triphosphate

42
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,989
which has substantial amounts energy and

43
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,000
that's the greatest amount stored in its

44
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:48,328
chemical bonds this is why we typically

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,578
refer to ATP being the energy currency

46
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:54,408
in the south is the most energy but

47
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:57,209
realize that ADP and AMD also do exist

48
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:59,368
so talk about this you know bond energy

49
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,859
well the energy is stored in chemical

50
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:03,899
bonds of molecules the chemical bonds

51
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,840
over energy stored and when the bond

52
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,270
breaks their energy is released this is

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,520
why ATP with our three phosphates has

54
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,590
the greatest amount of energy because as

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,810
these high energy bonds only can

56
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,930
these phosphate molecules together you

57
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,330
ever see adenosine diphosphate here so

58
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,219
we need to think about this for is a lot

59
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,870
of electrical charges will the bonding

60
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,300
the phosphate groups to adenine require

61
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,250
considerable amount of energy because

62
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,819
the energy required to kind of compress

63
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,799
a spring together this is the attachment

64
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,089
of phosphate groups and each phosphate

65
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,219
group being another spring that's been

66
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,930
compressed when you break those bonds

67
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:40,318
getting the spring here kind of letting

68
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,810
go

69
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,629
this is energies released when that bond

70
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,579
is broken so again ATP if you have three

71
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:52,500
these buttons together we have that much

72
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:55,230
more potential for energy so the third

73
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,930
phosphate we get adding to ADP would be

74
00:02:55,229 --> 00:03:00,298
ATP same in with am P if we had one

75
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,500
phosphate missing diphosphate and

76
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:04,709
another phosphate group using

77
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,930
triphosphate the phosphorus is eager to

78
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,628
get away the bond is broken great amount

79
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,629
of energy becomes released energy

80
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:14,789
available when ATP loses a phosphate so

81
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:18,268
as we're releasing energy were breaking

82
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:22,019
that bond running from ATP to ADP or ADP

83
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:24,239
to AMD the nanp missing mono phosphate

84
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,280
portion the molecules stays the same

85
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,039
adding a third phosphate group or

86
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,229
phosphorylation adds energy think of it

87
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,449
is used the people were compressing that

88
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:35,548
spring removing the phosphate group

89
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:37,439
which is released through hydrolysis

90
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:41,519
it's like freeing and uncoiling that

91
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,379
spring releasing that energy lastly

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,900
here's the ATP cycle because I want you

93
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:49,439
to realize that it doesn't exist

94
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,539
all the time as a TP the phosphate

95
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,549
available cell has an unlimited supply

96
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,858
of energy so as we're looking at

97
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,579
phosphate groups as we're able to break

98
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:02,609
them down here to form ADP and then

99
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:05,159
attaching a phosphate group ATP again

100
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,230
we're creating and breaking those high

101
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,219
energy bonds which is going to be used

102
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:10,828
by this cell

103
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:15,409
to perform all sorts of necessary tasks

104
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:18,288
so this energy between a DPM a DP is

105
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:21,418
contained in the phosphate high-energy

106
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:23,639
phosphate ester bond when that's broken

107
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,199
energy is released and when we're

108
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,209
attaching that phosphate group we're

109
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,620
creating that potential offer

110
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,620
energy when that is broken
