1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,349
we have been hearing a lot about the

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,960
corona virus from a wide variety of

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:09,509
sources but human provide a scientific

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,330
investigation related to the corona

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,129
virus well where do you get information

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,138
you know it's constantly changing the

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,330
situation as at least those right now

8
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:19,829
oz is a great link to a website that

9
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:21,929
provides you a lot of scientific

10
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,000
articles that maybe a little detailed in

11
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,518
the reading definitely worthwhile and

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,289
are staying up-to-date so a great

13
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:31,699
information center on this novel

14
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,859
coronavirus as the situation develops

15
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:36,689
now key terms that are used so you'll

16
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,820
hear a lot of terms used here or here

17
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,519
love them in the news epidemic pandemic

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,960
and endemic in might things are all

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,530
interchangeable and in fact they're not

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,329
the the epidemic for example refers to

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,549
an increase often sudden in the number

22
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,530
of cases the disease beyond what is

23
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,299
normally expected so as it visually

24
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,160
local of epidemic could be like a region

25
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,858
here showing a lot of signs of disease

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,898
Ebola went through an epidemic pandemic

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,940
is a worldwide spread of disease and

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,618
that's kind of depicted here where you

29
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,308
see it's showing up all over other

30
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:07,590
regions

31
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:09,989
yes localized in certain areas but

32
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,090
overall spread over the world in an

33
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,158
endemic first a constant presence or

34
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,478
prevalence of a disease so here you can

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,210
see it's not necessary a large cluster

36
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,519
which is kind of showing up all over us

37
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:23,489
is kind of nice visual representation of

38
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,978
how these three terms differ in addition

39
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:29,310
we have pathogen sed virulence and

40
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:31,799
mutation so path of pathogenicity and

41
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,170
virulence comparing those two S's offers

42
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,259
a good comparison looking at the ability

43
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,299
for ism to cause disease and virulence

44
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,180
is the relative capacity of a pathogen

45
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,310
to overcome body defenses this is kind

46
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,320
of how virulent is a disease that means

47
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,868
how likely is it to infect you and cause

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,298
a problem notation is simply a change in

49
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:54,000
DNA sequence which leads to a change in

50
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,560
proteins so it brings us to what's a

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
virus that means about the corona virus

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,629
well do we know what a virus is well

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,359
virus isn't infective agent to the

54
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:05,640
consists of nucleic acid molecule in a

55
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,750
protein coat they're very small cannot

56
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,580
be seen as a traditional light

57
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,618
microscope and they multiply within a

58
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,870
living host so we see here the viruses

59
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,680
finding the living host cause the host

60
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,590
to mass

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,620
by itself and then release many more

62
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,030
particles that seem viral DNA is being

63
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,099
injected into a cell and kind of

64
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,438
overrides the cells natural machinery

65
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:27,268
and we say the term viruses with the all

66
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:29,519
genic consist of but they could have

67
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:32,908
very different shapes here as we can see

68
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:36,389
here so viruses is a category but it not

69
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:38,669
there's many subcategories so why are

70
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,049
viruses hard to control well the answers

71
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:42,479
are continually changing and healing

72
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,430
mutating Crona virus have frequent

73
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,408
mutations and recombination events are

74
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,639
constantly going through changes in the

75
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:49,739
hopes that they'll become better fit for

76
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,989
the environment for the virus and we

77
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,239
hope to try to create conditions that

78
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,579
will reduce their fitness pre of studies

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,840
have shown that on SARS has mutated over

80
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:02,819
the 2002-2004 epidemic to better bind to

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,459
cell their receptors this is shows

82
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:07,318
here's a example of a virus going

83
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,180
through a mutation that would cause it

84
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:10,949
to be better fit new environment here

85
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,889
would be less fit for America see the

86
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:16,530
change in genes over time and at letter

87
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,000
C be the most fit a would be one of the

88
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,709
least fits here but again they're

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,109
constantly changing which makes them

90
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,609
difficult to pinpoint and control and

91
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:25,669
again at the bottom of all these slides

92
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:29,579
where I've used them tried to provide

93
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:31,169
examples here of the links of sources

94
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,439
that I've used as well as in the

95
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,909
description there's information as well

96
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:38,098
so national human fear viruses well it's

97
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:41,908
based on history the Spanish flu caused

98
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:43,348
by the h1n1 influenza virus affected 500

99
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:46,078
million people almost a third of the

100
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,918
world population and killed 25 to 50

101
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,159
million people

102
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,469
so again viruses we hear that term and

103
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:56,399
naturally there's a fear because of what

104
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:59,098
history has shown us so let's just take

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,340
the flu for an example here looking at

106
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:05,128
the CDC estimates that between 9 million

107
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,139
and 45 million illnesses Kurds in the

108
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:13,168
flu 140 to 810 hospitalizations and

109
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:15,239
12,000 61 thousand deaths since 2010

110
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,158
sozin back at the last couple of years

111
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,649
it varies a year-to-year we could see a

112
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:22,439
lot more illnesses less hospitalizations

113
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,929
and luckily less deaths the case

114
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,089
fatality rate is 0.05 percent that means

115
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,629
that's the percentage of people that do

116
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:30,750
die

117
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:33,089
from the influenza flu and the ro Valley

118
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,259
which we'll talk about later is 1.3 so

119
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:36,089
just remember these numbers we'll see

120
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,980
how they compare but this is just for

121
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,169
regular influenza a common cold that

122
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,330
typically spreads in the winter time

123
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,629
every year now take a better look at the

124
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:47,879
corona virus so getting to corona virus

125
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:49,050
well there's corona viruses yes and I

126
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,689
put the s here with a question mark

127
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,379
because it's not just one type of virus

128
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:57,719
that's named for a family of viruses

129
00:04:54,379 --> 00:05:00,060
mirrors SARS and now corona virus all

130
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,070
fall into this same category

131
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,480
all three of these originating dots

132
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:06,029
which is kind of interesting

133
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,840
well general similar shapes also they're

134
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:11,849
all in the corona virus category now the

135
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,439
corona virus itself is kind of zoomed in

136
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,540
look it's named for the crown like

137
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,699
spikes on the surface and a group of

138
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,830
viruses that cause a significant

139
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,199
percentage of all common colds and human

140
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:23,849
adult's and children around the world so

141
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,459
again this is a classification of corona

142
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,020
viruses this is a general family and

143
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,909
they are known to cause diseases in

144
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,069
humans I provided with some of these

145
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,830
specific names here and as well as the

146
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,620
links at the bottom of the page now what

147
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:39,529
is known about the corona virus at least

148
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,680
currently well looking at the current

149
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:43,469
burgeoning

150
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,629
along china human human transmission is

151
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,700
typically via droplets or direct contact

152
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:50,219
and the incubation period can be as long

153
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,800
as 24 days with the immediate incubation

154
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,040
bearing about six point four days

155
00:05:51,800 --> 00:06:00,509
ranging from 2.1 11.1 days two point

156
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,280
five is to 72 97.5 percentile what does

157
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,079
that mean well if we take things that's

158
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,959
here we're looking at the vast majority

159
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:10,169
of cases here this area represented here

160
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:13,949
and here would be that 2.1 to 11.1 days

161
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:16,050
24 days seems to be kind of the longest

162
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,899
chance and that's based on the sources

163
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,180
provided here at the bottom but to put

164
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:24,269
111 point is typical incubation period

165
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,590
being as long as at least one case 24

166
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:30,930
days epidemiology so we're looking at

167
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:34,169
here it is occurring as it's highly

168
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,139
contagious with within about two hours

169
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,640
survival time within the air all age

170
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,099
groups are cysts I've told to the virus

171
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,550
the very young to the very old elder

172
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,439
patient

173
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,210
with two chronic conditions at the same

174
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,219
time are more likely to experience

175
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:49,169
severe illness this is just common that

176
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,510
if an immune systems already compromised

177
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:54,090
are already bailed in one disease I

178
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:56,339
think it's infected with another is more

179
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:58,529
likely to cause death or more serious

180
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,109
effects because of the multiplication

181
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:02,639
here we could see just another example

182
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,920
here it's not just for coronavirus

183
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,269
looking at arthritis in heart disease

184
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:11,220
diabetes in being obese now detailed

185
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:12,930
replication the chromosome necklace got

186
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,120
a ton of time on this which you can see

187
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,189
here's a very detailed sequence of steps

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,750
just even the idea of the complexities

189
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:22,290
of a virus and I lived up buying the

190
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,600
cells transfer their own DNA kind of

191
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,430
invade the cells natural machinery cause

192
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,129
that cell to mass multiply the virus

193
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,170
particles and export those particles to

194
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:33,420
the outside of the cells so they can go

195
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,580
through and check other cells so again

196
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,350
pretty complex process this is why a

197
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,209
viruses can be difficult to control it's

198
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,400
not just as easy is killing them there's

199
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:44,189
really nothing to kill simply because

200
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:46,439
you have that protein coat in DNA

201
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:49,709
they're not living breathing necessarily

202
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:52,439
particles now reproduction number this

203
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:54,689
is the auro factor here looking at

204
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,560
little comparison gene earned by r-not

205
00:07:54,689 --> 00:08:00,959
and it refers to viral transmissibility

206
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,019
so how many people's one person likely

207
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,489
to infect the epidemiology definition of

208
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,500
ro is the average number of people who

209
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,079
will catch a disease from one contagious

210
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,360
person this applies to a population so

211
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,979
if you have an R nought of 2 and you

212
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,170
have the patient zero they look at two

213
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,840
people each of them can then go for it

214
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,220
and in fact about two people SARS has an

215
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,339
iron out of four and you can see how

216
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,670
this one down here can quickly multiply

217
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:28,560
in a much greater rate this is why we

218
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:32,759
take those are not values into

219
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,259
consideration now potential spread or

220
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,090
decline of disease what does these are

221
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,819
not to refer to well if it's less than

222
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,040
one each existing that catches causes

223
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,050
causes less than one new infection if

224
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,579
it's less than one in this case if we

225
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,370
just think about this logically the

226
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,940
disease will decline and eventually be

227
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,320
non-existent if our naught equals one

228
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,750
the disease will stay alive but there

229
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,530
won't be an epidemic I mean one person

230
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,779
will usually pass

231
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,730
to one person where diseases that get a

232
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,860
little bit of concern here is how much

233
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,389
greater is it than one this will cause

234
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,539
the disease to grow exponentially

235
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:08,909
potentially it cause an epidemic or even

236
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:11,459
a pandemic then the higher the number

237
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:13,500
here the more people that can spread you

238
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,420
could see weasels here's 11 to 18

239
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,840
he's one infectious person will likely

240
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:20,429
infect 11 to 18 people

241
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,649
now the ARRA value for the corona virus

242
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:25,559
here from what's currently now in the

243
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,850
calculator are not value of Kona vast is

244
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:29,099
severely greater than one

245
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,259
this isn't it be concerned the

246
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,259
preliminary are not estimate is between

247
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,360
1.4 and 2.5 was presented at the World

248
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,460
Health Organization statement and the

249
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,950
information here on January 23rd year

250
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,379
2020 in information here at the bottom

251
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,850
the case fatality rates about 3% it

252
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,279
means all of all those infected 3

253
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,560
percent typically result in that

254
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,990
fatality in the RNAP value of one point

255
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,250
four to two point five this is all great

256
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,919
numbers but how does this compare to

257
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,889
other diseases so if you look here at

258
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:02,338
the kind of the comparison to diseases

259
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:04,289
over on the side here we see the piece

260
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,970
of fatality rate so this is in

261
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:07,889
percentage so that coronavirus three

262
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,730
percent will die well compared to SARS

263
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:12,179
ten percent

264
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,190
MERS would be 40 percent avian flu forty

265
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:16,588
percent could be some really high values

266
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,600
here we also see some lower values as

267
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,820
well and they are not values entered

268
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,960
Crona one point for potentially as high

269
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,140
as five point five

270
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,830
I could see years here at a less than

271
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,909
one

272
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:32,850
avian flu less than one so these have a

273
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:36,000
very high fatality rate but very low to

274
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,649
transmit so again the corona not they

275
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,339
say the highest to be transmitted and

276
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:42,509
that the highest case fatality rate even

277
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,490
though it's being tucked up in the news

278
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:47,279
and it's spreading like crazy and

279
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,009
killing everyone look at the data here

280
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,439
and put it a little bit in perspective

281
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:54,960
HIV if untreated 80% I'm here without

282
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,030
therapy so again that case would tell

283
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,680
you much much higher so again something

284
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:00,379
to consider here at least put it in

285
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,199
perspective

286
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:06,539
so we're looking at a higher pathogen

287
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,190
destiny trends tends to have lower

288
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:09,269
transmissibility so look at the

289
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,940
influenza virus

290
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:14,220
the pandemic of h1n1 virus caused

291
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,320
relatively mild disease became endemic

292
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,820
in the population the found two

293
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,360
receptors in the upper respiratory tract

294
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:24,209
compared to h7n9 virus have a telomere

295
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,070
actually 40 percent very high and you

296
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,750
can go back and take a look at this and

297
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,220
has so far results of only a few small

298
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,740
clusters of human-to-human transmission

299
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,269
and that specifically bound receptors in

300
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,639
the lower respiratory tract

301
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:38,039
another example is measles virus and the

302
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,649
virus have strong transmissibility but

303
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:42,870
low mortality rate i'm so again kind of

304
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,570
get this trade-off of very high

305
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,159
mortality rate but very low to be

306
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,190
transmitted so it's kind of interesting

307
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:53,100
to see this trend occur again resource

308
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,570
there at the bottom so pathogenicity in

309
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,519
transmissibility of the corona virus

310
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,310
currently seems to have relatively low

311
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,069
pathogen pathogenicity and a moderate

312
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:03,838
transmissibility so here's a comparison

313
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,149
here of some other viruses here you can

314
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,709
pause the slide take a look at that also

315
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:09,600
welcomed and encouraged to look at some

316
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:11,699
of the resources here that I pulled this

317
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,700
information from and it just tries to

318
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:18,690
put it in perspective so just kind of

319
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,950
that reality check here the CDC Centers

320
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,450
for Disease Control's and World Health

321
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,940
Organization are working on addressing

322
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,350
the issue and providing updates your

323
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,899
goal is to inform yourself we'll be

324
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,060
cautious of new sources getting

325
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,350
resources from scientific papers may not

326
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,750
be the easiest it gets away from

327
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,940
opinions and catchy headlines kind of

328
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,649
these white papers are great to get some

329
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,880
data and some information rather than

330
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:40,919
just reading the flashy headline and

331
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,919
jumping to a conclusion and also keep

332
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,419
the situation in perspective have the

333
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,769
example here if someone looks here and

334
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,429
sees number six and someone over here

335
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:51,990
she's the number nine put in perspective

336
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:53,399
h1n1 had a very similar progression and

337
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,070
people are not too afraid of something

338
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,519
that has a potential to cause death

339
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:01,950
which viruses do but again how severe is

340
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,759
this you know what precautions are being

341
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,310
taken

342
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,588
well precautions can you take this isn't

343
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:11,369
something that's very very high

344
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:14,250
mortality rate percentage-wise so

345
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,600
working together as long as transmission

346
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,129
of the virus from one person to another

347
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,019
could be substantially inconsistent

348
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:22,019
interrupted if we could get through

349
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,829
means of isolating people and get that

350
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,720
are valid

351
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,190
are not valuing less than one it's

352
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,320
entirely possible as outbreak could be

353
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,180
controlled or even eradicated going

354
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,060
forward however this requires a joint

355
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:35,789
efforts of the entire society just as an

356
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,439
example polio was very high we could see

357
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:39,179
how those numbers crashed through a

358
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,930
cooperative effort in this has to be a

359
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,309
worldwide cooperative effort

360
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:45,539
lastly the importance is education so

361
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:47,609
educating the communities that

362
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:49,078
strengthen public confidence well this

363
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,269
would be important and that's hopefully

364
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,370
why you're watching this video here did

365
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:55,289
provide yourself with some education

366
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,759
crisis with some resources so you can

367
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:59,759
approach this from more of a scientific

368
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,379
and at a headline format so you can be

369
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:06,169
an important person and

370
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:06,169
inform others with quality information
