1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,560
okay here we're gonna look at some

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,400
nervous system basics and as we see in

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,160
this image

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,990
some of the major nerves are labeled and

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,460
we probably motion with the brain in the

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,980
spinal cord we talked about the nervous

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,500
system there's also some major nerves

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,719
see an ulnar nerve corresponds with the

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,289
ulna which is going back to the skeletal

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,750
system so some of the terms and names

11
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:26,130
interconnect here now as a brainteaser

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,809
since we are talking about the nervous

13
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,178
system I want you to look at this image

14
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:33,000
I want you to try to say the color and

15
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:35,250
not the word so for example the first

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,109
one here the word would be yellow but

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,700
because it's in green color we want to

18
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,519
say the color not the word so this would

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,930
be green this one would be yellow then

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,129
red then black then green and then blue

21
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:48,479
so initially it might be a little

22
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,339
difficult because your right brain is

23
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,558
trying to say the color but your left

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,480
brain is trying to read the word if you

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,030
want something interesting if you have a

26
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,308
young individual you can pause the video

27
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,469
and have them do this and typically they

28
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,839
do it very they do it much better

29
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,820
the younger someone is to ticularly the

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
better they are not really able to read

31
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:09,688
the words they able to recognize the

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,960
colors and they can pick them out and do

33
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:14,399
this at a very fast rate now the

34
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,280
evolutionary path to vertebrate nervous

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,049
system is being the most complex our

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,640
nigerians have simple nervous system

37
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,400
remember those are four examples like

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,439
our jellyfish on this kind of nerve net

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,259
that's going on and then they even

40
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,019
associate activity just have reflexes so

41
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,090
it's a very basic nervous system then

42
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,728
our flatworms are first to kind of

43
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,170
associate the activities and they have

44
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,700
two nerve cords that run down their

45
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,549
bodies and they permit complex

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,240
controlled muscles the more complex the

47
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,450
vertebrates here are more sophisticated

48
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,228
sensory mechanisms differentiate

49
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,640
differentiation into central and

50
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:52,679
peripheral nervous systems as I'll

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,629
discuss in other videos and the

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,750
differentiation of sensory and motor

53
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:00,359
nerves I'll describe here briefly what

54
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,849
this does is this allows reactions to

55
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,640
occur based on stimuli and this

56
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:08,788
elaborative brain activity is reacting

57
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,430
to the environment that the individuals

58
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,829
living in and allowing it to better

59
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,960
control its own system so that

60
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,110
the most efficient in the system is

61
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,400
living so what we're looking at here is

62
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,350
an Astra of controlling and

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,960
communicating systems of the body so we

64
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,609
have sensory input this is where stimuli

65
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,820
is occurring inside and outside the body

66
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,860
and we're kind of receiving that signal

67
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,870
then our brain for examples integrating

68
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,060
that or interpreting that sensory input

69
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,069
it's basically saying okay here's just

70
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,129
an impulse now what does that mean is it

71
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,979
hot is it cold it's at pain what are we

72
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:46,379
looking at and then that's gonna result

73
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,879
in motor output and that's our response

74
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,900
to this day right here we're having the

75
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,370
hand basically go through and curl up

76
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,830
and that's response is denied by

77
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,469
accident activating effector organs and

78
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,630
this is a response here so first about

79
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:03,419
is interpreting that signal that sensory

80
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:05,099
input integrating that making sense of

81
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,739
what's going on and then resulting in a

82
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,689
motor output how that looks here is we

83
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,490
have our sensory key part with the

84
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,680
sensory is we're receiving signals so

85
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,930
for example we have sensors in the skin

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,659
and that sensory system is sending that

87
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,150
information to the brain then the brain

88
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:23,729
here is going through and sending a

89
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,250
signal to a muscle that could cause it

90
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:29,369
to contract so this would be a prime

91
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,919
examples of if the water is hot and the

92
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,239
brain is sensing that hot water it's

93
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,879
interpreting that signal I should move

94
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,439
my hand today I'm going to send a motor

95
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,719
signal here to the muscles that would

96
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,709
contract or pull that hand away from

97
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,389
that area of danger functions of the

98
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,670
nervous system just some two basic ones

99
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:49,859
first is - it's the control center for

100
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,629
all body activities and here's our

101
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,790
central and peripheral nervous system

102
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,889
cell control center for all of our

103
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:57,929
tivities is a great summary of this in

104
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,399
addition the second function of the

105
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,800
nervous system is to respond and

106
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,650
adaptive changes that occur both inside

107
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,950
as well as outside the body this relates

108
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,560
to pain temperature pregnancy any host

109
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:12,599
of things that the body is responding to

110
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,739
so the key part is with our nervous

111
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,449
system its way of not only interpreting

112
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,160
signals that are coming from both inside

113
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,860
and outside of the body but it's also

114
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,010
along the by to react to those changes

115
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,610
to keep it out of potential dangers and

116
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,120
it the best fit for the

117
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,120
lives in
