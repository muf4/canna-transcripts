1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,759
so here i'm going to outline how you

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,359
would dust for latent fingerprints and

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,639
keep in mind latent prints are ones you

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,359
can't initially

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,638
visually see so word of caution when

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,119
you're going through

7
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,879
this process of identifying these kind

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,399
of hidden prints

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,199
is that it can be messy but also a fun

10
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,599
process

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,800
it's a challenge to to clean this very

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,560
fine powder

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,320
because it does need to get into all

14
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,079
those little porous surfaces

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,079
so if you get it in areas you don't want

16
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,598
it it's very hard to clean from those

17
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,839
surfaces you want to keep your working

18
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,759
area small and try to work on paper or

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
tray surface when possible to make

20
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,839
cleanup a lot easier and keep things

21
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,719
organized we don't want it looking like

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,640
the holy

23
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,960
festival of colors when we're working

24
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,960
with these powders

25
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
so dusting and lifting prints from glass

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
or plastic

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
first you want to make the print so to

28
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,519
make a quality thumb print on the glass

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,640
or plastic surface

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,920
you want to rub your thumb usually

31
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,520
against your forehead to help ensure

32
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,719
there's enough oils present

33
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,640
especially if you just recently washed

34
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,600
your hands the goal is to press with

35
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,079
moderate pressure

36
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
in a linear vertical motion on the

37
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,118
actual

38
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,478
surface don't press too hard or roll or

39
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,959
smear your print

40
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,719
because remember you can also clean the

41
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,478
area and try again a lot of students

42
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,840
sometimes try too hard

43
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,280
initially so you just kind of want to

44
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
for example it's the glass just grab it

45
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,439
like you normally would

46
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,919
and odds are you're going to be

47
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,959
transferring just enough there

48
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,560
of oils without ruining the print

49
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,319
then uh for dusting and lifting the

50
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,478
prints on this glass or plastic surface

51
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,719
option one is use magnetic powder and

52
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,078
a brush so pick up it's called a beer of

53
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,719
magnetic dust this is kind of this

54
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,519
little

55
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,280
area here it does look like a beard in

56
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,078
dust while keeping the plunger of the

57
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
brush pushed

58
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,158
down the goal is to have it hang from

59
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,719
the bottom of the brush as we kind of

60
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,118
see

61
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,158
example here and we see the person going

62
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,078
and doing here

63
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,200
you want to gently brush the hanging

64
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,199
dust particles over

65
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,560
the latent print you want to smear the

66
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,399
print when i have too much pressure

67
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,879
just want to just very lightly go over

68
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,640
it because if you have too much force

69
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,759
or use a plastic brush comes in contact

70
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,959
with the print you're going to damage

71
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,078
the actual print

72
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,438
you want to pick up the loose and

73
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,559
excessive dust and put it back in the

74
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,318
original container

75
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
keep in mind it does take very little

76
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,919
dust to accomplish this

77
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,520
option two would be using just regular

78
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,799
dust powder and a brush which is going

79
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
to follow very much

80
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,319
a similar method except here you're

81
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,000
going to dip the brush lightly into

82
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,598
container powder and then tap off the

83
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,598
extra into the lid

84
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,519
you want to use only a very small amount

85
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,359
of powders you need to dust the print

86
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,719
this comes with kind of some experience

87
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
but if you're starting out

88
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,719
use less than you think is will be my

89
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,159
suggestion

90
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,080
you want to lightly swirl the brush over

91
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,639
the print and rotate between your thumb

92
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280
and fingers careful not to smear the

93
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,439
print

94
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,479
lastly the brush to re use the brush to

95
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,159
remove any excess

96
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,238
powder that you may have and hopefully

97
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,680
you'll be able to see the print become

98
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,959
visible

99
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,879
dusting lifting prints from glass or

100
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,000
surface you want to then lift the actual

101
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,799
print so great you've gone through

102
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,479
you've dusted it

103
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,160
you've created a wonderful print here we

104
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,000
see a whole kind of hand print

105
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,519
here we see an identified fingerprint

106
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,959
how do we lift that print how do we get

107
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,319
it off the surface

108
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,239
we want to acquire a piece of tape

109
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,439
that's larger than the print start by

110
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
sticking a portion

111
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,120
near the print and then smooth it over

112
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,640
the rest of the print so you're kind of

113
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,840
causing a fixing in one spot

114
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,079
you're smearing it over that print

115
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,680
and the goal is not to have it shift or

116
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,000
move

117
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,599
smoothing action the smearing over we

118
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,719
want to have it consistent in even

119
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,518
contact

120
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,199
then after it's fixed as we can see here

121
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,360
i want to slowly peel the tape

122
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,238
off the surface and stick it to a clean

123
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,480
flat

124
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,840
piece of paper surface for inspection

125
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,318
it's good to have that ready ahead of

126
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,759
time

127
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,119
so when you immediately lift it off

128
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,479
you're immediately going right to the

129
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,200
your paper on that clean

130
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,679
and flat surface now dusting for

131
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,079
fingerprints

132
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
if you're on paper so just one example

133
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,640
here

134
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,318
touch your thumb or forehead to your

135
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,199
forehead and press it on a piece of

136
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,439
paper

137
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,039
if you don't see the print uh don't

138
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,919
worry because these are latent prints a

139
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,359
lot of students will kind of make the

140
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,719
print on the paper and then try to look

141
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
for and see if they can see it

142
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,919
a lot of times you'll be able to see it

143
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,000
and that's okay these are latent prints

144
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,719
you want to dust and lift

145
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,239
following the same method and procedure

146
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,199
on the previous

147
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,360
kind of example for a glass and plastic

148
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,598
surface the same applies to paper

149
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,040
if you do it correctly you can get a

150
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,759
print that looks very

151
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,798
much like this and this does allow for a

152
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,199
lot of

153
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,159
ability to go through and identify what

154
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,079
type of print it is

155
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
but also see some of the very specific

156
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,079
classifications with that print

157
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,360
to be able to see if you have a match

158
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,599
between two prints

159
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,199
so hopefully this was helpful in going

160
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,759
through and knowing how to dust for

161
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,639
latent

162
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,639
fingerprints
