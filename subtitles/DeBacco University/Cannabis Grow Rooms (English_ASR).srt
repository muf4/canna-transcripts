1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,330
now when looking at cannabis grow rooms

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,460
that can be a highly varied operation

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,179
even though it may be under the same

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,299
term to also see here the plants either

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,519
organize the lighting the venting some

6
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:18,509
of the insulation that's used one of the

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,969
things I would make note of this

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,740
particular grow room would be the amount

9
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,448
of power that's used over here so you

10
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,129
want to be mindful and careful about

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,320
where we're putting all of our power how

12
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:29,399
we're stringing everything together

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,170
wanted to believe have a cleaner and

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,738
neater than this and maybe in an area

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,140
that's in decreased humidity to decrease

16
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,669
the chance of you know having a

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,039
short-circuit or having the potential

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,980
for fire to start so again just because

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,628
you see a grow room maybe only focused

20
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,058
on the plants but also look at some of

21
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,820
the supporting structures and be mindful

22
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:53,009
that every room is not necessarily the

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,579
most efficient or the correct option to

24
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:58,979
go so just grow rooms in general these

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,058
are permanent rooms that are not like a

26
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,799
portable grow tent

27
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,739
even though grow tents are great places

28
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,649
to start to kind of experiment and then

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,118
you can kind of upscale to a grow room

30
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,830
these rooms are typically have pretty

31
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,340
easy access to power because they're

32
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:16,200
typically designed for that it's a good

33
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,820
think of it is one way it's almost like

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,579
a permanent rotate very large

35
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,899
impermanent grow ten by starting with a

36
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,188
grow tent and help minimize some of the

37
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,469
mistakes you'll make in this room

38
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:27,688
because this is a much larger operation

39
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:30,868
with a lot more upfront cost and also

40
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:32,669
reoccurring costs so there's small scale

41
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:35,609
grow rooms I always say kind of define

42
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,780
what small is so some people small is

43
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,188
like a small little grow tent some

44
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,700
people this might be a small operation

45
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:42,959
again your definition of small should be

46
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,299
looking at either square foot or number

47
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,129
of plants in these grow rooms they can

48
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,070
be surrealist media containers or even a

49
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:51,719
hydroponic setups can work efficiently

50
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:53,309
you want to only move plants in that had

51
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,530
time to develop sufficient roots from

52
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,618
the clone and propagation room this is a

53
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,170
veg room in this image here trellising

54
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,578
may be needed as a plant support so be

55
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,040
sure to use clean material that is

56
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,899
either new or each planting for each

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,479
planting or that has been cleaned before

58
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,800
reuse so you can see a couple stakes in

59
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,450
here you don't wanted to keep the stakes

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,590
and you want to clean them before

61
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,179
another

62
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,628
round of plants may come into this

63
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,909
vicinity now large grow rooms there's no

64
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:22,829
set definition of what a large grow room

65
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,930
is typically it's considered usually

66
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,580
about twenty five or greater plants and

67
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,500
it's often not recommended for a

68
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,269
beginner simply because there's just a

69
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,030
lot of expense and knowledge that is

70
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,549
required the dense foliage in a larger

71
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,318
room can reduce air circulation so we

72
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:40,500
see here we see these cam filters and

73
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,000
cam fans it can really help improve air

74
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,459
circulation when you're growing a very

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,590
large scale efficient way to kind of

76
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,539
move some air to prevent some of the

77
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,180
issues that can occur when you increase

78
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:53,039
plant size now for larger grow rooms

79
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,420
typically there's more forms of

80
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,519
automation that come in as it is

81
00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:00,750
automatic watering fertilizer injecting

82
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,280
do humidifying air circulation however

83
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,560
just because you're adding in all these

84
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,180
wonderful systems is automated systems

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,729
this does not mean that the work

86
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,049
decreases if one person is running a

87
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,268
large grow room there's simply not

88
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,909
enough time to perform some of the

89
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,860
tedious tasks for all plants when it's

90
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,889
something might be very possible in a 1

91
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,230
to 4 to 5 plant operation may not work

92
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,700
in a very large grow room so this

93
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:25,738
automation takes care of some of those

94
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,169
daily maintenance tasks but you still

95
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,870
need to be kind of hands-on monitoring

96
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:32,488
trellising pruning and the daily tasks

97
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,500
there that something gets more difficult

98
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,500
as the plant number increases
