1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
ever wonder what causes yelling leaves

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,439
in your cannabis plant

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,480
well this debaco university video will

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,199
provide you with a quick

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,800
visual guide and you can search the

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,320
channel once you have an idea of what

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,200
deficiency your plants might be

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,519
experiencing

9
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,160
to get more detail on that particular

10
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,160
deficiency

11
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:25,359
[Music]

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,198
all right that's going to give you a

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,680
brief overview of what causes yellow

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
leaves

15
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,920
on cannabis so first off there are many

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,039
potential causes i just want you to

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,800
realize that

18
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,640
and while there may be a long list of

19
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,320
potential causes for just yellowing

20
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,558
leaves this will attempt to provide

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,600
some common nutrient related causes for

22
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,199
that yellowing

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,800
the location of the yelling leaves is

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,920
important to try and determine the

25
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,159
likely cause

26
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,520
so you can implement corrective measures

27
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,919
and as i said with all these

28
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,760
search the channel for more detail so

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,520
first off if yelling towards the top of

30
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,320
the plant like these two images show

31
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,920
this is likely an iron deficiency if you

32
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,960
want to know how to correct the iron

33
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,800
deficiency

34
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,960
again these are more videos on all of

35
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,079
these deficiencies here on tobacco

36
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,599
university

37
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,280
a lot of people confuse though this iron

38
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,919
deficiency with nitrogen and that's not

39
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,920
the case

40
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,600
the upper leaves are yellowing both

41
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,000
early and later stages in growth that is

42
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,438
an iron deficiency

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,438
yelling the plant leaves towards the

44
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,199
edge so as we see all these the edge of

45
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,399
the leaves here is what's exhibiting

46
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
that yelling or in

47
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
severe cases browning this is usually a

48
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
characteristic

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,599
of what's a potassium deficiency a

50
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,040
little bit more common

51
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,000
in the lower leaves and a little bit

52
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,400
more common later in the season

53
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,759
then we have the intervenal yellowing

54
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,520
where we're having that kind of

55
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,280
in between the veins we're having that

56
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,519
yellowing that is occurring

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,040
this is more characteristic of a

58
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,519
magnesium deficiency

59
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,320
and also commonly found more so on the

60
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,359
lower

61
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,319
leaves of a plant then we have yelling

62
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,319
of just those

63
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,519
lowering leaves in a solid kind of

64
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,319
coloration of yellow

65
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,280
no real pattern just all of the leave is

66
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,398
kind of turning

67
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,118
yellow this is indicative of a nitrogen

68
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,280
deficiency where the tops remain green

69
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,038
and the bottoms yellow out nitrogen is a

70
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,919
mobile nutrient and it can translocate

71
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,519
through the plant

72
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,439
so the plant is actually stealing it out

73
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
of these older lower leaves and pushing

74
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,639
it towards the upper

75
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
growth of the newer leaves there that's

76
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,559
why the newer leaves remain green

77
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,080
lower leaves remain yellow hopefully

78
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,920
this is a very brief overview

79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
if you see something that looks familiar

80
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:30,479
search the channel so you can correct

81
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,479
that issue in your particular plans
