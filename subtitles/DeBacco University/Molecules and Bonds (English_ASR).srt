1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
okay here we're looking at molecules and

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:08,009
bonds see a couple examples presented

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,230
here and I say the word bonds we're not

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,419
talking about James Bond what I'm

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,280
talking about Barry bond we're not

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,399
talking about me municipal bonds we're

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,350
talking about of course chemical bonds

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,959
so what are chemical bonds bonds with

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,760
incomplete valence shells can share or

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,890
transfer valence electrons with certain

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,230
other atoms forming these chemical bonds

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,910
the formation and function of molecules

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,850
depend on the chemical bonding between

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,439
atoms two main classifications are going

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,929
to be covalent bonds where we see these

16
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,869
electrons being shared in ionic bonds

17
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:42,600
where electrons are being transferred so

18
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:45,929
start with ionic bonds atoms sometimes

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,230
take electrons from their bonding

20
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:50,820
partners as we see in this animation an

21
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:54,179
examples of transfer an electron from a

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,369
sodium to chlorine see here sodium being

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,049
transferred over both atoms have charges

24
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:00,419
and that charged atom or molecules

25
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:03,179
called an ion see a positive and a

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,939
negative here being drawn together now

27
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:09,719
these ions remember we call a positively

28
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:13,739
charged ion a cation and a negatively

29
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:16,560
charged ion in an ion and as a result an

30
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,899
ionic bond is an attraction between an

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,350
anion and a cation attraction between a

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,549
positive and a negative ion here and

33
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,559
that's occurring because we're moving

34
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,900
electrons so keep in mind remember

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,939
electrons have a negative charge and we

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,950
transfer them we're also moving down in

37
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:35,158
the electron but the charge and a

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,868
negative charge at that so we see that

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,118
depicted here compounds formed by ionic

40
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:40,920
bonds are called ionic compounds or

41
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,509
salts probably one were most familiar

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,269
with here is sodium chloride which is

43
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,759
table salt and often found in nature as

44
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,349
crystals and as result of a metal and a

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,228
nonmetal combined metal and a nonmetal

46
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,169
light so we see here sodium losing that

47
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,519
electron creating a positive charge

48
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,868
chlorine here gaining electrons getting

49
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,618
that negative charge and that positive

50
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,780
negative

51
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,478
forming this bond that's forming called

52
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,790
an ionic bond now what that actually

53
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:08,459
looks like is ionic substances tend to

54
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,409
form crystalline lattices rather than

55
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,180
distinctive molecules so we've ever

56
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,829
looked really really closely at salt

57
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,719
you'll actually see

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,760
these little what looks like like boxes

59
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,370
or cubes that occur this is a crystal

60
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,159
lattice it's because our sodium and our

61
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,689
chlorides fit very neatly together if we

62
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,419
go back and look at previous lectures we

63
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:30,210
see what happens to the atomic radius of

64
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,549
cations and anions and it helps you

65
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,520
understand why these fits so neatly

66
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,469
together the other formula mentioned was

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,180
called covalent bonds is that the

68
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:41,819
sharing of a pair of ions electrons by

69
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,980
two atoms in a covalent bond the shared

70
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,900
electrons count as part of each out of

71
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,090
his valence shell they're being shared

72
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,340
not transferred shared so it can count

73
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,640
in both of these particular hydrogen

74
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,450
atoms how does that look when we look at

75
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,969
our molecules now so a molecule consists

76
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:03,239
of two or more atoms held together by a

77
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:05,580
covalent bond a single covalent bond or

78
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,230
Silla bond is the sharing of one pair of

79
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,270
valence electrons remember this line

80
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,699
there's own luxury represented here in

81
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,230
here it's kind of connect them together

82
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:14,789
in a double Cavill under a double bond

83
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:17,039
is a sharing of two pairs of valence

84
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:19,049
electrons as we see here between these

85
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,669
two carbons it's double bond between

86
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,420
this carbon is hydrogen we have a single

87
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:26,488
bond that's forming now structural

88
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,409
versus molecular formula the notation

89
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,420
used to represent atoms and bonding

90
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,489
that's called the structural formula the

91
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,889
structural formula that's represented

92
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,230
here it depicts the structure how those

93
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,179
atoms are organized pretty simple as

94
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:40,679
line two hydrogen's this can be

95
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,170
abbreviated further to the what we call

96
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,599
the molecular formula an example here

97
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,669
just a ch2 so here we also see an

98
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,919
example of the structural formula and

99
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,049
then down here we see the molecular

100
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,768
formula all these are representing the

101
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,870
same thing

102
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,849
here is the big black circle here's

103
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,819
carbon with four hydrogen's here's our

104
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:02,419
two oxygens and two oxygens forming

105
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,739
carbon dioxide and two water molecules

106
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:07,530
so we could say they're essentially

107
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:11,430
telling the same story with depicting it

108
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,080
in different ways compound is a

109
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,120
combination of two or more different

110
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,069
elements so covalent bonds can form

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,798
between atoms of the same element or

112
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:21,750
atoms of different elements we see that

113
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,478
located here with our carbon planet or

114
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,370
hydrogen carbon bond to other carbons

115
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,810
these we will assume are hydrogen's

116
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,430
this gets very important

117
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,069
we start looking at structure in shape

118
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,660
in macromolecules since it's kind of

119
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:37,019
just that understanding of what's going

120
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,880
on at the molecular level here so these

121
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:40,859
compounds so compound is a substance

122
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,870
consisting of two or more elements in a

123
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,240
fixed ratio it comes out as

124
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,730
characteristics different from those of

125
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,040
its elements so we have carbon and

126
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,660
hydrogen carbon has its properties iron

127
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,780
has its properties when we combine them

128
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,000
we may get different properties it's

129
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,799
probably most obvious here with sodium

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,019
chloride that we're also sodium clear

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,910
that we're also familiar with sodium

132
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:06,449
itself is actually this kind of gray

133
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,070
looking shiny metal chlorine in this

134
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:09,990
case the chlorine gas is extremely

135
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,449
deadly and has this yellowish almost

136
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,129
greenish like look to that and when we

137
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:17,759
combine these two together we get sodium

138
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:20,129
chloride table salt dhruv all had we all

139
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,439
have inside that's very important so

140
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:23,939
sodium looks very different in chlorine

141
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,410
looks very different than sodium

142
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:28,168
chloride so this is an example of how

143
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:31,590
combining these atoms together confirm

144
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:34,349
it very different properties essential

145
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:36,509
elements for life about 25 of the 92

146
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,689
elements are essential for life carbon

147
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:42,120
hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen make up 96%

148
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:44,160
of living matter most of the remaining

149
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,889
4% consists of calcium phosphorus

150
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,720
potassium sulfur what's left those what

151
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,849
we call trace elements those are

152
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,700
required by an organism in very small

153
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,189
quantities we see here an example of

154
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,620
some trace elements so magnesium would

155
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:02,160
be an example of an element even very

156
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,600
small percentage traces less than 1%

157
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,070
magnesium can not fall into that

158
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,810
category but zinc selenium iron iodine

159
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:12,779
chromium boron these are all trace

160
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:17,339
elements essential for life but still

161
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:19,529
needed in very small amounts we have

162
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:22,079
certain things called non polar covalent

163
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:24,538
bonds so covalent lands is sharing but

164
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,240
non polar means atoms are shared share

165
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:29,099
the electron equally we see that here

166
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,500
like think of tugga we're on tug-of-war

167
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,419
and everyone's pulling equally no real

168
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,160
favoritism here everything is being

169
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:38,490
shared equally it'd be a non polar

170
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,930
covalent bond in contrast to that they

171
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,650
have a polar covalent bond where the

172
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,449
atoms do not share them equally

173
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:45,069
here we have the same tug of war example

174
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,290
we're getting pulled in one direction

175
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,540
one Adam it was called more

176
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,240
electronegative that means it came as a

177
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,910
stronger affinity stronger ability to

178
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,918
pull electrons towards it this results

179
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,199
in an unequal sharing of electrons

180
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:01,120
this will cause we call partially

181
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,300
positive and partially negative charged

182
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,180
each molecule so we see here our big

183
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,910
oxygen pulling in the electrons cream

184
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,009
these weak negative charges resulting in

185
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,449
these weak positive charges because

186
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,720
these electrons are being pulled closer

187
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:19,360
to it this molecule here of oxygen takes

188
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,400
on a slightly negative charges here as a

189
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,560
result this area here there's electrons

190
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,989
are pulled away from it protons here

191
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,360
have a slightly weakly positive charge

192
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,960
here very important for the properties

193
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,879
of water continuing on this concept of

194
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:35,680
electronegativity to the atoms

195
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,689
attraction for the electrons of a

196
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,819
covalent bond the more electronegative

197
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:42,759
an atom the more strongly it pulls

198
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:46,209
shared electrons towards itself the most

199
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,759
electronegative atom here is fluorine in

200
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:50,739
the least is francium so you see this

201
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,300
general trend is you work our way up and

202
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,418
to the right the greater

203
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,639
electronegativity atoms are located here

204
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:59,740
and these are weaker so it kind of gives

205
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,220
you an idea of the trend within the

206
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,930
periodic table now what's called a

207
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,419
dipole is polar bond between atoms

208
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,519
produces a polar molecule or Polar's

209
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:11,680
unequal sharing which has areas with

210
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,779
slightly positive or slightly negative

211
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,728
charges we see that here here's our

212
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:17,859
oxygen slightly negative or slightly

213
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,750
positive charges here this creates a

214
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,610
dipole where there is a concentrated

215
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,810
positive charge separated from a

216
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,460
concentrated negative charge hydrogen

217
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,689
bonds a hydrogen bond forms when

218
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:33,309
hydrogen atoms covalently bond to one

219
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,950
electronegative atom is also attracted

220
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:37,899
to another electro negative atom in

221
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:41,080
living cells also true native patterns

222
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,668
are usually oxygen or nitrogen atoms the

223
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,250
hydrogen bonding that joins water

224
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:47,289
molecules are weak so only about 120 it

225
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,778
around as a covalent bond so while they

226
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:51,219
are bonds they're very weak bonds let me

227
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:53,070
see that represent these lines here we

228
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:57,149
have a weak negative a weak plug

229
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:59,129
positive as a result our hydrogens are

230
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,198
going to have this bond forms we call

231
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:03,328
hydrogen bond we represent with the

232
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:04,889
lines it's pretty easily broken but it

233
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:07,859
does kind of stick together

234
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:09,839
or a little bit so we have something

235
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,909
called Vander Waals interactions if

236
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,680
electrons are distributed asymmetry in a

237
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:15,059
molecule or atoms this can result in

238
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,609
hotspots of positive and negative

239
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:19,559
charges these Vander Waals interactions

240
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,930
are interactions between molecules that

241
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,869
are close together as a result of these

242
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:27,388
charges and geckos kind of use this as

243
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,068
their ability to stick to walls and

244
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:31,980
ceilings because of these particular

245
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,899
interactions that occur so you see a

246
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,389
little close up here collectively

247
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,730
such interactions can be strong because

248
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,350
there's a lot of surface area a lot of

249
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,230
opportunities for these Vander Waal

250
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,509
interactions to occur and this is

251
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,879
because of the toe hairs this is what

252
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:50,250
allows geckos to clean or kind of stick

253
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,639
to wall or ceiling surfaces allowing

254
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,019
them to run out of that area

255
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,669
dipole-dipole interactions these are

256
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,039
partial positive and negative charges

257
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:00,778
molecules point themselves with positive

258
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,909
being attracted to negative charges we

259
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,980
see here kind of like think about almost

260
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:08,519
like a magnet and this occurs in

261
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,300
hydrogen bonding also occurs in ions it

262
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:14,789
can be induced and also hydrogen bonding

263
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:16,198
lastly we chemical bonds most of the

264
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:19,318
strongest bonds and organism are

265
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:22,019
covalent bonds ionic bonds are had the

266
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:24,479
strongest bond energy we see our way or

267
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,009
working down the line up here weak

268
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,720
chemical bonds such as hydrogen bonds

269
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:30,088
and Vander Waals are also important

270
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,278
because they reinforce shapes and adhere

271
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,540
molecules together so while these are a

272
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,028
weaker bonds something that they're

273
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,679
necessarily less important they're very

274
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:39,958
important when we start thinking about

275
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,638
protein folding which is important for

276
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,859
enzymes which is important for our

277
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,568
structure determining the function the

278
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,789
way a protein folds will impact its

279
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:49,889
function the way it folds may be

280
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:51,149
dependent on hydrogen bonds even though

281
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:54,480
they're weaker than ionic and covalent

282
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,860
they still are very important hopefully

283
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,360
that was a nice Journal quick overview

284
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,360
of molecules and bonds
