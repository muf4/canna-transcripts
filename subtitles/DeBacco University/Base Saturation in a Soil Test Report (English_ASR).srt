1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,839
ever get a soil report back and see

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,839
basic saturation listed

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,439
well here on debaco university we're

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:16,640
going to explain a little bit about what

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:18,400
those numbers mean

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,839
all right let's get into base saturation

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,278
in a soil test report

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,198
and here we see there's some sample

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,439
numbers with some ranges given

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,640
but let's get into just what is base

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,079
saturation

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,359
so that's the first question here as

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,159
we're looking at base saturation just

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,160
what is it

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,238
and it's the percentage of the soil's

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,119
cation exchange capacity

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,159
occupied by calcium magnesium and

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,119
potassium

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,878
is referred to as base saturation keep

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,640
in mind though that ph does have an

21
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,878
impact on these levels

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
so we say cation exchange capacity

23
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,159
cation

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,960
keep in mind soil particles are

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,839
typically mostly negatively charged

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,039
cations are positively charged ions we

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,320
see that here with our calcium

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,680
our potassium and our magnesium are all

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,959
examples of positive cations so here

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
we're referring to this

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,000
as the ability to exchange those we

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,400
could see them

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,159
changing as we get uh more towards it

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,560
closer to a neutral ph

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,840
very acidic ph we see there's not a lot

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
of calcium there's not a lot of

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
magnesium

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,920
and potassium held on the soil particle

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,280
positive negative components

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
as we get closer to that neutral we're

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,478
seeing increase in that number of

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,040
cations or positive ions

43
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,719
so we're looking at the levels of our

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,920
base saturation right here so

45
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,519
of low and high base saturation but base

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
saturation is calculated

47
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,118
as a percentage of cec and its kind

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,680
exchange capacity

49
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,920
occupied by base cations this figure

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
shows two soils with the same cec

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,759
but the soil on the right has more base

52
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,519
cations in blue

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,799
therefore it has a higher base

54
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,118
saturation

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,840
so base saturation is closely related to

56
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:00,159
ph as base saturation increases

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,840
so does ph levels so if we look at this

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,439
kind of comparison here between

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,080
our two soils so here we have the

60
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,318
low base saturation so down over here we

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
have the low base saturation

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,519
and then we have the high base

63
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,199
saturation we notice that the soil

64
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,239
particles so it's negative charges

65
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,759
and we have the same number of cations

66
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,039
essentially bound to that particle but a

67
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,439
low base saturation

68
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,359
we're seeing a low number of calcium

69
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,120
magnesium potassium

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,920
here at the high base saturation we can

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,439
see an increase in the amount of calcium

72
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,759
potassium and magnesium ions that are

73
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,239
again

74
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,000
being bound here to that soil particle

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
and those base cations are considered to

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,039
be calcium magnesium

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,080
potassium and then sodium acid cations

78
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,239
would be hydrogen

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,599
aluminum and ammonium here and they

80
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,719
exchangeable with the acidity

81
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,318
lower lower ph or more acidic levels

82
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,719
we'll see more of those

83
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,518
now word of caution with our uh when

84
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,239
looking at

85
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,000
base saturation if you're calculating

86
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,280
nutrient or fertilizer amounts from the

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,199
base saturation

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,039
typically these if you're utilizing

89
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,679
these numbers typically this will often

90
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,719
lead to an

91
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
over application of those nutrients it's

92
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,759
best to use

93
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,439
the specifics of the actual soil test

94
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,079
numbers and other factors

95
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,598
such as ph in organic matter a lot of

96
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,760
times sadly fertilizer companies will

97
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,518
use base saturation for this

98
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,280
to calculate the numbers because usually

99
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,439
it comes out in their favor

100
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
by over applying a little more nutrients

101
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,719
and more fertilizers

102
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,238
than you may need if you took into

103
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,840
account the actual numbers

104
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,400
as well as some of the other soil

105
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,158
properties provided on a soil test

106
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,640
regardless it still comes back to taking

107
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,598
a quality representative sample with

108
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,039
your soil test

109
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,959
so that you can have a good numbers

110
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,079
good data to work with so you can make

111
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,319
an informed

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,319
and educated decision going forward
