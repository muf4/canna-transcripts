1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
on this debaco university video we'll be

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,240
looking at

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,160
compressed carbon dioxide bottles for

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:17,519
carbon monoxide enrichment related to

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:19,839
cannabis production

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,679
so here we see a collection of bottles

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,480
and using compressed carbon dioxide

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,160
bottles for

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,160
cannabis production is very common

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,839
practice here just some examples of some

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,518
of the bottles that can be utilized

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,800
and let's go over some of the process

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,518
involved when you're looking at

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,558
implementing

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,320
this type of system so first off this is

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,439
the most common for hobby growers using

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,200
bottle system

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,558
many grow shops have bottle exchange

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,640
program which is great

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,399
typically this is only for the 20 pound

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,160
bottles as these are the most commonly

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,399
used for grow tents in small

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,000
operations realize it can be bottles as

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,520
small as five pounds or sometimes even

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,719
two and a half pounds

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,359
up to even way larger sizes than just 20

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,679
pounds

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,558
50 can be relatively common easy to

29
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,320
handle

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,599
they can also be 200-pound bottles it

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,159
can be very difficult

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,719
to get at that point 20 by far the most

33
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,960
common

34
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,719
and often used in its bottle exchange

35
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,079
program what that is is where you bring

36
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,798
an empty bottle you pick up a full

37
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,478
bottle

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,000
you empty that bottle you bring it back

39
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,359
you exchange that bottle for another

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,239
full bottle so you don't get the same

41
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,239
bottles back

42
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,640
but you always have a full 20 pound

43
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,640
bottle with this exchange program

44
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,040
now the bottle weight keep in mind is

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,960
only the weight of the carbon dioxide

46
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
so just a word of caution if you're

47
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,399
purchasing a 20 pound bottle

48
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,400
this is only the weight of the carbon

49
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,040
dioxide it does not include

50
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,640
the bottle weight so when purchasing 20

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,000
pounds of carbon dioxide it's likely

52
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,719
you're going to be lifting

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,840
or transporting closer to 40 pounds and

54
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,879
that depends

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,079
on the material the bottle is made from

56
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,560
aluminum is of course going to be

57
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,199
lighter than steel as far as the bottle

58
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
weight goes

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,399
but when you're purchasing bottles or

60
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,399
looking at oh 20 pound bottle

61
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
that is only the weight of the carbon

62
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,879
dioxide not including the canister

63
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,478
that's included in so keep that in mind

64
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,319
it's particularly important when you

65
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,399
have 50 pound bottles

66
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,839
so these are often more efficient way to

67
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,239
purchase carbon dioxide

68
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,759
but they can be more of a hassle

69
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,640
remember a 50 pound bottle of carbon

70
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,759
dioxide when

71
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,878
purchased will weigh about 170 pounds

72
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,719
so take care when transporting also just

73
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,000
a side note on the image

74
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,199
next to me here while it shows these

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,959
bottles and looks like they're nice

76
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,598
labeled with carbon dioxide

77
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,439
it should be capital c capital o with

78
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,679
two as a subscript

79
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,719
so this technically looks like cobalt

80
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,480
two uh

81
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,080
not carbon dioxide so that's just a

82
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,719
little bit of the science behind if you

83
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,400
wanna have

84
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,919
capital c capital o with 2 as a

85
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
subscript capital c

86
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,079
lowercase o actually means cobalt just a

87
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,399
side note there

88
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,519
so for size reference you know we talk

89
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
about these bottles you may

90
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,759
look at them online well how big are

91
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,599
these bottles aluminum carbon dioxide

92
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,560
cylinder information is provided here

93
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:53,840
and shows an

94
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,439
average height of a person to kind of

95
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,080
give you that idea of just how much

96
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,719
bigger

97
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,800
that 50 pound bottle is probably part of

98
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,039
the reason why the 20 pound is so common

99
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,280
20 compared to 15 even compared to 10

100
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,479
not all that big of a size difference

101
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,919
don't want to go much smaller because

102
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,598
you're going to be dosing your area with

103
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,479
that so 20 pound bottle probably the

104
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,878
most common for grow shops

105
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,840
so in general though why are bottles so

106
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,840
popular

107
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,840
you're purchasing pure carbon dioxide

108
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,120
and there's no byproduct or waste added

109
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,039
to your growing space

110
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,480
that's one of the reasons why compressed

111
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,039
carbon monoxide in bottle form

112
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,878
is so popular this can also reduce the

113
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,039
chance of plant damage

114
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,120
also controllers with fudges what's

115
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,039
called fuzzy logic can be used

116
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
which is another way to help increase

117
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,239
use efficiency

118
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,318
bottles also do not require special

119
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,640
storage conditions or maintenance

120
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,798
basically have an area that's chained

121
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,359
off to a fixed point and you're good to

122
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
go

123
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,280
there's no not a lot of other special

124
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,360
storage requirements that are needed

125
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,080
which makes them very easy to implement

126
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,439
into any particular growth space

127
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,640
however bottle danger in storage related

128
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,000
to safety

129
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,759
carbon dioxide cylinders should be

130
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,519
stored indoors

131
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,039
and should be stood upright against the

132
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,640
wall and secured with the chain to

133
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,120
ensure they cannot fall over and

134
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,878
potentially damage or rupture the valve

135
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
as we can see here with our valves

136
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,318
exposed you also want to try to get

137
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,719
bottles and i'll go back for a second

138
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,560
that have these protective coverings on

139
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
them these are the larger 50-pound

140
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,639
bottles

141
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,879
you'll also notice the smaller bottles

142
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,639
also have those not only does it protect

143
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,800
this from any sort of damage

144
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,280
it can also make for a great area to

145
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,240
lift or to carry these bottles from so

146
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,918
it's dual advantageous now back to our

147
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
kind of bottle danger

148
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,519
the area around the tank and cylinder

149
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
should be well ventilated if possible

150
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,120
and should be monitored with a carbon

151
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,399
dioxide safety alarm

152
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,600
carbon dioxide tanks and cylinders

153
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,039
should be stored in areas with a

154
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,639
temperature less than

155
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,759
125 degrees fahrenheit which is 51.7

156
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,519
degrees celsius

157
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,759
carbon oxide tanks and cylinders should

158
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,879
always be connected to a reducing valve

159
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,280
or regulator

160
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,800
with a pressure safety valve to prevent

161
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,038
any chance of

162
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,160
leading to an exploding bottle which is

163
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,560
just not

164
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,919
a safe environment for anyone around it

165
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,439
and also they can travel quite a

166
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,639
distance if that regulator was to break

167
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,399
off so it's good to have that carrying

168
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,000
handle slash protector

169
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,079
lastly if you do have a bottle or if you

170
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,680
look at a bottle there will be certain

171
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,279
markings on that model

172
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,879
so this kind of gives you just an idea

173
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,198
of what those what seems like random

174
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,719
numbers kind of a test to and match

175
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,879
and you can take a picture of your

176
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,000
bottle match it up here

177
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,879
to get an idea of what those numbers

178
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,319
actually mean as far as the safety

179
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,399
concerns for your bottle

180
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,839
it is you know good information to be

181
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,319
aware of that they're not just random

182
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,918
numbers

183
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,839
even though they may look like it they

184
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,799
actually can tell you quite a bit of

185
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,719
information

186
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,478
if you know how to read them and of

187
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,000
course here at debacle university

188
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,680
providing with the information for

189
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,759
something you may have taken

190
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,879
granted of earlier now you can develop

191
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,199
that understanding

192
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,199
for just what is on that bottle
