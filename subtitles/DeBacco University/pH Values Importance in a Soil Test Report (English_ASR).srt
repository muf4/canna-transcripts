1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,759
in this debaca university video i'm

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,240
going to go over why looking

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,759
at your ph values that you get back with

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:17,439
your soil test report

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:19,118
is so important

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,679
all right let's look at ph values

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:24,240
importance in the soil test report

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,759
so first off ph is the most important

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,239
and it's i know it's always hard to put

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,400
something

11
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,598
as the most important but one in doubt i

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,000
would say looking at your ph

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,719
is definitely very high if not the most

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,880
important

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,239
why because it impacts many plant and

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,160
nutrient aspects

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,599
if the ph is way off from your target

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,439
levels the rest

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,879
is much less important because when the

20
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,799
ph is adjusted

21
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,000
this can impact the availability of

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,640
other nutrients

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,159
remember soil test estimates to plant

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,399
available nutrients

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,279
not the total nutrients and this is just

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,280
a kind of a little

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,520
graphical representation that if we just

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,719
look at nitrogen here as an example

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,879
ph around seven uh pretty much that and

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,879
generally that

31
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:05,920
6.5 to kind of that little over seven

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,079
all in the green range

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,359
very available as we get more acidic or

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,200
more basic from that

35
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,560
we can see that the availability of that

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,040
particular nutrient will

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,680
decrease so this is why ph is very

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,680
important

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,960
because if our ph comes back very low

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,200
5.5

41
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,118
our phosphorus or potassium or sulfur

42
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,719
might be less plant available and show

43
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:25,280
up as less on a soil test because

44
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,959
remember

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
soil test is estimating the plant

46
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,000
available nutrients

47
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,680
not the total nutrients so what is ph

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
just in the general sense you would talk

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
about this

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
number that is that shows up it's a

51
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,039
decimal you know how does that kind of

52
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,319
relate to um

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,439
you know the what's going on in the soil

54
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,839
uh what does that number kind of

55
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,279
represent and what ph is we might be

56
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,280
familiar with that ph scale it's a

57
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,159
measure of the soil's acidity

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,320
it's a range from 1 to 14 with 7 being

59
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,719
neutral representing pure water

60
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,438
ph values below 7 you can see here and

61
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,919
below

62
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:04,239
are considered to be acidic while those

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,879
above are considered to be alkaline

64
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,159
the ph of a soil is not only affects the

65
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,199
availability of necessary

66
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,919
plant nutrients but also the solubility

67
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,560
of potential toxic elements such as

68
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,479
aluminum

69
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,759
and lead this is another reason why it's

70
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,878
important to know

71
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,239
the ph value of your soil

72
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:23,840
now we want to follow the lab

73
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,319
recommendations so here we see a soil

74
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,239
report

75
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,759
and they will often offer lab

76
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,599
recommendations as far as

77
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,878
amount of limestone or sulfur to be

78
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,039
adding and the

79
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,479
soil lab you select will know not only

80
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,318
the ph of your sample

81
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,079
but also if they're offering

82
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,280
recommendations they will calculate the

83
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,120
buffer capacity

84
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,318
which a buffer is simply resistance to

85
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,200
ph change

86
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,958
in relation to your soil type utilizing

87
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,079
all these factors will help produce a

88
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,479
good starting point

89
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
for correcting your soil's ph if it does

90
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,598
need to be corrected

91
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,598
remember though that the lab is only as

92
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,439
good as the sample you provide them

93
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,679
so make sure it is a representative

94
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,598
sample of the entire growing area

95
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,280
not just a single site to ensure the ph

96
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,238
adjustment will maximize plant for

97
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,800
performance

98
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,280
over the entire field and again follow

99
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,840
the

100
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,680
lab recommendations here they offer a

101
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,560
great starting point and you can see

102
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
over time

103
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,479
how that field how that soil may react

104
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,079
sometimes you make a

105
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,000
ph correction and it'll stay for a

106
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,280
number of years other times you need to

107
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,878
constantly

108
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,719
retest your soil and remaking

109
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,039
adjustments because some for

110
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:31,039
every reason shift from where your

111
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,039
target or ideal range would be
