1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,089
so based on the Lee experiments Mendell

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,950
developed and did he came up with some

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,929
laws and some theories look at some of

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,059
those right here again studying just a

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,960
simple garden pea in his monastery in

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:17,519
Austria so again he's the first one to

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,160
come up with the idea heredity and

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,859
considered the father of modern genetics

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,948
they worked with garden peas in his

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,210
monastery in Austria one of the first

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,039
things he came up with Holmes first

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,859
theories he came up with is the

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,390
fundamental theory of heredity parents

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,789
do not transmit traits directly to their

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,070
offspring they do so via factors called

16
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:40,530
genes and this is we're tracking in our

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,899
punnett squares remember our genes are a

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,329
segment of DNA that encodes for a very

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,840
specific amino acid sequence or a

20
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,859
specific protein how genes influence

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,899
traits well this should look familiar

22
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,988
the central dogma here going from our

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,789
DNA to RNA to our proteins the amino

24
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,619
acid sequence determines the shape and

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,420
activity of the proteins proteins

26
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:01,649
determined in large measure or what the

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,439
body looks like and how it functions

28
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,079
potentially its color and this its

29
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,179
structure mutations in the gene result

30
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,950
in alleles and this ultimately leads to

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,770
a change in the amino acid sequence and

32
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,329
also the activity of the protein natural

33
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:17,579
selection may favor one allele over

34
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,349
another so it's important to remember a

35
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,408
mutation does not necessarily

36
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:24,390
automatically mean a bad thing mutation

37
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,390
it simply means that there's been a

38
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,549
change in the gene whether it's a good

39
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,560
change or a bad change will result from

40
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,770
the environment or the natural selection

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,439
that occurs so if it's advantageous to

42
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,090
have blue eyes or brown eyes that's

43
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:43,169
going to be softened by the environment

44
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,750
other mutations will be again determined

45
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,969
whether or not they're beneficial based

46
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,420
on the environment that they're in if

47
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:52,739
you have webbing on your hands you're

48
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,960
going through and doing a lot of quick

49
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:56,339
typing that may not be advantageous but

50
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,199
if you're in duck swimming in the water

51
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,009
and you lose the webbing that would not

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,340
be a good thing

53
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,319
so again depends on the environment

54
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,030
other law law of segregation during

55
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,709
reproduction the alleles that determine

56
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,050
traits are separated into reproductive

57
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:13,348
cells by a process called meiosis and

58
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,590
randomly unites during fertilization the

59
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:15,030
two

60
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,128
alleles of a gene separate when forming

61
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,300
gametes in the game it's combined rarely

62
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:21,929
to common offsprings this is our

63
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,150
segregation here see randomly segregated

64
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,000
randomly placed in two different cells

65
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,739
that will then merge together with an

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,810
egg and a sperm or egg and a pollen

67
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,539
grain when you're forming the actual

68
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,580
Zygo this segregation is just that

69
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,400
separating out or segregating where

70
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,019
those alleles go

71
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,569
since help me look getting since the

72
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,849
males the female form in our seeds so we

73
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:47,578
have our pollen grain here in our egg

74
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:49,169
merging together form seed a or in this

75
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:52,560
case seed B if you have different

76
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:54,689
segregation that's occurring how this

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,670
may look in looking color if it was as

78
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:59,009
simple as being simply orange or green

79
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:01,139
if you took a pure orange and it was a

80
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:03,149
capital o capital o and a pure green to

81
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,848
lowercase G's you bred these together

82
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,039
ideally we would have all orange

83
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:09,750
offspring but all these would be

84
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:12,568
heterozygous because they would all have

85
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,189
the green gene also there if you were to

86
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:18,259
breed these together you'd get opponent

87
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:21,269
squared like this in 25% of the green

88
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:23,849
the other 75% that would be orange and

89
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,009
again it's phenotypic way of speaking

90
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,888
Geno typically speaking only one would

91
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:32,429
be double dominant orange the other to

92
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:34,859
be heterozygous as Olaf was in the law

93
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,599
of independent assortment so here genes

94
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:37,980
located on different chromosomes will be

95
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:39,810
inherited independently from one another

96
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:42,629
that means if you have a gene on

97
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,939
chromosome 1 chromosome 9 they're gonna

98
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,379
be inherited independently of one

99
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,150
another this is their independent

100
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,310
assortment all the genes of hidden

101
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,200
chromosome wanna be moved over

102
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,930
chromosome 9 removes separately this is

103
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,358
independent assortment of sorting things

104
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,540
and basically an independent in often

105
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:01,950
random way this is how it looks

106
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,168
independent from one in segregation is

107
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,388
were filming our dihybrid cross here if

108
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:08,340
M is the symbol for female in male and

109
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:11,359
you can see our segregation image

110
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,650
independent assortment image here

111
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,870
something else that adds to genetic

112
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,500
variability is crossing over and we

113
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,358
looked at this during meiosis 1 longest

114
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,399
chromosomes basically come into contact

115
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,319
one another and a little part of one can

116
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,029
we can combine with another part of

117
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,509
another meaning one can break off and

118
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:30,629
train

119
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:33,029
for over it's an exchange in the

120
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:34,800
positions of the chromosomes to make

121
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:36,869
information is exchanged between

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,000
homologous chromosomes from other

123
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,920
basically getting lined up and we have

124
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,540
one kind of flipping positions with the

125
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,610
other that's what this shows right here

126
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,800
the to become a chromosomes are then

127
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,830
formed so this adds the genetic

128
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,420
variability of an osprey now random

129
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:53,729
fertilization occurs a single egg

130
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,650
fertilized by a single sperm it's

131
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,750
important remember you're a very unique

132
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:59,969
individual considering independent

133
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,980
Cermak in a random fertilization and

134
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,320
offspring represents one out of 72

135
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,900
trillion

136
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:08,969
yes--that's trillion Saigo possibilities

137
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:12,029
there's about eight and a half million

138
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,100
different ways to make individual

139
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:16,799
different sperm and eighty-five million

140
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,840
different ways to make an egg so eight

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
point five million times the 8.5 million

142
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,169
excuse me eight point five million times

143
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,830
eight point five million will give you

144
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,879
72 trillion zygote possibilities so you

145
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:28,079
may ask initially the question what

146
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,269
about identical twins

147
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,490
well after fertilization after the

148
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:34,169
zygotes made if that saigo then is to

149
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,920
divide after the fact they would have

150
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:40,020
two identical twins this is the odds one

151
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,569
in swimming two trillion that a

152
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:45,990
genetically identical sperm will be

153
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:49,500
identically identical eggs so you're

154
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,970
very unique there's a multiple traits

155
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,129
we're gonna look at this we do dihybrid

156
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,530
crosses here remember at it's like a

157
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:57,480
pupil MS inheriting white or purple

158
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:59,489
flowers might be parroting things

159
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,450
together and that's the point of this

160
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:06,180
dihybrid cross which we'll go over first

161
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,680
a little vocabulary here each parent

162
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,050
contains two copies of a factor

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,519
governing each trait if the two copies

164
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,680
are the same they're called homozygous

165
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,049
as we see here capital B capital B this

166
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,180
is homozygous if two copies are

167
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,340
differently recalled heterozygous in

168
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,920
this case would be heterozygous it may

169
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,629
be a little B little B in a big B here

170
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,150
are two little bees is also homozygous

171
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:30,480
this be homozygous recessive speak

172
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:32,609
homozygous dominant our alleles are

173
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,379
forms of factors that lead to different

174
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,080
traits alternate forms are called

175
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:39,420
alleles so hearing here at one from

176
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,399
parent one and parent two in this case

177
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,930
allele for both tall genes

178
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,779
here from parent one it's getting a

179
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,790
wrinkled Peapod and here it's hitting

180
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,679
his smooth again different alleles the

181
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:53,009
Penguins dominant or recessive will

182
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,090
determine is expressed gives you the

183
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,979
alleles being transmitted through an

184
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:57,750
inbred pedigree again that family tree

185
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,279
we can trace things through this that's

186
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,959
why it's important to understand these

187
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,258
and recognize some of these this is a

188
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,418
very basic one phenotype and genotype

189
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,729
you've heard you mention phenotype is

190
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,948
how an individual may look genotype is

191
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:12,750
the actual genetics so here's our

192
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,600
genotypes represented here by our

193
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,519
capital and lowercase w's and our

194
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,060
phenotypes normal wings in this case

195
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:23,728
wrinkled wings is our phenotype most of

196
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:27,449
wrinkled wings is a homozygous recessive

197
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:30,029
genotype and the dominant is for normal

198
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,830
wings again there's dominant recessive

199
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:33,888
alleles the two alleles and individual

200
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:36,930
possesses do not affect one another

201
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:38,848
again endowment versus recessive Davin's

202
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,038
going to be expressed the excessive will

203
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:44,490
only be expressed in the homozygous

204
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,769
recessive state devil is represented by

205
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:50,038
uppercase letters recessive by lowercase

206
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:51,990
letters is dominant alleles expressed

207
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:53,969
the phenotype on at least one of those

208
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,478
alleles is present they can be the

209
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:00,180
heterozygous or the homozygous recessive

210
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:03,259
is only expressed as a phenotype when

211
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,699
both copies both from both parents are

212
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:07,199
represented in this case two little arse

213
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,870
therefore the pewdie wrinkled because

214
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,319
it's a recessive trait versus two round

215
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,418
tray

216
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,370
we don't know if this one is almost I

217
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:15,870
guess dominant or heterozygous we do

218
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,449
know there's at least one allele though

219
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:22,379
that is in the dominant or round

220
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:24,419
genes are homologous chromosomes

221
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,129
there's same size the same shape that

222
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:28,649
carry genes for the same trait but

223
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:30,360
they're not necessarily identical in

224
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,718
this case here's a heterozygous here

225
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,700
different genes might be located can

226
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:40,289
just be one from dad one from mom it's Y

227
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:42,300
or 2n organisms diploid and in this case

228
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:44,218
we have a lot of homo sinus dominance

229
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,729
has to be the same in this case they're

230
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:50,250
not identical these chromosomes one

231
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,629
allele from mom one allele from dad each

232
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,940
trait is determined by adherence of

233
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:55,649
those two alleles the alleles present in

234
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,869
the chromosome are distributed to Kami's

235
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:59,188
during meiosis this why we have so many

236
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,800
different possibilities because there's

237
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:03,799
so many different genes that can

238
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:07,078
recombination in many different ways

239
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,639
doubt recessive inheritance then there's

240
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:10,649
something called carriers I want to draw

241
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,019
your attention to in our punnett squares

242
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,568
here a carrier would be represented a

243
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,610
heterozygous those be a carrier here

244
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:19,828
meaning it's not recessive genes not

245
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,079
going to be expressed it's carried its

246
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:23,849
present there and it may show up in the

247
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:27,899
offspring it will not show up in that

248
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:30,209
particular individual some traits of

249
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,948
current arranged as a possibility and I

250
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:33,928
wanted instance always clear cut and dry

251
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:36,299
with pea plants though it is pretty

252
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:39,448
clear cut and dry I color for one in

253
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:41,609
particular is when it varies a lot so in

254
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:43,139
the case of how can two people with

255
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,149
brown ions have someone with blue eyes

256
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:47,850
gets into a little bit of the

257
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:50,009
complexities of genetics here the odds

258
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,990
are definitely for brown eyes but

259
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:53,909
because it's a dominant there's many

260
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,649
different traits that can occur creating

261
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:58,139
genotypes that can represent that same

262
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,360
phenotype those different genotypes can

263
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,709
result in different offspring however

264
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,839
you have two people with blue eyes

265
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:05,698
because that's a recessive trait the

266
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,689
eyes are very much in the favor of the

267
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:10,948
offspring to also have blue eyes

268
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:12,509
recessive traits again that carrier

269
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,948
aspects the presence of an allele does

270
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,589
not ensure the trait will be expressed

271
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:18,599
individual individual as an example of

272
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:21,269
recessive trait so here we have two

273
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,220
carriers yes they can produce 25% of

274
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:26,759
offspring and homozygous dominant but

275
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,949
25% make homozygous recessive the other

276
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,139
50% will be carriers of that particular

277
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:33,240
trait not expressing it carrying that

278
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,850
recessive allele again recessive does

279
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,620
not necessary mean that autosomal

280
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,480
dominant is one possible way for a trait

281
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,438
or a disorder in some cases to be

282
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:46,110
inherited as we see here and also down

283
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:48,088
disease if the abnormal genes inherited

284
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,308
only from one parent disease will be

285
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:53,850
present so in this case if it's a

286
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:56,188
dominant disorder or disease it's going

287
00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:01,379
to be expressed even if only one allele

288
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:02,879
is there the recessive though means an

289
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,249
organism needs two copies of that gene

290
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,798
in order to express that if only one

291
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:08,639
copy is present expression will not

292
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:10,709
occur

293
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,750
personally considered a carrier and that

294
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,940
person being a carrier will not be

295
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,730
infected themselves but can still pass

296
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,390
that on to their offspring and if an

297
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,090
offspring of an autosomal recessive

298
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:26,129
basically combination of alleles

299
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,629
typically the parents are carriers so if

300
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:29,939
the offspring represents it but the

301
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:32,490
parents do not the parents are likely to

302
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,650
be carriers hopefully this is helpful in

303
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,970
explaining a little bit about heredity

304
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,970
and genetics
