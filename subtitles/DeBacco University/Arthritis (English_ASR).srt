1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
here we're gonna investigate arthritis

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,150
not while this is a general term that

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:09,359
you may have heard of before we're going

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,609
to focus in this video lecture on two

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,570
main different types of classifications

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:17,009
with under the large branch of authoress

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,740
so in general arthritis is an

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,779
inflammatory and degenerative disease

9
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,118
one more than a hundred different types

10
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,820
of inflammatory or degenerative diseases

11
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,160
at damaged joints arthritis is the most

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,140
widespread and crippling a disease in

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,488
the u.s. sometimes our pain stiffness

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,590
and swelling of a joint

15
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,839
acute forms are caused by bacteria and

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,940
treated with antibiotics so it's

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,980
important to keep in mind that while we

18
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,869
have this general term it's actually a

19
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,898
lot of subsets and a lot of different

20
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,849
types of arthritis so what works for one

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,558
person may not work for another

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,379
two chronic forms that we're going to

23
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,259
focus on here or include osteoarthritis

24
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,030
in rheumatoid arthritis staring with

25
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,149
osteoarthritis which I'll be VA o

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,210
capital o capital a is the most common

27
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,939
chronic arthritis often calls called the

28
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,920
wear and tear arthritis fix women more

29
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,649
than men about eighty-five percent of

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,140
all Americans will develop some form of

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,750
osteoarthritis it's more prevalent with

32
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,228
the aged and elderly it's probably

33
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,000
related to normal aging process so

34
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:23,579
deceiving the idea of what a normal hip

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,228
joint would look nice and smooth on that

36
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,298
cartilage there or allowing these

37
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:29,938
gliding motions between these two bones

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,979
articulating here we have exposed bone

39
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,408
we have that breakdown that worn

40
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:38,728
cartilage this is an example of

41
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,890
osteoarthritis the course of an

42
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:43,200
osteocyte is can we see a picture of a

43
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,390
nice normal mean a smooth shiny look and

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,390
osteoarthritis at breaking it out of

45
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,280
that cartilage osteoarthritis reflects

46
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,700
the years of abrasion and compression

47
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,920
it's caused by increased production of a

48
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,368
mellow protonates enzyme that breaks

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,599
down cartilage as one ages cartilage is

50
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:03,509
destroyed more quickly than it's

51
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,879
replaced the exposure of bone ends

52
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,080
thickened and large form bone spurs and

53
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:12,359
restrict movement joints most affected

54
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,319
our cervical and lumbar spine fingers

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,180
knuckles the

56
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,488
and hips so you can kind of see that

57
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,439
purple region is located here are areas

58
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,498
that tend to be most affected by

59
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:25,979
osteoarthritis treatment for this

60
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:29,068
particular issue sadly this is a slow

61
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:32,369
progression and also irreversible

62
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:34,408
disease there are some potential

63
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,629
treatments and they include mild pain

64
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:41,280
relievers magnetic therapy potentially

65
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:44,638
glucosamine sulfate increases pain and

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,840
inflammation in extreme cases you may

67
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,329
have known someone that's gone through

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,039
what's called joint replacement they're

69
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:54,090
actually replacing a portion of that

70
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:56,548
joint and removing that damaged area and

71
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,090
replacing it with in this case usually a

72
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,790
titanium or some sort of synthetic

73
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,438
product to replace that joint with in

74
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,269
this example here we see total knee

75
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:09,358
replacement this would be an example of

76
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,650
the femur or a hip replacement it can

77
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:14,760
also occur in small areas Defenders

78
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,879
rheumatoid arthritis is the other type

79
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:20,219
and this is Ruby ated RA so this chronic

80
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,438
inflammation autoimmune disease of

81
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,289
unknown cause usually this occurs

82
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:27,900
between the ages of 40 and 50 however it

83
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,429
may occur at any age what we're seeing

84
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,219
in this image here are normal joint

85
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,629
again at nice smooth parents and here

86
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,669
we're seeing that joint affected by

87
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:38,489
rheumatoid arthritis we're still losing

88
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,370
cartilage we had this inflammation we

89
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,349
could have bone loss on all other

90
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,789
negatives that could occur on signs and

91
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:49,798
symptoms include joint tenderness

92
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:52,108
osteoporosis muscle atrophy curta

93
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,479
vascular problems all these committed to

94
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:55,769
rheumatoid arthritis the course of

95
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,989
rheumatoid arthritis is marked with

96
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,509
exacerbations and remissions in this

97
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:04,289
boom and bust the key part here that is

98
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:07,198
an autoimmune disease course re begins

99
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:09,888
with the inflammation of synovial

100
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,719
membranes that the affected joint

101
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:15,269
inflammation of blood cells migrate to

102
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:17,788
the joint causing swelling the end

103
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:20,489
result we could produce deformed fingers

104
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:22,860
in extreme cases so again because it's

105
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:25,288
an autoimmune disease the immune system

106
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,770
is involved here we have b-cells and

107
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:28,568
t-cells

108
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:30,879
of our immune system being brought to

109
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:33,550
the area on we have this kind of

110
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:38,769
reaction that's basically occurring and

111
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:40,150
this occurs in rheumatoid arthritis now

112
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:43,168
we were to a surprising treatment

113
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:45,848
there's many different potential options

114
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:47,769
there's conservative therapy such as

115
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:49,418
aspirin or long-term antibiotics

116
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:52,240
there's progressive treatments for

117
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:54,609
anti-inflammatory drugs and there's some

118
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,800
other biological response modifiers that

119
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,158
neutralize the harmful properties of

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,110
those inflammatory chemicals so because

121
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:04,329
it's autoimmune different things may

122
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,220
work better for different people now

123
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:08,680
comparing the two rheumatoid to

124
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,720
osteoarthritis it's a great chart that

125
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,658
tries to put some of the features in the

126
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,030
comparison age of onset we're taking

127
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:19,719
happen at any age osteoarthritis you use

128
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:22,568
usually later in life rheumatoid very

129
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,940
rapid onset Asir is a very slow occurs

130
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:27,539
over years okay because it's autoimmune

131
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:30,939
to concur very quickly distribution

132
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:33,399
joints affected duration and kind of

133
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,199
your symptoms osteoarthritis because

134
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,269
it's not an autoimmune disease the

135
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,340
immune system is not involved there's

136
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:41,649
really no systemic symptoms involved

137
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:44,649
however rheumatoid SRS may come about

138
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:46,179
with fatigue fever in neck sweats just

139
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:48,429
being able to kind of compare some of

140
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,709
the two while they're both fall under

141
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,060
the classification of arthritis you can

142
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:54,549
see there's some clear and distinct

143
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,379
differences between these two and these

144
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,360
are just kind of the to chronic ones I

145
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,839
chose to compare for the purpose of this

146
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,840
video lecture
