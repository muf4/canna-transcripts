1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
all right in this tobacco university

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,519
video we're looking at the basic guide

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,160
to create your own

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,160
cannabis strain so this can be a very

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,800
time-consuming and detail-oriented

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,439
process

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,480
so just again a basic guide here to give

8
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,879
you an idea if

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,519
it's something you're considering so

10
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,439
first

11
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,039
you have to start somewhere even when

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,240
you're seeking to make a new strain you

13
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,039
have to start somewhere with some

14
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,799
material

15
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,640
determine what you want to breed for is

16
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,240
important meaning are you looking for

17
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,599
morphology the structure of the plant

18
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,000
the cannabinoids the terpenes the

19
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,920
flowering

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,439
time the yield the plant behavior or

21
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,239
potentially disease

22
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,920
resistance so it's important to know

23
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:38,718
what is currently available in the

24
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,239
market

25
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,600
once you know what you want to breed for

26
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,519
be sure to check to see if it already

27
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,960
exists or if it's something that's close

28
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,719
to what you want already exists you

29
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,359
don't waste the time going through that

30
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,920
yourself this may help you start with

31
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,558
material

32
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,600
and require less dramatic changes to get

33
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,679
to your goals

34
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,439
allowing for less time to get to the end

35
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,359
result which could be very important

36
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,280
in addition you can help reduce the

37
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,079
overall initial variability

38
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,519
to help get your your plan more specific

39
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,519
and refined

40
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,719
also knowing what's currently available

41
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,239
not only could they act as

42
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,158
starting material or eliminate

43
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,118
potentially with your breeding but can

44
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,040
also

45
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,640
see well it does take a long time and

46
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
also see what the market's kind of

47
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,239
favoring uh currently

48
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,919
and you might that may take some subtle

49
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,478
cues or try to get an idea where it's

50
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,920
going

51
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:27,280
to try to breed for the next big thing

52
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,320
your breeding goal

53
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,640
once you have kind of selected

54
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,239
your breeding goals choosing strains

55
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,159
that allow you to best achieve your

56
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,599
goals can then be selected

57
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,920
and you have to have that idea where

58
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,239
you're going be sure to have areas to

59
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,159
grow

60
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,000
male pollen producing plants that are

61
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
isolated from female plants

62
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
if you have multiple strains be sure

63
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,359
plants are isolated to only allow known

64
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
or chosen crosses to take place

65
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,280
so you know increase massive genetic

66
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,559
variability or have some mixing of

67
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,200
certain strains that you don't want to

68
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,079
have next for your end goal

69
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,520
isolation is an important part of the

70
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,478
process so when you're making crosses

71
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,920
between plants

72
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,840
you want to ensure that you know the

73
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,439
cross is being made in order for this to

74
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,959
occur both plants need to be isolated to

75
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,359
ensure the crosses being made

76
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
are known known genetic crosses not kind

77
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,480
of open pollinated crosses

78
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
this should include both physical

79
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,639
isolation and also you want to make sure

80
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,159
that your ventilation systems are also

81
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,399
isolated to avoid

82
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,400
unintentional travel of pollen if you

83
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
have an exhaust system from a male grow

84
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,080
tent going right into a female grow tent

85
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,680
it is very possible to pick up some of

86
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,719
that pollen because it carries in the

87
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,680
air so well

88
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,120
and unintentionally have that pollen

89
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
enter the female plants and get some

90
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
crossing going on

91
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,879
so make sure even your ventilation

92
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,839
systems are isolated

93
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,199
the time and labor required this is

94
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
something that will not occur in just

95
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,079
one generation you need to be

96
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,159
willing to commit to a long-term process

97
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
establishing growing areas and plants of

98
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,039
both male and female genders so seeds

99
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
can be produced

100
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:01,359
are essential this requires a space

101
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,280
and organization from organization from

102
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,120
your standpoint from the grower as well

103
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,719
as organization within the plants and

104
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,439
areas so this is just that consideration

105
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,878
to have

106
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,878
to make sure you have all this in place

107
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,479
before you start in this breeding

108
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,280
endeavor

109
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,639
plant health so while it's important to

110
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,919
keep your plants healthy no matter what

111
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,919
the situation is

112
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,679
for breeding it can be extra important

113
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,119
as you may only be working with

114
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,879
only one plant with very unique genetics

115
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,319
keeping the plant material healthy for

116
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,079
is extra importance

117
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,238
as there is no backups you can't just

118
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,159
start another round of seeds or

119
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,759
find another set of clones or order some

120
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,959
more in you're dealing with a very

121
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,719
unique individual so keep an individual

122
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,479
healthy is important because that's your

123
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,239
whole breeding program is based on that

124
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,359
particular plan

125
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,759
and i can't stress enough but the

126
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,519
importance of record keeping

127
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,199
record keeping allows for documentation

128
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,438
and this is critical to any successful

129
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,919
growing or breeding operation

130
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,199
documenting as you can see here dates

131
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,679
what you fed it with

132
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,878
the the types the varieties any sort of

133
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,400
things that you're noting

134
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,560
any sort of applications that you're

135
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,158
making any disease that you might be

136
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,039
seeing deficiencies

137
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,120
uh feeding cycles all in anything and

138
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,878
everything should be documented here

139
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
so you can have a great idea or a great

140
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,399
track record when you look

141
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,399
back at those varieties through the

142
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,159
breeding process

143
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,719
now i have other videos here kind of

144
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,960
listed to provide specifics and

145
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,000
how to select a canvas plant material

146
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,599
for breeding

147
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,279
selecting a male plant for cannabis

148
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
