1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
so looking at cannabis physiology now a

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,450
lot of times people think physiology I

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,910
think physical parts of the plant that's

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,380
not the case this is having to do with

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,780
kind of how the plant works or the

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,429
interior components of the plant you can

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,378
see here just plant physiology in

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,719
general takes into account a lot of

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,160
different factors plant morphologies

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,768
actually how the plant looks at the

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,600
basic structures physiology takes that

12
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,879
into consideration along with cellular

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,019
interactions the consumer biology and a

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,599
bunch of other things

15
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:33,539
so specifically physiology is the study

16
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,189
of the functions of an of organisms it

17
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,058
kind of tries to explain a little bit

18
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:38,488
how they work

19
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,078
some key physiological processes and

20
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,599
plants I'm going to talk about our

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,700
tropisms and nastic movements hormones

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,410
photoperiodism pigments transpiration

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,469
plant diseases and also the very

24
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:51,209
important photosynthetic process so

25
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,550
first off autotroph ism's growth in

26
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,500
response to a stimulus ISM example the

27
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,808
a' plant bending towards the light

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,469
source and via phototropism and roots

29
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,500
growing down

30
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,600
that's a gravitropism it's responding to

31
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,239
gravity NASA goons are kind of showed

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,790
here and this adjusts its plants moving

33
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,739
response to environmental stimulus on

34
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,900
the direction of the movement may or may

35
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,739
not be correlated with the stimulus you

36
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,509
can see this is a sensitive plant well

37
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,759
most of say someone poke the end here

38
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,769
you can see that knows all of the

39
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,959
resulting effects here of the plants

40
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,149
building let's do this or this plant

41
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,030
particularly does this to try to reduce

42
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,740
impact from herbivores also may have

43
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,900
seen a Venus flytrap that you know will

44
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:37,500
close and that's kind of the same

45
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,270
example of a nasty movement plant

46
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,030
hormones are chemical substances that

47
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:44,640
regulate plant cell processes they can

48
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,670
produce a significant response despite

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,590
extremely low concentrations some key

50
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,719
ones ought to be familiar with abscisic

51
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,728
acid auxins had a kind of thing in

52
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,429
gibberellins we're going to go into

53
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:57,929
these in detail and other lectures but

54
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,640
this just gives you an idea or at least

55
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,509
familiarize yourself with some of these

56
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,189
common and hormones photoperiodism is

57
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,078
response to a change in day length

58
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,788
though accurate more accurately

59
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:10,889
described to be stated as response to

60
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,799
the change in continual length of night

61
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,899
time of uninterrupted darkness over 24

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,170
recycle we have heard of some plants

63
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,330
called short days or long day conditions

64
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:23,009
in the summer or the winter kind of

65
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,860
based on the tilt of the earth and how

66
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,479
that affects things photo period is very

67
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,180
important for cannabis because it can

68
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,969
signal to either produce more leaves put

69
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,950
into a vegetative state or produce

70
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,199
flowers which call you another flowering

71
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:38,429
period so you can some cannabis plants

72
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,949
depending on the hours you give them

73
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,159
will change the various habits or

74
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:46,889
morphology that they take on pigments

75
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,539
are important such as chlorophyll v1 the

76
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,699
main purpose of pigments is to aid in

77
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,989
the photosynthetic process by increasing

78
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,030
the total out of the light that can be

79
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,439
captured chlorophylls the most

80
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,479
predominant pigment which gives it

81
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,689
leaves their green color we see that

82
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,310
ended right here other pigments are

83
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:03,840
called anthocyanins they're purple

84
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,659
pigments they're classified as

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,330
flavonoids in the intact wavelength of

86
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:12,359
light that's absorbed the purple coast

87
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,969
purple haze purple skunk all these are

88
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,460
have increased amounts of anthocyanin or

89
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:19,439
engagement of purple coloration kind of

90
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,590
see that purple coming through here this

91
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,139
maturing flower bud and different ones

92
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,789
will have different colorations but some

93
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,329
of those collisions are related to the

94
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:31,409
pigments in this case and silent

95
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,300
transpiration is a very important plant

96
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:35,280
process it's a process which carries

97
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,439
water from the roots of the plant to the

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,229
shoots and ultimately out the leaves as

99
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,060
water vapor now this helps the plant

100
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:43,949
move water and nutrients dissolved in

101
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,270
the plant this platelets don't have

102
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:47,280
blood they're kind of using this water

103
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,050
can absorb in the roots into the shoots

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,349
find minerals to be dissolved in they're

105
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,060
allowing it to cool itself also that's

106
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,729
its number-one task it's used for the

107
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,370
cooling process even though some is used

108
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:00,988
for proposed synthesis the rate of

109
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,759
transpiration or the rate that waters

110
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,129
move through here is depend a couple of

111
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,859
factors it's directly related to

112
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,479
temperature and sunlight intensity so

113
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,250
you can see as temperature increases to

114
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,289
a certain point but as temperature

115
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,430
increases so does transpiration divet

116
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:19,738
clone itself in wind velocity here we as

117
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,569
we increase the wind we're increasing

118
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,859
the amount of water that is being

119
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:25,110
evaporated out

120
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,629
it's indirectly proportional to the

121
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,720
humidity levels so you can see as RF you

122
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:32,850
increases our transpiration rate will

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,100
decrease this is simply because if

124
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,650
there's more moisture in the air there's

125
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,750
no place for that water vapor in the

126
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,979
leaf to go anywhere think about if

127
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,839
you're never in the summertime it's

128
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,420
really humid and kind of stick to bank

129
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,489
the car seat or something it just feels

130
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,590
like clothes stick to more that's

131
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,620
because there's a very high rate of

132
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:54,509
humidity very high rate now a lot of

133
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,709
water to evaporate well into that

134
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:57,750
external environment

135
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:59,939
there's also plant disease which is a

136
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,709
very broad topic but in general it's an

137
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:02,459
infection that can alter the physiology

138
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:04,259
of the plant

139
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,609
even though plants do not have white

140
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,860
blood cells like we do like in our

141
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,319
immune systems they still have defense

142
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,949
mechanism present here we see a canvas

143
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,000
plant with powdery mildew on it

144
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,069
photosynthesis is the last step here

145
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,980
that's a complex process it uses light

146
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:23,040
water carbon oxide to process or produce

147
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,080
sugar molecules and oxygen as a

148
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,300
byproduct understanding this process

149
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,889
could help improve the quality quantity

150
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,840
and quality of cannabis that is

151
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,939
harvested so while it's present is very

152
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,500
you know quickly easy here

153
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,810
understanding this especially with

154
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,610
artificial lighting can really change

155
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,480
the quality of cannabis that will be

156
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,480
produced by a grower
