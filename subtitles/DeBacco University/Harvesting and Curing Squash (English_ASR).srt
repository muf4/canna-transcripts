00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
okay here I'm going to go over your

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:06,000
harvesting and curing the squash and the

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,460
curing process which I'm going to focus

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,888
on here applies only to your winter

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,750
squash summer squash will be harvested

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:14,879
daily and sold with their relatively

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,460
short shelf life but curing a winter

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,850
squash can significantly increase its

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,800
shelf life so far our winter squash the

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,580
length of time that you can store it

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,109
will depend on the particular variety

12
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:30,089
delicata will only store for about three

13
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,940
months while some others can last almost

14
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:36,030
a calendar year we want to harvest in

15
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:38,759
mid to late September or about 60 days

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,920
from pollination often color can be a

17
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,869
poor indicator so look at the stem and

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,550
the days from pollination as an

19
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,038
indication whether that will be ready

20
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,689
for curing and harvesting you want to

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,520
cut this stem right at the volume you

22
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,259
want to bring all of your squash from

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,059
the field and store them in an area of

24
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,729
about 80 degrees Fahrenheit for about a

25
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,709
week with some Sun some good air

26
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,349
circulation want to put them in an area

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,808
that's gonna hold a lot of moisture open

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,728
bins slotted bins here Medinah pellets

29
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:08,188
allow for air circulation and they are

30
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,260
advantageous give you some links here

31
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:12,569
for some fact sheets and some ideas and

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,180
how to properly cure your squash so you

33
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:17,179
get the longest storage time possible
