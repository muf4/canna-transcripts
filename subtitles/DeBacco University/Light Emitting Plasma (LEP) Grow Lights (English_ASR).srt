1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,190
okay here we give a brief overview of

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:08,580
light emitting plasmas or lights or LEP

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,070
grow lights we see one right here a

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,289
small little jelly bean or peanut area

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,019
is where the light comes from and while

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:19,320
that is a very small initial starting

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:21,198
point it can easily cover a sufficient

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,778
we're like competitive with most

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,279
high-intensity to discharge lights now

10
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,490
plasma girl a chair it's a near full

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,829
spectrum light and they are incredibly

12
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:34,199
energy efficient they have low wattage

13
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,909
solid-state bulbs that are in the full

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,850
spectrum of light from ultraviolet

15
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:41,699
infrared and all with no moving parts or

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,859
electrodes and here is the LEP light

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,079
there's similar to ceramic metal halides

18
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,509
that we see here just kind of on a quick

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,710
visual comparison and we can clearly see

20
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:51,269
the difference between these due to a

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,308
high pressure sodium light in the

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,379
background of this image now the

23
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,599
advantages of plasma lights is they have

24
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,089
no basically minimal moving parts

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,219
they're very quiet operation however

26
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,010
they're fixed they can't dim them at all

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,530
they're very expensive in comparison to

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,439
ceramic metal halides and the emitter

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,049
which can which can fail over time is

30
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,209
often not replaced so because of these

31
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,460
reasons probably certificate of Hines

32
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:21,889
there tend to be more popular than all

33
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:21,889
the benefits associated with LDP lights
