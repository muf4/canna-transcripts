1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
I have yet to find a farm that is free

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:06,990
of problems but what separates some of

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,480
the more successful farms from the less

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,580
successful ones is how they manage for

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,429
problems and while you can't plan for

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,960
everything some things can be managed

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,050
for sometimes you can have a plan in

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,609
place to help reduce the problems or the

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,550
impact that it may have in your

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,070
operation so this competitors planning

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,830
ahead for some of the common or expected

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,448
problems I see here we got pari mildew

13
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,000
on squash late and early Blanton

14
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,289
Tomatoes leaf hoppers on potatoes I'll

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,270
remember there's more than just disease

16
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,359
issues to consider we're not thinking

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,030
about insects when I think about some

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,519
other impacts that could happen such as

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,649
staking and wind or weather related

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,370
things animals so there's more than just

21
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,689
disease issues that we need to plan for

22
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:53,459
plating head for the some common

23
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,320
expected problems I said squash and

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,520
powdery mildew almost a guarantee you're

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,738
gonna get that especially later in the

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,390
season at fruit set Tomatoes early

27
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,000
blight for sure hopefully not late

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,159
blight irrigation in some instances for

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,400
certain fields potatoes have the leaf

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,719
hoppers carrots for growing carrots

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,490
you're doing some form of weeding what

32
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,920
we're gonna have in place these flame

33
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:16,019
weeding you're gonna use solarization

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,210
gonna handpick what are gonna go through

35
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,030
and do broccoli animals to get the

36
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:22,169
woodchucks and as I show here you know

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,450
this doesn't relate to exactly to

38
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,159
growing but when it snows are you ready

39
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,618
with a snow blower do you have chains to

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,390
go on the tires are you plan planning

41
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,099
ahead for this you don't want to have it

42
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,219
snow and then realize that you've never

43
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:38,429
seen snow before again an idea and place

44
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,109
it in the equipment ready to go problems

45
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,020
and general solutions again this is just

46
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,219
a quick kind of one-hit summary here if

47
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,250
you have a fungus problem you use

48
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,780
fungicides bacteria bacteria sides virus

49
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,209
you want to use vector prevention

50
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,129
typically viruses come in with insects

51
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,359
want to prevent the insects new

52
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,129
treatment balance when I do a soil test

53
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,828
you can have an idea what's low what's

54
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,959
high water no your field where's the wet

55
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:04,709
spots where the dry spots insects

56
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,419
there's many options with those animals

57
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,549
usually a physical barrier works the

58
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,920
best environmental there's only so much

59
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,469
you can do and grower error look in the

60
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,159
mirror for who to blame you can make a

61
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,859
mistake

62
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,889
can only make it once for disease

63
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,770
management prevention is step one if

64
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:24,659
you're going to apply a corrective spray

65
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:27,330
read the label there's chemical and

66
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,520
organic options for spray products

67
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,620
regardless rotations need to be

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,909
considered whether using organic or

69
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,090
chemical means

70
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:38,310
I love Benjamin Franklin's quote here an

71
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,170
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of

72
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,449
cure if you can try to prevent the

73
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:44,280
disease from occurring with may be

74
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:46,829
increasing plant spacing so there's more

75
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,479
air circulation planting not where

76
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,640
there's a wet portion of the field it

77
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,489
can really save you a lot later in the

78
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,319
season for insect management they send

79
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,969
their Holly variable with a lack in size

80
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,500
they coming up for in numbers this is a

81
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,500
little leaf hopper very very small

82
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,860
insect and this is a field I visited

83
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,240
with potatoes you could see this is

84
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,960
advanced advanced severe I would call

85
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,629
hopper burned but the leaf hoppers doing

86
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,070
this major damage to this crop how every

87
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,560
loss of potatoes growing here not too

88
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,500
far over really haven't touched these

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,289
crops still potatoes so different

90
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,099
varieties can it be favorited by some

91
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:27,810
insects versus others apply the physical

92
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,759
barriers a great way really the only

93
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,759
form of 100% control for insects you're

94
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,750
separating that with basically a screen

95
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,609
assuming there's a good seal with the

96
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,569
ground and the winds not blowing it up

97
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:41,760
there's also no tears in it so while it

98
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,319
does work a hundred percent then it's if

99
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,829
it's a hundred percent installed and

100
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,759
properly and 100% functional you don't

101
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,140
to have a tear in it and have the

102
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,609
insects get in and then be trapped on

103
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,939
the inside and God's actually a worse

104
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,840
situation also for insects we want to

105
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,789
consider good bugs

106
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,770
there's beneficial insects that do show

107
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:01,620
promise but timing is important for

108
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,989
releasing them we want to also provide

109
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,640
habitat and find a proper match that's

110
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,750
important for these beneficial insects

111
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:12,839
some are very specific which is great I

112
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,159
can buy them in various places online we

113
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,870
want to get them shipped at the right

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,519
time and you want to release them and

115
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,459
ensure you have a good environment for

116
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,439
those particular insects so they can be

117
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,259
able to survive and seek out some of the

118
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,209
bad bugs that you may have you can also

119
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,779
plan to trap crop so this is where the

120
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,759
perimeter play

121
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,559
you have that trial copy of your main

122
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,659
crop on the inside when I plant a

123
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,550
variety of crop that's favored by the

124
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,290
target insect I'd be on the outside

125
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,960
for example squash bugs like Blue

126
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,700
Hubbard squash in the some other

127
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,909
different types of squash varieties are

128
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,579
very good selections to make I suggested

129
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,680
though over here suggest that you start

130
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,269
about three weeks prior to the planting

131
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,910
of your summer squash winter squash

132
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:55,829
cucumber cantaloupe or watermelon so

133
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,620
timing again we went with the trap

134
00:04:55,829 --> 00:05:00,000
cop-out early so that the insects find

135
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,769
that it's a little bit more mature and

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,629
that's what you're going to monitor and

137
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,339
that can really reduce the impact on

138
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,230
your main crop because you're able to

139
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:09,239
control the insects or monitor if the

140
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,340
insects at the perimeter and it could

141
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,470
prevent them from getting to your main

142
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,819
crop or basically not spraying your main

143
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,070
crop you could be only spraying your

144
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,709
trap crop and many different options to

145
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:21,839
consider regardless so timing is

146
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,039
important timing the plant that can

147
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,228
influence pressure when you're planting

148
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,540
early or late also want to consider your

149
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:29,939
neighbors what their timing may be as

150
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,129
far as planting and someone goes in

151
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:35,339
really early that can increase insect

152
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:36,120
pressure potentially or really late in

153
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,159
the season

154
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,959
certain diseases could potentially come

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,540
over on earlier earlier or later

156
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,750
plantings it's like the baseball player

157
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,890
here timing is important to hit the ball

158
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,399
internal combustion engines timing is a

159
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,259
big deal also and that is really putting

160
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,620
this all together and getting the timing

161
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,449
right and make it really easier as you

162
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,610
go through the season but if you miss

163
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,139
your timing or don't plan properly you

164
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,509
can be fighting that and get very

165
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,159
frustrated so hopefully this helps you

166
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,349
develop at least a little bit of an idea

167
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,960
and put that plan together with the time
