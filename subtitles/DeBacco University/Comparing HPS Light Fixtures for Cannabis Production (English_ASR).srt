1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,480
if you're shopping for hps lighting here

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,798
at tobacco university i'm going to

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,359
provide a comparison of some common

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,839
light fixtures so it can help educate

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,678
your

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:17,920
process as you go through and make your

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,920
final selection

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,879
let's get into comparing hps light

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,399
fixtures for cannabis production

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,239
so first off as a disclaimer i've not

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,598
received any financial compensation for

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,439
writing the following product review i

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,480
have no material connection to the

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
brands products or services that i have

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,119
mentioned

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,879
so it's a standard for comparison so

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,000
we're comparing apples to apples or

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:41,839
oranges oranges

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,759
all the following are double ended 1 000

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,559
watt fixtures for each light i'll

21
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,519
provide the good

22
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,839
the bad and recommendations so starting

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,879
with our first one here the gavita pro

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,640
the gavita pro generates 2 100 micro

25
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,280
moles per second of light

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
light maintenance of over 96 percent per

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,679
5000

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,679
hours so you only need to replace it

29
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,280
once a year and there's a variety of

30
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,000
reflector options and they're easy to

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,840
change

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,159
the bat is minimum hanging distance is

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
one meter and it's best for areas that

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
are not

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,799
ceiling height limited the phantom

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,640
low profile is another example of a high

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,040
pressure sodium light

38
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,118
and they use this kind of european arc

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,560
tube material that outputs 2100

40
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,680
micromoles

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,400
per second the ppf of in the 400 to 700

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
nanometers

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,799
and 2 330 micromoles per second

44
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:35,599
of the 280 to 800 nanometers area when

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,799
operated at a thousand watts so very

46
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:41,839
powerful light 10 000 hour service

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,479
lifetime reduces operational expenses it

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,520
is

49
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,399
a long light in shape for um size and

50
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,959
mounting

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,560
and it has a side mounted uh power cord

52
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,078
there so it's kind of

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,478
not really the best we can string them

54
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,759
together might create a little bit of

55
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,280
an issue when you're trying to go

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,718
through and make everything clean neat

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,239
and tidy in your grow area

58
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,679
this is a low profile that allows

59
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,679
ceiling height limited growers to

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,040
utilize the light so that's an advantage

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,640
to this one

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,159
now if i was only to select one and

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,759
again i didn't provide a ton of options

64
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,878
but the gavita pro would get my

65
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,399
recommendation

66
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,719
i have purchased these lights at least

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
in the 600 watt area

68
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,039
no growers that have used a thousand

69
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
watts and i find them simple reliable

70
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,759
and easy to change reflectors so for

71
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,280
that that gets my initial recommendation

72
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,439
and the sense that's a good sense for

73
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,439
comparison hps lights are getting a

74
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,598
little bit harder to find with the

75
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,519
influx of other lighting sources but

76
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,639
still can produce a high quality crop on

77
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,239
hps lighting

78
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,839
don't even tell you otherwise it is

79
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,439
still possible and

80
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,360
with the reduction in price of the

81
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,598
fixtures overall it is

82
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,599
worthy of a consideration if you're

83
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,598
looking at still producing high yield

84
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,598
we're trying to reduce costs
