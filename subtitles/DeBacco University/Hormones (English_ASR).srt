1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,290
okay here we're gonna look at some very

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,990
specific classifications of hormones a

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,849
little bit more detail on how the

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,339
different classifications of these

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:14,129
hormones have different ways of entering

6
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,980
and affecting cells so starting first

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,539
hormones in general well hormone is a

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,580
chemical signal that's produced in one

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,220
part of the body and acts at a distinct

10
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,889
site there's three main invaders to the

11
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,689
body to using these chemical signals one

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,278
is it can spread to all tissues via the

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,778
blood so our blood goes which is

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,299
throughout the entire body these

15
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,429
hormones can travel in addition they can

16
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,828
persist much longer than our electrical

17
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:40,049
signals electrical signals for example

18
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,910
would be in our nervous system which

19
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:43,589
also causes effects all over the body

20
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,759
but for a very short period of time

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:51,329
hormones persist much longer in the body

22
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:53,218
they can act as mini axes hormones so

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,649
we're looking here these chemical

24
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,329
signals right there acting an example

25
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,698
would be as hormones which we're going

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,469
to investigate here now different

27
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,170
hormones can target different tissues

28
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,390
it's very important because what is

29
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,640
secreted into the bloodstream will only

30
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,400
affect target cells it's not gonna

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,650
affect all cells doesn't affect target

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,600
cells which I have the image here is

33
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,460
these hormones create a balance that

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,780
needs to occur also a lot of times

35
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,699
there's a lot of stresses on the body

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,989
and hormons need to maintain this

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,820
balance or homeostasis on a daily basis

38
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:30,089
now how this is occurring is hormones

39
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,859
need receptors so we see a signal we see

40
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,409
a receptor and we have an effect that

41
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:36,989
occurs for example here's a hormone

42
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,630
entering the cell this one molecules

43
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:41,938
causing this cascading effect which is

44
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,188
then resulting in a ribosome producing a

45
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:47,129
protein which is changing the cell's

46
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:49,679
function so one little hormone can cause

47
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,109
a bunch of different steps to occur that

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,009
ultimately in this case cha caused a

49
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:58,228
change in the cell function now there's

50
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,899
homology in hormones so what does this

51
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:03,359
tell you about the hormone prolactin so

52
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,299
we have prolactin yeah affects mammals

53
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,520
and birds and fish and amphibians it's

54
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,840
related to kind of a growth hormone so

55
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,870
how does this hormone produce different

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,870
effects it's the same hormone as we see

57
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,450
here that's

58
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,030
milk production with the animals for

59
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:21,878
birds it's Fatma taslim metabolism for

60
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,870
fish it's salt and water balance in TV

61
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:27,250
ins its metamorphosis and maturation

62
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,620
well this kind of leads us to believe

63
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,719
that this suggests that prolactin is an

64
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,480
ancient hormone whose functions have

65
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:37,239
diversified along with the evolution of

66
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,889
various vertebrate groups so we have

67
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,590
this kind of single hormone that

68
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:44,828
depending on what animal it is can

69
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,189
affect but I have different effects

70
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:50,650
within those particular species so it is

71
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:53,889
kind of a way that we're looking at kind

72
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,480
of one hormone that were consuming this

73
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:57,639
is particularly for the man-made

74
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:00,789
hormones how that might be produced for

75
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:03,479
one animal how can negatively impact or

76
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:06,128
have a different impact on other species

77
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,479
that continuing hormones target cells

78
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:09,518
well there steroid hormones are

79
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,199
manufactured from cholesterol the lipid

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,569
soluble and making cross the lipid

81
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,219
bilayer in the cell membrane they bind

82
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,869
receptors within a nucleus usually

83
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:19,709
hormone receptor complex that live in

84
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,090
cDNA causing changes in gene activity

85
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,979
then we also have anabolic steroids

86
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,500
which are synthetic compounds resembling

87
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:28,840
testosterone these cause muscle cells to

88
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,370
produce more protein so you have our

89
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,439
steroid hormones that are in a box

90
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,629
steroids which are synthetic man-made

91
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,878
compounds kind of that version here of

92
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:38,259
the Hulk

93
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,759
now classification of hormones we have

94
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,679
two major classifications

95
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,828
one is protein-based hormones that are

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,269
polypeptides small proteins

97
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,310
glycoproteins or large proteins with

98
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:51,009
carbohydrates and amines which are

99
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,449
modified amino acids then we have our

100
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,888
lipid side will based hormones which are

101
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,260
steroids and they're modified

102
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:57,879
cholesterol and so it's important again

103
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:59,590
it's still keep in mind of the

104
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:01,719
macromolecules and discover hydrates

105
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,389
lipids and proteins and their different

106
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,979
properties and these may have now

107
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:07,480
looking specific at lipid soluble

108
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,878
hormones to investigate them just a

109
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:12,039
little bit further here we see a lipid

110
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:13,568
soluble hormone in the right in the

111
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:16,598
blood cells here here's our red blood

112
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:19,149
cells it goes through the blood vessel

113
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:20,608
and we see the lipid side with hormones

114
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,079
diffuses through the plasma membrane

115
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,598
hormone binds with a receptor in the

116
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,729
cytoplasm forming this complex the

117
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:30,459
receptor hormone complex enters in

118
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,980
nucleus triggering gene transcription we

119
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:35,859
see here a change in the DNA and are

120
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:39,370
transcribed mRNA messenger RNA is

121
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:42,699
translated into proteins after the alter

122
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,490
cell activity so this single hormone

123
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,529
gets into the nucleus changes a gene

124
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,509
expression ultimately resulting on a

125
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:51,879
protein being made they can alter

126
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:53,500
cellular activity a steroid Homan

127
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:56,469
directly initiates production of

128
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,800
proteins within a target cell so we want

129
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,300
to compare lipid silyl hormones to some

130
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,490
of our other hormones

131
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,280
now steroid hormones are gonna fall

132
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,500
under this same category this might be a

133
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,059
little clearer to say because here we

134
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,670
have our steroid hormone directly

135
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,500
entering the cell creating complex going

136
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,689
into the nucleus binding the sites and

137
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,970
the chromatin activating mRNA

138
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:22,120
transcription resulting in the cellular

139
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,230
response these steroid hormones enter

140
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,750
through the cell membrane and bind

141
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,920
receptors inside the target cell these

142
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,050
hormones may directly stimulate

143
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,270
transcription of genes and make certain

144
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,189
proteins because terrence steroid

145
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:36,069
hormones work by targeting gene activity

146
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:37,839
the response is slower than the other

147
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,480
group were look at which is peptide

148
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:44,649
hormones so steroids follow the same

149
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,710
category as lipid soluble water-soluble

150
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:50,620
are a little different here so our water

151
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:55,089
Seibel hormone we notice here is binding

152
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:57,370
to a surface receptor so water Seibel

153
00:05:55,089 --> 00:06:00,279
hormones are membrane soluble they bind

154
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,410
them membrane receptors so if we look

155
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,639
back at the other one here there is no

156
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,230
membrane here I just kind of went right

157
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,329
through right to the nucleus these are

158
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:10,180
lipid soluble here we're focusing now on

159
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:13,209
water side they bind and activate what's

160
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,009
called the g-protein this then is then

161
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:17,680
causing it to then go through and enter

162
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:19,240
the cell so we're noticing we're not

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,879
directly going into the nucleus who are

164
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,350
binding to surface proteins because they

165
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,480
could not diffuse directly through the

166
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,580
cell membrane they're water soluble they

167
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,360
can't get by that phospholipid bilayer

168
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:33,729
these hormones must find a surface Selmy

169
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,920
membrane receptors before initiating a

170
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:38,319
cell signal as we see here so we're

171
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,420
still inactivated protein in the end but

172
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,699
it's a very different pathway than our

173
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,720
little bits

174
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,990
continuing on is peptide hormone

175
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,759
pathways we see that receptor binding

176
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,038
these peptide hormones these short

177
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,870
peptides or full-sized proteins they do

178
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,550
not enter the cell directly they bind to

179
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,310
receptors embedded in its cell membrane

180
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,379
as we see here when the hormone binds

181
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,050
receptor a secondary messenger molecule

182
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:03,370
initiates a cellular response you see

183
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,829
that here initially in this response

184
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,769
that then ultimately is going into the

185
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:11,800
nucleus and causing the initiation of

186
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:14,379
indirectly of secondary messengers this

187
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,470
signal transduction is this multiple

188
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:19,689
fold increase in our message being

189
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,250
received within the cell peptide

190
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,490
hormones are water-soluble and often

191
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,050
produce faster responses then the

192
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,850
benefits of this secondary messenger

193
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,280
system you have the signal that's

194
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,150
binding we have a receptor protein and

195
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,888
the key part here we have this

196
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:35,859
amplification steps that are occurring

197
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:38,530
so one single binding going through we

198
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,509
see these multiple implications then we

199
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:42,339
seen implication from that so from one

200
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:43,860
binding we generate one two three four

201
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:47,319
five six seven eight

202
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,270
cyclic EMPs here from those eight each

203
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,310
one of those can develop a protein

204
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,228
kinase which can produce a whole bunch

205
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,870
of enzymes which introduce a whole bunch

206
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:58,000
of product so this cascade multiplied

207
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,090
our response is also a very quick

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,709
response this is how we can produce the

209
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:05,579
body commuters very small amounts of

210
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:08,948
hormone and have a very large effect

211
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:11,829
that occurs or large response of product

212
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:14,080
within the body system so the benefits

213
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:16,209
of the secondary messenger system is the

214
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,098
implication that can occur in the large

215
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:21,069
amount of product that can be produced

216
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:23,288
from a very small or relatively small

217
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:26,759
amount of signal being produced

218
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:26,759
initially by the body
