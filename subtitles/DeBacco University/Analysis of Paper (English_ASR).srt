1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,198
here we're looking at the analysis of

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,798
paper

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,639
and some of the properties of paper

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,400
specifically how it can help us with

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,000
forensic science

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,440
so first off there's types of paper and

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,559
there's many types of papers so you

8
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,839
might be thinking of the paper you're

9
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,000
taking notes on

10
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,519
but there's inkjet paper there's blind

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
paper there's wax paper there's filter

12
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,559
paper

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,160
there's many different types so this

14
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,599
just shows you some of the variability

15
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,920
or the extreme variability

16
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
but even within for example inkjet paper

17
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,960
there is some variability

18
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,479
so the paper additives so paper have

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,920
things added to them

20
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,839
the seasons makes the surface of the

21
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,359
paper less porous to ink and this allows

22
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
handwriting and print to look sharp

23
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,719
and clear this can be something for

24
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,759
looking at a note we might notice

25
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,079
something like this

26
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,679
there's fillers added that add color

27
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,759
surface texture and durability

28
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,519
and there's coatings these coatings help

29
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,399
improve the look and surface properties

30
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
of the paper

31
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,160
coatings make the paper more suitable

32
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,039
for copiers printers or even normal

33
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,119
handwriting

34
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,559
the kind of the image that we see here

35
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,358
we can see those layers may not be

36
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,959
consistent

37
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,879
throughout some could be of various

38
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,680
thicknesses this can also play an

39
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,879
important role in identifying the paper

40
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,880
so i've been talking about paper well

41
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,560
what is it in general well pretty much

42
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,239
it's made of wooden cotton

43
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,560
and at least those are the most common

44
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,239
ingredients that make up today's paper

45
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,240
now the amount or the type can be a

46
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,000
little bit variable but those are the

47
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,280
general components

48
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,359
there's also common additives to paper

49
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
and these are chemicals that are affect

50
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,640
the color the occupancy the strength and

51
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,159
durability and brightness

52
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,280
and they are part of the paper producing

53
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,880
process things to consider

54
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
with paper looking at typically the

55
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,640
thickness is the first thing that you

56
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,599
may

57
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
notice uh thickness is measured

58
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,798
sometimes

59
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,799
in gsm or grams per square meter or a

60
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,720
caliper or referring to the thickness

61
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,399
in thousands of an inch and you'd use

62
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,000
calipers to measure that

63
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,719
you can see here greeting cards being

64
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,239
very thick and heavy in tissue paper

65
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,039
being on the other end of the spectrum

66
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,359
here being

67
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,840
a lot thinner in this form a lot lighter

68
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,599
in grams per square meter

69
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,040
the texture of the paper this plays a

70
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,478
big role when it's printing how it looks

71
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,439
when complete completed

72
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,159
it can be coated in uncoated textures

73
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,919
the coated

74
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,598
allows inks to kind of dry on the

75
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,839
surface where uncoated

76
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,799
those absorbed fibers get into the paper

77
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,479
into the

78
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,080
fibers that we can see here in a little

79
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,359
bit more of a detailed view

80
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,959
often this means the inks will appear

81
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
more vibrant and intense and coated

82
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,759
stocks

83
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,039
so this is just something to consider

84
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,239
when you're looking at the paper or if

85
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,878
you're looking at handwriting or

86
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,239
ink used on that paper then we also have

87
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:33,919
the brightness so the brightness you

88
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,560
could think of this as like the wattage

89
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,039
of a

90
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,120
light bulb brightness is the volume of

91
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,000
light reflected off the sheet of paper

92
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,680
it's a 0 to 100 scale it's a measurement

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
of reflectance of the blue which is

94
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,319
shorter wavelengths of the visual

95
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,439
spectrum at 450 nanometers what does

96
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,159
that translate to well

97
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,199
here's a paper of 100 brightness here's

98
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,199
one of 90.

99
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,919
you could see the 90 is a duller in

100
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,318
appearance than the 100.

101
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,439
there's also finishes that might be put

102
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,199
onto paper

103
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,639
so these are other things to consider we

104
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,799
have the

105
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,839
uncoated the matte the glossy and the uv

106
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,680
gloss paper's

107
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,120
finish this is referring to like the

108
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,760
sheen or how shiny

109
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,120
the paper is when it plays a role in the

110
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,919
readability and the look of what's

111
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,239
printed on

112
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,919
the page the difference between uncoated

113
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,080
matte and gloss is primarily the amount

114
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,679
of coating that is applied to the paper

115
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,360
we could see here these different types

116
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,519
shot under the same light you can see

117
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,599
clearly it being reflected the greatest

118
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,200
intensity with the uv gloss

119
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,839
and pretty much non-existent on the

120
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,560
uncoated and barely visible at all on

121
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,158
the mat

122
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,479
this just shows the kind of example of

123
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,719
the coating on how

124
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,639
that can impact the shininess to that

125
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,199
paper

126
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,559
we also have shades of white so the

127
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,560
paper what was it

128
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
on white paper well there is a bunch of

129
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
different types of white paper if you've

130
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
been to a paint store you know

131
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
uh the plethora of amount of options you

132
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,318
have under simply the color white

133
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,039
there's variations that include comment

134
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,759
like soft off white there's silk white

135
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,479
soft asparagus here um antique white

136
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,719
cause you have a

137
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,798
large variability here they're also

138
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,759
often considered part of the natural

139
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,840
color scheme

140
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,079
and are very common um types used for

141
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,238
paper

142
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,319
you also want to consider the occupancy

143
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,119
of the paper that you're that you're

144
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,358
looking at

145
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
a high occupancy and low occupancy high

146
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,319
economy is going to block a lot

147
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
and low occupancy you're going to be

148
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,000
able to see through it it's referring to

149
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,440
the degree of obstruction

150
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,839
of light that's expressed as a

151
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,800
percentage so for example something has

152
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,599
98

153
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,240
occupancy means that 98 of the light

154
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
cannot

155
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,519
pass through the paper low occupancy

156
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,599
means the paper will have

157
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,959
more show through so this is like can be

158
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
like a simple little light test look it

159
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,519
up under the of the light

160
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,679
and see how easy it is to see through

161
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,120
high occupancy is going to be like

162
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,639
business or card stock that's going to

163
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,360
be really thick

164
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,560
in dense paper and low occupancy as you

165
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,319
would hope it would have

166
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,079
would be like tracing paper something

167
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,360
very thin so you can see through it

168
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,279
last thing you want to consider in

169
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,600
certain papers is the potential for a

170
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,519
watermark which which is a unique image

171
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
