1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,000
in this debaco university video i'll go

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,399
over how to identify

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,200
male and female cannabis flowers both in

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,039
pictures

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,320
as well as take you out in the field to

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:16,390
do some identification

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:19,519
there as well

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,439
[Music]

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,640
here in this image we see a nice female

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,399
flower in this

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,320
video lecture we'll be going over how to

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,118
identify male and female cannabis

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,679
flowers

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,800
both in pictures as well as in the field

15
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,039
so first off those

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,558
important pre-flowers so when we're

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,119
looking at plants the first ones are

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:36,959
going to produce

19
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,799
are those little pre-flowers growers

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,399
should first look at the nodes or which

21
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,199
is the junctions between the leaves and

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,200
branches

23
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,920
and the stalks of the plant this is

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,359
where you're going to find those

25
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,679
pre-flowers to begin with

26
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,280
pre-flowers begin to develop four to six

27
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,960
weeks into the growing cycle

28
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
at the nodes and during this time

29
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,759
growers should be able to identify the

30
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,039
gender of the plant

31
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,159
as being male as we see here or females

32
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,559
we see down here

33
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,558
these immature flowers these are

34
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,158
immature flowers and will show the male

35
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,840
or female morphology

36
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,000
well before they're able to produce

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,359
viable components for seed production

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,680
so if you're identifying a male plant

39
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,478
here no problem no pollen is reproduced

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
or released

41
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,599
and a female plant here they're not

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
ready to kind of receive any sort of

43
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,919
pollen

44
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,759
removing the males at this time will

45
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,359
help ensure no chance of accidental

46
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,359
pollination will occur

47
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,400
male preflowers we simply want to be

48
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,959
looking for small

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,400
pollen sacs and for female pre-flowers

50
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,519
we want to be looking for two stigmas

51
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,759
which are typically

52
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,759
white in coloration these would be the

53
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,040
areas that would be receiving the pollen

54
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,879
these would be the areas would be

55
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
producing the pollen

56
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,759
now those female plants just focus on

57
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,560
those just a little bit more

58
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,118
specifically

59
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,240
right here well females are are the

60
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,359
plants that will produce the

61
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,679
cannabinoids and the greatest

62
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,680
concentrations within the flowers

63
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,720
if female plants receive pollen though

64
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,320
from male plants

65
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,478
seeds will be produced which will

66
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,438
drastically reduce the cannabinoid

67
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,280
production

68
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,879
cannabis is grown via cincimila which

69
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,118
stands for basically seedless

70
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,879
by removing male pollen producing plants

71
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,879
to prevent seed production

72
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,199
this allows the cannabis plant to focus

73
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,159
its energy on cannabinoid production

74
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
instead of seeds female plants will only

75
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,400
be

76
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,480
pollinated to produce seeds for breeding

77
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
purposes for the most part we want those

78
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,159
buds we can see right here female plant

79
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,559
to produce higher cannabinoids not seeds

80
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,840
so as we go over to male plants now for

81
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,360
comparison

82
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,039
male cannabis plants are grown for

83
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,160
pollen sacks instead of buds and are

84
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,479
often discarded

85
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,680
to avoid female plants from becoming

86
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,959
pollinated

87
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,360
male plants are important in the

88
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,479
breeding process pollinating

89
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,680
male plants shape rate of growth pest

90
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,518
and mold resistance

91
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
and climate resilience can be important

92
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,560
for breeding purposes

93
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
so knowing how the male plant performs

94
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,719
could offer some importance

95
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,160
for breeders because that will influence

96
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,639
the seeds or the following

97
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,039
generation male plants can also be used

98
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,039
for hemp and fiber in some cases

99
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,079
concentrate production but concentrate

100
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,919
is much less

101
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
than female plants and how we're going

102
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,518
to go about identifying those

103
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,800
well these are going to be our little

104
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,120
early pre-flowers

105
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
for male plants i've showed you some

106
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,759
great pictures

107
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,280
give you some great information now

108
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,919
let's take a second let's go in the

109
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,840
field

110
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:19,839
and compare both male and female flowers

111
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,440
here we see those brown pistols this is

112
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,400
an early indication

113
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,400
of a female pre-flower so it's important

114
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,039
to identify these early

115
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,959
male versus female plants and this one

116
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:47,840
will be a female and this will be kept

117
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:47,840
in the field

118
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,359
this is an attempt to show you the

119
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,840
stages of development here we have a

120
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
male

121
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,598
flower very early on in development

122
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,318
as we work our way down the stem here

123
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,238
you can see

124
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,359
further and further developed male

125
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,799
flowers

126
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
so again none of these have opened yet

127
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,319
so no threat to the field

128
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,239
but the earlier you can identify and the

129
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:19,519
earlier you can roll out these plants

130
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:22,160
the better as you can see the structures

131
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,959
of that male flower definitely here is

132
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
going to be where we're going to be

133
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,918
producing our pollen so this is what

134
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,639
defines it here

135
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,839
as male flowers see that these are the

136
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,478
most developed

137
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,679
we have some that not are quite that are

138
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,879
not quite as developed as

139
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,400
this moment in time located right here

140
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,000
uh this is definitely the time you want

141
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,319
to be able to clearly identify

142
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,918
them as male and he should be removed

143
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,439
from the field if you're looking

144
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,399
at producing higher cannabinoid and

145
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,519
terpene production

146
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,519
rather than seeds

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,240
so here you can see a very early male

148
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,719
pre-flower

149
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,400
it's located right here so i know it's a

150
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,080
little difficult to kind of

151
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,439
see there but the earlier you can

152
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,839
identify male

153
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,839
pre-flowers the earlier you can robe out

154
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,719
these male plants in the field

155
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,519
reducing any chance of pollination in

156
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,919
producing

157
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,240
seeds to get the maximum yield from your

158
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,240
buds

159
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
now if i work our way down a plant you

160
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,599
can clearly see

161
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,439
how those male flowers can really start

162
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,280
to stack up there

163
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,478
and this plant if not removed would have

164
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,439
produced a lot

165
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,839
of pollen that pond would not be wanted

166
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,000
in

167
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,839
this field you can see just the plethora

168
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,038
of male flowers and how they cluster and

169
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,519
develop

170
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,159
great look here at male pretty flowers

171
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,519
great look at

172
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,160
male pre-flowers here very early on

173
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,560
you can see as you work your way down

174
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,880
they do get a little bit more advanced

175
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,918
but trying to identify male plants is

176
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,079
important

177
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,478
to rogue those outside any cross

178
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:59,279
pollination

179
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:01,199
if you look down the plant in general

180
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,399
you just get an idea of this male plant

181
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,639
how much

182
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,000
flowers they can produce and how much

183
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,879
pollen it is possible for them

184
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,800
to release one plant left in the field

185
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,399
can really cause an issue

186
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,960
to all of your crops yeah to your entire

187
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,959
field here

188
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,120
that one male plant could easily

189
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,599
pollinate these thousands and thousands

190
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,600
of plants

191
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:31,120
or at least reduce the yield

192
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,120
of flower
