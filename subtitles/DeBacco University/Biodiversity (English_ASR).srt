1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:05,969
in this video we're gonna go over

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:08,460
biodiversity looking at the two midges

3
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:11,638
that I put here you can see here in the

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,980
wildflowers area on the off side of the

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,500
hay field a great amount of biodiversity

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,510
and in the hay field here a minimum

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,519
amount here a picture of bunch of

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,160
mushrooms indicating the biodiversity

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,969
that can occur in a relatively small

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,579
area so biodiversity is simply defined

11
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,768
as the variety of life in it in a

12
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:34,890
habitat you see the same two images here

13
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:36,689
we use two terms here species richness

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,299
and that's referring to the number of

15
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,308
species in an ecosystem this

16
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,078
biologically diverse ecosystems are

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:47,128
generally more stable than simple ones

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,620
these diverse areas allow different

19
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,179
species to be able to match the

20
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,948
particular conditions that may occur

21
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:56,000
will allow us life to continue to

22
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:58,799
survive its quality is usually measured

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,198
what we call this biodiversity how much

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:06,390
how many different species live in this

25
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:08,700
particular habitat two important factors

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,849
in promoting biodiversity one is

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,530
ecosystem size this may make sense in

28
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:16,109
the simple fact that the larger the

29
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,460
ecosystem contains more diverse habitats

30
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,340
and therefore as greater number of

31
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,589
species a reduction in the ecosystem

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,170
size will simply reduce the amount of

33
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,150
species that I can support can

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,159
ultimately lead to extinction may occur

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,920
in extreme cases if the ecosystem

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,680
shrinks too small here's an example a

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,900
picture of the world here with certain

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,150
amount of biomes defined as different

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,650
regions we're going to go over biomes in

40
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,090
a certain different section will be a

41
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,500
project related to those latitude is

42
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,079
another important factor when

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,849
determining our s'ti the number species

44
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,188
in the tropics is far more than the

45
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:54,959
Arctic regions simply because it's a

46
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:57,359
longer growing season plants can survive

47
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,669
longer plants are constantly growing

48
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,069
allowing animals to eat them and the

49
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,109
climate tends to be more stable so these

50
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,839
dark red regions represent greater

51
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,209
biodiversity and these deeper blues to

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,430
black regions represent less

53
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,319
biodiversity and you could see in

54
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,920
general towards the equator regions

55
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,829
there tends

56
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,179
more biodiversity than at either Pole

57
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,190
and this is simply because a longer

58
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,629
growing season more stable conditions

59
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:27,659
here specifically looking at what we

60
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,549
call island biodiversity this is where

61
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,039
we're getting an equilibrium model look

62
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,959
at isolated island look it's a species

63
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,719
written richness on an island it's

64
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,050
dynamic equilibrium between colonization

65
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,370
and rate of extinction see here we have

66
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,580
a bunch of different birds bunch of

67
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,890
different beaks various items that they

68
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,610
eat here's a generalist and said

69
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:52,589
catching we have him nectar-feeding

70
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:55,530
surface swimming filter feeders so on

71
00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:00,090
and so forth they also developed certain

72
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,590
niches to be able to survive hey two

73
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,599
important factors looking at Island

74
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,640
biodiversity the first one is island

75
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,979
size so here's our mainland here's our

76
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,539
radiating points outward the larger the

77
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,789
island in this case Island number two

78
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,500
will tend to have more species and

79
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:16,019
smaller ones and this should seem

80
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,310
logical if it's larger there should be

81
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:22,259
more out to have weird diversity greater

82
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,819
number of species can survive there

83
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:28,620
versus the small little island here

84
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,969
again distance from the mainland so in

85
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,579
this case we're going to call Island one

86
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:34,229
and two are basically the same size for

87
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,019
intents and purposes with the same

88
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:40,560
resources however the distance from the

89
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,900
mainland can impact this these that are

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,879
closer to the mainland will have greater

91
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,129
biodiversity than those further away and

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,319
this is simply like you don't want to

93
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,599
travel very far you're gonna jump to the

94
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,120
closest area before making a long

95
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,459
distance trip to this island I think's a

96
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,159
lot of energy to do that I tend to be

97
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,689
kind of a low close area if you're

98
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,599
parking in a parking lot and it picked

99
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:05,219
the closest spot very near you don't

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,400
want to go to these distant areas here

101
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,389
so that's going to tend to be less

102
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,209
biodiverse further away from that

103
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:14,578
mainland this again shows a little bit

104
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,870
of a craft indicating our number of

105
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,870
species

106
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:22,319
being far away I'm gonna have less

107
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,720
species then island closer to the manner

108
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,689
in near mainland this distance effect is

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,120
what that relates to farther away

110
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:32,339
less species near to the mainland more

111
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,829
species here looking at large and small

112
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:37,109
islands and the smaller island some

113
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:39,569
players less species and the larger

114
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,730
islands has more species putting that a

115
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:44,099
little bit different color here looking

116
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,410
to our island biodiversity summary same

117
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,230
thing here fewer species on small

118
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,630
distant islands and more species on

119
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,370
large nearby islands and again when we

120
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:57,120
say nearby islands nearby to the

121
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:59,819
mainland and this is on the x-axis here

122
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,889
increasing the species richness so these

123
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,990
many species and these are fewer species

124
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,329
and those on large islands close to

125
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,430
millions tune have greater biodiversity

126
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:10,669
than those smaller islands that are far

127
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,670
away
