00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,400
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,240
going to go over artificial lighting

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,600
options for cannabis production and give

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,000
you some of the pros

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,678
and cons of some of the common

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,920
artificial lighting sources that you

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,920
might be considering

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,480
[Music]

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,160
so if you ever wonder why there's so

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,118
many artificial lighting options well

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,399
there's some advantages and

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,719
disadvantages of each

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,559
which will be discussed here so first

14
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,600
off the goal of all grow lights

15
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,359
is to help plants grow that's the whole

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,719
idea or concept behind all the

17
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,280
artificial lights

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,879
there are different than typical room

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,759
lights because grow lights are based on

20
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,919
the spectrum

21
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,359
that is required by plants so just

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,200
because we see a nice

23
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,399
light that looks nice we want to make

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,399
sure it's

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
specifically designed for plants so it's

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,960
producing the spectrum and the

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,320
wavelengths that the plants need to

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,840
utilize

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,439
so provided with a good reference

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,719
article here looking at some artificial

31
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,878
lighting systems

32
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,640
all sources provided right here if you

33
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,039
want to look at it for yourself

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
in greater detail now looking at a

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
variety of grow light options

36
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,320
there are wide range of bulb types that

37
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,159
can be used as grow lights

38
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,679
however the general categories include

39
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,880
fluorescent lights which are typically

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,280
t5 lights

41
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,640
high intensity discharge lamps or hid

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,560
lights which include high pressure

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,400
sodiums and ceramic metal halides

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,000
and then light emitting diodes which are

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
your led lights

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,359
which would be getting very popular

47
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,319
recently so again this is just a nice

48
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,000
little comparison

49
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,839
looking at the spectrum the cost power

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,118
draw efficiency and applications

51
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,079
i'm going to go through here and provide

52
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:35,680
you with some advantages and

53
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,279
disadvantages of each

54
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,200
however before i get to the specifics of

55
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,680
the different types we want to look at

56
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,640
letting

57
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,640
technology continues to change so while

58
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,519
technology continues to kind of change

59
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,280
over time

60
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,039
the degree of light efficacy

61
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,040
advancements varies by the light

62
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,479
type led lights show the greatest

63
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,439
promise for continued future

64
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,920
improvements

65
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,639
we see a lot of leveling off in our many

66
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,478
of our other

67
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,718
lights such as the incandescents the

68
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,718
fluorescence the metal halides but we

69
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,839
see the led light group being definitely

70
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,519
one that is kind of

71
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,118
going against the general trend of

72
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,799
leveling off and this is kind of

73
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,080
exponential rise and here's where it's

74
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,080
estimated to kind of go to

75
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,879
going forward so that's just something

76
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,560
to take into consideration

77
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,239
now the distance between lights in the

78
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,680
plants so here we see just a little

79
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,959
example here of some

80
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
led lights and we kind of see a

81
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,920
measuring device here to kind of get an

82
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,840
idea how far that light

83
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,199
is away from the plants the distance

84
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
between the lights and the plants should

85
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,280
be based on the intensity of the light

86
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,120
this should be measured using a par p

87
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,360
pfd or pfd

88
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,800
meter there the lower light output the

89
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,319
closer the plants should be

90
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,840
and the higher the light output ideally

91
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,159
the further the plant should be

92
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
simply to avoid the chance of leaf burn

93
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,120
or damage

94
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,039
to maximize yields growers should keep

95
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,000
all plant factors such as water

96
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,239
concentration of carbon dioxide optimum

97
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,759
levels because cannabis can tolerate

98
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
high levels of light which can help

99
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,199
increase yields assuming all other

100
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,480
factors are not limiting

101
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,759
including but not limited to nutrients

102
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,598
so let's look at the first one here

103
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,120
looking at our fluorescent lights well

104
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:05,840
the advantages of fluorescence is that

105
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,680
can be close

106
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,439
placed really close to the plants

107
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,280
they're also not very expensive and the

108
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,959
bulbs have a very long life of about

109
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,800
twenty thousand hours

110
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,959
however the disadvantages are that they

111
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,680
have a low light intensity

112
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,199
they use multiple bulbs per unit and the

113
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
disposal of those bulbs can be a

114
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,759
challenge because of some of the toxic

115
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,640
metals

116
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,318
that they contain going on to cmh or

117
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,839
ceramic metal halide lights

118
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,000
the advantages of those are that they're

119
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
easy replacements for a for professional

120
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,199
light setup

121
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,200
one bulb design with more spectrum

122
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,919
options compared to the fluorescence

123
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,798
and they also have a long bulb life why

124
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,919
they're not used

125
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,239
is that they're not great for the

126
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,359
flowering phase they produce a fair

127
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,519
amount of heat

128
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,599
and also the disposal disposal of their

129
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599
bulb as well but it tends to be smaller

130
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,359
and tends to be less of them compared to

131
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,359
a fluorescent option

132
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,959
high pressure sodium lights can be used

133
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
for the entire growth season even though

134
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,640
it's not ideal for the vegetative stage

135
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,920
it still can be used prices have become

136
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,518
very attractive meaning they've been

137
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,280
reduced quite a bit

138
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,280
and it's considered to be the industry

139
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,280
standard so there's many reliable

140
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,560
options with the high pressure swim or

141
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,479
hbs lights

142
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,680
reason why some growers elect not to use

143
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,159
them is that their bulbs have a

144
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,799
relatively short life of only about 5000

145
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,799
hours

146
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,000
they do produce a fair amount of heat

147
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,358
and they have a limited

148
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
spectrum there so there's some

149
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,918
disadvantaged high pressure sodium

150
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,600
lights

151
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,519
lastly going onto led lights the light

152
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,479
emitting diodes they are full spectrum

153
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,159
light

154
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,478
and they can increase compounds that

155
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
define high quality cannabis

156
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,399
they also have a very long life of

157
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,000
typically 50 000 hours or greater

158
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,599
depending on the manufacturer

159
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,040
however the disadvantage of led lights

160
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,479
is the initial cost

161
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
there's a lot of variability currently

162
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,120
on the market and the total coverage

163
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,439
area per

164
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,199
light so when investing in any light you

165
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,918
want to make sure to do your research

166
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,560
look at everything extensively and make

167
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,799
the best

168
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,839
option that's a fit for your particular

169
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
growing situation
