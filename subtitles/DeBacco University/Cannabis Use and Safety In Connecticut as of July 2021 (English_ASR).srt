00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,200
all the information presented is based

21
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,399
of the canvas information provided by

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,879
the july 1 july 8 2021 time frame it's

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,799
only applicable for connecticut and is

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,359
subject to change at any time so please

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,919
check your local and current regulations

27
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,719
as this is intended for to be used as a

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,600
point in time

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,600
general example so questions that are

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,039
commonly asked is well one is

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,040
are there packaging or labeling

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,400
standards for cbd and legal delta

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,799
products within connecticut

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,920
and for products below 0.3 percent

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,640
percent dry weight

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,240
thc limit all federal and state laws

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,879
concerning labeling and packaging still

38
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,478
apply

39
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,560
to any food drug and dietary supplements

40
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,239
such as the connecticut food drug and

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,519
cosmetic ac states

42
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,079
and here we can see an example of a

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,478
label many other states this is the same

44
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,280
thing

45
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,118
labeling is very important so will

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,759
canvas products in the state regulated

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,359
market

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,118
be safe and this is looking at for the

49
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,359
state of connecticut

50
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,159
and this legalization imposes strong

51
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,640
requirements

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
for product safety products will have to

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,840
be lab tested

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,520
and will have strict packaging as well

55
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,240
as labeling standards

56
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,798
edible canvas products are limited to

57
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,719
five milligrams of thc per serving

58
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,799
and most other products are subject to a

59
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,560
potency cap as well

60
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
products will be in child safe packaging

61
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
and product types that appeal to

62
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,559
children

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,200
are banned and this is just an example

64
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,359
here of companies now producing

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
child safe packaging or something in

66
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,719
that form

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,319
different companies have different ideas

68
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,878
different packagings

69
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,919
but the goal here is to limit or make

70
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,280
them child

71
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,439
safe packaging so how does the law keep

72
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,680
our roads safe this is a very

73
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,359
common question asked by a lot of people

74
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,040
and while there is no test for cannabis

75
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,800
impairment like the breathalyzer that

76
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,439
police often use for alcohol

77
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
impairment can still be recognized via

78
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,359
driver behavior

79
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,799
on the road and through roadside

80
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
sobriety tests

81
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
the law steps up police training on

82
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,239
impaired driving

83
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
and also strengthens the impaired

84
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,519
driving laws which will help keep

85
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,159
drivers impaired by any drug

86
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,840
not just cannabis off the road drivers

87
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,439
who do not submit to a drug

88
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,598
influence evaluation from a police

89
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,759
officer trained as a drug record

90
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,359
recognization expert may have their

91
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,199
license suspended

92
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,000
details of that can go by state and

93
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,759
details of that would be within the law

94
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,519
so where can i use cannabis and the last

95
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,518
little question here is just well okay

96
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,120
where could i actually use it and this

97
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,599
comes down to contacting your

98
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,200
city or town for more information in

99
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,959
general you won't be able to smoke or

100
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,079
vape canvas anywhere you can't smoke or

101
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,200
vape tobacco

102
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,599
that's just kind of your general

103
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,518
guideline cities in townsville may enact

104
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,839
ordinances to regulate weather

105
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,640
uh and where cannabis can be consumed in

106
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,039
public

107
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,158
at home landlords may impose smoking and

108
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,840
vaping

109
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,598
i'm sorry may prohibit smoking and

110
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,799
vaping but they generally may not

111
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,878
prohibit the possession

112
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,480
or the consumption of either forms of

113
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,878
cannabis camus will

114
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,399
be also prohibited in state parks as

115
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,719
well as on state beaches

116
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,879
and waterways so again this is just

117
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,799
connecticut using this as an example

118
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,158
but this may give you some insight to

119
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,599
what one state's doing

120
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,239
because it may influence what other

121
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:53,438
states do so just keep this in mind

122
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,840
as far as the ever changing

123
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:59,519
and world of laws and regulations

124
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,519
centered around cannabis
