1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,220
okay here we're look at binomial

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,000
nomenclature and if you break these two

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:11,550
words down by meaning - Gnomeo referring

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,620
to name and nomenclature is this system

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,540
of naming you begin to make sense of

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,799
this what's is going to be all about and

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:22,019
how important this is for biology so

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,179
starting with in general names were

9
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,009
based on Latin or ancient Greek words

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,439
and scientists everywhere understood

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,210
these languages we want to use terms

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,899
that are interchangeable that's across

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,329
regions languages for naming our

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,340
organisms so that no matter where you

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,500
are located in the world where you may

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,120
be doing research scientists all over to

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,369
know exactly what you're referring to so

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,229
the first word of the scientific name is

19
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:52,049
a species name it's the name of the

20
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:54,390
genus to which the organism belongs to

21
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:56,339
the Jews name refers to the relatively

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,469
small group of organisms to which a

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,379
particular type of organism belongs

24
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,239
remember that from our classifications

25
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:06,509
in our kingdoms

26
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,280
file ohms and Families how this relates

27
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,710
we're looking specifically here at the

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,960
naming of the first word referring to

29
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,459
the genus the second word is the name of

30
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,158
the species and this is a specific

31
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,289
identifier species names are usually a

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,700
Latin description of some important

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,549
characteristics of that particular

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,890
organism humans here you see Homo

35
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,990
sapiens homos being the genus and

36
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,129
sapiens is referring to these species

37
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:34,019
plotting this - another example and

38
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:36,810
allowing how you'd understand some more

39
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:39,149
of the rules associated with this when

40
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,920
we use the Latin name for an organism we

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,079
always capitalized the genus which is

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,329
the first part but not the species

43
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,129
identifier which is the second part we

44
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,469
also print the name in italics or

45
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:51,149
underline them you use italics if you're

46
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:53,099
using the computer or if you're writing

47
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,649
them on a test quiz or any handwritten

48
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:58,048
who would underline them for example

49
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,420
Acer rubrum which is the scientific name

50
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,700
for a red maple tree so again the common

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,950
name would look like this if you were

52
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,290
writing it out if you were typing it you

53
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,810
would use the italics Acer is the Latin

54
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,420
name for maple that's again the genus in

55
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,080
rubber 'm is the latin word for red and

56
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,419
it's refer

57
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,350
to the species certain ones can also be

58
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:22,229
abbreviated as we can see here a period

59
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:26,180
and Romo referring to our beautiful

60
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:26,179
youth all at least red maple trees

61
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:32,069
humans are named Homo sapiens

62
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,140
so homo because of our large brained and

63
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,120
upright posture through that's derived

64
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:39,299
from any sapiens because our

65
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,189
intelligence and ability to speak if

66
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,870
you're a star Wars fan and qui-gon jinn

67
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,859
quote right here the ability to speak

68
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,930
does that make you necessarily

69
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,550
intelligent but we also said our large

70
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,610
brain and this gives you an example of

71
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,459
our cerebral cortex not with neurons

72
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,310
that we have in billions compared to a

73
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,670
couple other species here so you can see

74
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,560
the elephant monkey and the chimpanzee

75
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:04,349
we have sixteen point three billion

76
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:08,879
which is much larger than any of these

77
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:11,129
other different species how this might

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,250
look myself up here now this might look

79
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:17,759
is there's a lot of information that can

80
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,439
be conveyed in a very short space so

81
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,750
this is just one example of the Colorado

82
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,479
potato beetle which is actually a major

83
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,430
pest insect and it's here kingdom or

84
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,129
phylum our class and our order family

85
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:32,370
genus or species and all the numbers

86
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,229
correspond here so I see they're able to

87
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,349
determine what Kingdom it's in it's an

88
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:40,349
animal and then get very specific here's

89
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:42,930
a binomial name and that's referring to

90
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:45,659
again you'll notice it's in italics

91
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,000
because it is typed the first word is

92
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:51,239
capitalized there's a space and our

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,979
second word so our name and authority

94
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,200
and when it was potentially named who

95
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,060
named it all of this information can be

96
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,039
kept very quick and easy and it's kind

97
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,469
of like card like format with the

98
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,810
addition of a picture this can be very

99
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:06,509
helpful for looking at doing research or

100
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,239
trying to identify and talk about this

101
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:10,829
specific insect so that people all over

102
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,069
the world know exactly what we're

103
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:17,430
talking about so getting on how to

104
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:20,250
properly write binomial nomenclature so

105
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,108
here's an example of again humans this

106
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,350
one is incorrect because it's all

107
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,819
written as one solid word the second

108
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,100
example here is wrong

109
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:31,769
even though it's two separate words we

110
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,200
notice the first word here is not

111
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:35,939
capitalized the third version is

112
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,899
capitalized and does have a space but

113
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:39,750
because it's handwritten

114
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:42,449
is not underlined this last one here

115
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,759
indicates the correct improper way to

116
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,219
write binomial nomenclature first word

117
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,560
capitalized space to the second word the

118
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,540
second word is lowercase and both words

119
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,170
are underlined if we were typing this on

120
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,760
a computer we could italicize them

121
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,470
so looking at our taxonomy and

122
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,839
nomenclature they're closely aligned but

123
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,020
separate and complementing endeavors in

124
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,219
developing the language of biodiversity

125
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:08,069
nomenclature is a system for giving

126
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,960
names to organism organisms taxonomy is

127
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,389
the branch of biology that identifies

128
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,149
and names organisms so coming together

129
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,990
we get able to develop the type of

130
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:20,759
specimen so that we're able to

131
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,410
understand exactly what it is and we get

132
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,959
away from the use of common names even

133
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,150
though it might be easier to understand

134
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:29,939
certain species and different species

135
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:31,829
may have overlapping in common names so

136
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:36,120
this nomenclature taxonomy come together

137
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:38,039
as we were able to as scientists talk

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,180
about the same thing regardless of our

139
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,180
geographic location
