1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
as the title suggests this is gonna go

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,298
over the immune system basics the graph

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:07,919
here kind of gives you the very brief

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,109
overview we have an initial response

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,058
protective immunity and memory that

6
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:14,039
occurs keep in mind that memory can

7
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,858
occur over years and this is what makes

8
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,049
vaccines effective our initial exposure

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,750
will have a dramatic rise in antibody or

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,910
effector T cells I also provided links

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,099
here to two other YouTube videos you'll

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,820
also find the links to the slides and

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,589
references in a description below so

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,980
first off the immune system in general

15
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:37,109
looking at the human body the human body

16
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,569
is a wonderful place because it's safe

17
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,869
it's nutrient rich and it's temperature

18
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,340
and pH are optimized this is the fact

19
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,339
that your body is able to maintain

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,550
homeostasis to keep the cells nice and

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,379
protected this is quite an attractive to

22
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,718
other organisms that don't belong in the

23
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,149
body these are conditions which are very

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,129
difficult to find as a result we have

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,719
those organisms that want to get into

26
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:02,099
the body

27
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,689
many of these provide value may help

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,609
maintain the environment by breaking

29
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:07,670
down macromolecules that we can't such

30
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,629
as an example of some enzymes

31
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,549
synthesizing needed nutrients and

32
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:14,188
keeping harmful organisms in check

33
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,520
however not every organism is out to

34
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:20,758
benefit the body there are some bad

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,500
apples for example these bad apples want

36
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,180
to essentially compete for nutrients

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,099
overload the system with toxins take

38
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,860
over and destroy cell machinery and kill

39
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,719
body cells as a result we can have that

40
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,759
sick feeling and these are

41
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,739
disease-causing organisms that our body

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,810
must defend against physically such as

43
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,548
for example via our skin and with

44
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,189
biological means such as white blood

45
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,110
cells the supporting infrastructure

46
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,179
ought to the immune system is something

47
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,280
called the lymphatic system but not only

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,259
touch on that now I'm going to bring

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,149
that more in when we do circulatory

50
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,109
system because as you can see here it is

51
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,030
closely related

52
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,709
however the lymphatic system is a

53
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,030
central location for storage and

54
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,789
distribution of immune cells and

55
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,560
proteins if you're sick so we might say

56
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,659
oh my lymph nodes are swollen

57
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,990
that's a network of capillaries ducts

58
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,489
and nodes throughout our organist and

59
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,759
you can see that here how it does look

60
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,310
very similar to our circulatory system

61
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,799
now a pathogen so my

62
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,569
or tourism that can cause disease have

63
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,930
some examples of some pathogens here are

64
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:23,568
viruses bacteria fungi parasites but

65
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,909
it's important that can cause disease so

66
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:27,829
pathogen is only one third of the

67
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:30,349
necessary components that cause disease

68
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:33,080
we have a pathogen that needs the proper

69
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:35,599
host and needs the proper environment to

70
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,310
result in disease and often give the

71
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,500
examples in throat of focusing in humans

72
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,009
here certain pathogens that may affect

73
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,500
plants tobacco mosaic virus powdery

74
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,090
mildew are a pathogen that affect plants

75
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,550
so they need the proper host an

76
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,170
environment to cause disease that

77
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,610
pathogen exists in the air particularly

78
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:55,129
powdery mildew we've breezed those

79
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,110
spores in we're not the proper hosts

80
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,719
so therefore with disease is not caused

81
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,000
you need all three of these factors to

82
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:04,909
come into play the same time to result

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,620
in a disease what is the enemy look like

84
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,209
so what is our immune system protecting

85
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,769
us against well there's a wide range of

86
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,739
organisms that try to exploit our bodies

87
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:15,530
this is just a few examples keep in mind

88
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:18,500
there's cellular enemies it's parasites

89
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,060
and fungi but also a cellar or nonliving

90
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,879
one such as a virus

91
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,739
remember viruses DNA or RNA wrapped in a

92
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,900
protein coat and we have our

93
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,390
procure-to-pay for example our bacteria

94
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,610
so all of these can do our body harm as

95
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:34,639
a result in their immune system to be

96
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:37,400
able to handle all of these we have

97
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,439
different blood cell types so RBC again

98
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,289
stands for red blood cells now and we

99
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,539
refer them as erythrocytes there is an

100
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,030
example of them transporting oxygen we

101
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:48,798
talked about them we did a hypotonic

102
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,049
isotonic and hypertonic situations here

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,319
how they can swell up and in trouble and

104
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:56,599
then white blood cells WBC they're

105
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,250
called leukocytes and as you can see

106
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,108
here there's many different types of

107
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,359
white blood cells there's only one type

108
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:04,930
of red blood cell red blood cells have a

109
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,709
biconcave disc which are important for

110
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,950
increasing the surface area to volume

111
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:11,209
ratio elements of blood so red blood

112
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,219
cells white blood cells gonna be our

113
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,599
main focus I don't want you to forget

114
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,919
about we also have platelets in our

115
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:19,100
blood which we'll talk about when we do

116
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,538
the circulatory system white blood cells

117
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,400
are probably the most important part of

118
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:24,949
the immune system let's see here the

119
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,629
large table kind of discussing them and

120
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,459
see their importance here's our

121
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:29,750
overthrow sites and here's our platelets

122
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:31,219
there and you can pause the video and

123
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,930
take a look at those in greater detail

124
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,390
but we're gonna focus mainly with the

125
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,340
immune system the white blood cells so

126
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,560
some of those white blood cells this is

127
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:41,179
a great summary chart if you watch some

128
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,250
of the other immune system videos to

129
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,350
come back to this kind of events at a

130
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,079
nice cell type characteristics location

131
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,390
and in general image these are four main

132
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,579
types here and on the last slide here we

133
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,339
have the other four so again good slides

134
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:58,159
to come back to use as review to make

135
00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:00,319
sure you're able to identify some of the

136
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,530
different white blood cell types of the

137
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,529
immune system
