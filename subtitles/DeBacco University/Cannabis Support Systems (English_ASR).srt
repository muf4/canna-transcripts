1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,129
here we look at some different ways to

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:08,129
physically help support cannabis plants

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:10,019
and this could be is first very small

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,780
plants there are more commonly used on

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,879
large plants and here we see an outdoor

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,980
grow there's a lot of wind and other

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,990
environmental factors so here it becomes

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,028
even more advantageous that now there

9
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,788
are these support systems in place but

10
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:25,379
they're fairly strong and robust so

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,849
trellis netting is the first one we see

12
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,618
that kind of going back in that title

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,960
slide we see some horizontal and some

14
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,600
vertical Charles netting trellis netting

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,910
needs to be layered out ahead of time to

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,219
allow plants to grow through it this is

17
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:40,199
referring to kind of the more horizontal

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,210
approach a lot of miss plants to grow up

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,710
and through it should be supported well

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,450
so plants don't fall over and break

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,189
later in the growing cycle when the

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,890
upper plant yields increase in weight

23
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,479
this is something that initially because

24
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,609
it's very spaced in a lot of air can

25
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,140
come through it's just fine but as these

26
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,479
plants go through it and become heavy

27
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,969
laden with yield we want to make sure

28
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,000
that it is well established so you're

29
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,489
not jeopardizing your entire crop then

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,200
they're stakes easy to apply when and

31
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,540
where they're needed always good to have

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,030
a couple extra on hand if you use them

33
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,470
it should be cleaned in some way it's

34
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,879
kind of see at the end of the season

35
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:18,150
here where we're getting our harvest

36
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,609
seeing how the architecture of those

37
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,109
stakes looked and here's a earlier part

38
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:24,000
of the grow and we could see them being

39
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:25,679
tied up here and kind of helped support

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,769
those plants keeping the vertical

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,180
growing arrangement lastly there's cages

42
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:32,310
and they're best applied early in the

43
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,720
brine cycle okay now when you put the

44
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,000
plants in the ground soon after that

45
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,908
they can transmit disease if not clean

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,459
between uses if constructed of reusable

47
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,290
material such as these wire cages here

48
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,839
these trails ones both the horizontal

49
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,060
and the vertical typically are wrapped

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,250
up at the end season and discarded metal

51
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,409
cages are a great option just make sure

52
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,609
you're in some way cleaning them between

53
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,609
your growing seasons
