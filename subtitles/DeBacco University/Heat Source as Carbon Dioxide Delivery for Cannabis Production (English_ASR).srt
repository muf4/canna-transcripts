00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,120
in this debaco university video we'll be

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,519
investigating heat source

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:16,879
as a carbon dioxide delivery for

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:18,480
cannabis production

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,239
if you're looking for a way to add some

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,800
heat and carbon dioxide

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,879
this can be a great way to combine both

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,199
of these methods into one

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,799
so first off many times growers need to

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,840
heat their spaces

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,760
and a lot of times we're trying to

12
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,640
maintain that nice plant conditions a

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,039
lot of times

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,799
supplemental heat is needed so heating a

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,399
growing air with a heater that also

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,238
generates carbon dioxide

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,679
seems like an obvious choice and it can

18
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,599
be very beneficial

19
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,920
however growers need to realize that

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,200
when when the heater will actually be on

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,960
in a regular 24-hour day if the heat is

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
only needed during the dark or

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,799
night period the addition of carbon

24
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,519
dioxide will not provide the plants

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,038
with much benefit only when the lights

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,359
are on or the sun is out

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,520
will the plants actually utilize carbon

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,760
dioxide efficiently

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
so we have the fall winter spring area

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,280
as well so in colder regions there may

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,000
be the need to heat

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,760
a grow space during light hours which

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
may only be during the cool

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,320
to cold seasons of the year this will

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,159
cause a slight unevenness in growth

36
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,199
related to the amount of carbon dioxide

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
enrichment

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,478
but when heat is needed anyway it can be

39
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,239
a worthwhile

40
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,840
addition so it may not be something

41
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,478
you're adding in the summer time because

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,719
it might be

43
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,920
adding cooling systems but this could be

44
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,920
a way to help benefit

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,240
during the colder months with adding

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,159
some carbon dioxide at least

47
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,000
now we have also the springtime push so

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,280
to get seedlings or clones off to a

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,759
quick and early start

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,320
this method of carbon dioxide generation

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,359
seems logical due to the typical need

52
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,919
for additional heat

53
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,680
anyway during this stage while this may

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,478
not be continued for the remainder of

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
the season

56
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,319
it can be a great way to give plants a

57
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,759
push early when fertilizers are

58
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,319
typically kept at a minimum

59
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,920
to avoid damaging of the small seedlings

60
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,438
or the small clones

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,118
supplementing that area with carbon

62
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,000
dioxide typically it's going to be

63
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,080
cooler anyway

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,159
it can be a great way to boost growth

65
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,160
with minimizing potential damage

66
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,079
to the plants and again the springtime

67
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,000
especially typically heat is needed

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,239
so why not use a heat source that will

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,159
also provide some additional benefit

70
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,039
by enriching your area with carbon

71
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,039
dioxide
