1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
so when many people hear cannabis in the

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:04,879
production of cannabis they're thinking

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,040
about the plant

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,439
and needing to be a botanist or a

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,120
breeder however we can't forget about

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,359
the fact that getting into

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,798
cannabis and some of the cannabinoids as

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,519
well some of the fertilizer

9
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,079
regimens the importance of having a

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,839
chemist

11
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,079
involved in the production of cannabis

12
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,118
plants so in this debaco university

13
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,799
video we're going to get into the

14
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:26,800
importance of a cannabis

15
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,840
chemist

16
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,280
[Music]

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,880
so if you're considering getting into

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,079
the cannabis industry and you're

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,079
interested in chemistry

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,759
there may be a job for you let's take a

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,520
look at some of those aspects

22
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,599
so first off the job description well

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,000
chemistry scientist is responsible

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,600
for devising creating and implementing

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,238
new product formulations

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,840
as well as manufacturing chemists find

27
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,439
ways to increase the efficiency of the

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,320
extraction methods used

29
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,320
within the laboratory they send test

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,759
samples to third-party companies and use

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,319
the information from them

32
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,039
to further improve upon the system in

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,719
use

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,320
so the chemist of that is trying to

35
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,478
extract those certain cannabis try to

36
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,719
understand how those molecules behave

37
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,159
to be able to increase the overall

38
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,519
efficiency of the extraction

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,680
process now the day-to-day activities of

40
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,599
a chemist looking uh that is

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
specializing the cannabis industry

42
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,879
you want to optimize the recovery of all

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,560
extractions

44
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,000
optimize the speed of the restraint

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,118
extractions as well

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,040
if you can produce the same thing in

47
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,000
shorter period of time well that allows

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,600
for increased efficiency and your

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,599
responsibility is to oversee the

50
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,118
efficiency as well as the purification

51
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,798
of the processes

52
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,040
now it's responsible for the production

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
of new formulations as well

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,920
they coordinate with third-party

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,640
laboratories to send them samples and

56
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,359
get those

57
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,478
results back they maintain strict levels

58
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,118
of accuracy

59
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,879
and they interpret testing results they

60
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,399
track records inventories product

61
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,519
related supplies as well it's very

62
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,960
important to keep track of

63
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,478
that and document all of these processes

64
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,078
and they follow appropriate regulations

65
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,438
which might be changing and updating so

66
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,478
it's important for them to stay current

67
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,318
with those

68
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,080
and they're responsible for laboratory

69
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,399
functions as well as

70
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,599
production now qualities if you're

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,200
considering to

72
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,799
pursue this job would mean you're going

73
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,919
to need to have some of these basic

74
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
qualities

75
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,519
knowledge in the operations of rotary

76
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,520
evaporator spray dryer

77
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,280
fluid extractor as other cannabis

78
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,280
related lab equipment

79
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,080
particularly involved in the extraction

80
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,080
process standardization and

81
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
calibration of the analytical equipment

82
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,800
as well is very important

83
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
because you want to make sure you're

84
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,599
getting accurate results you must have a

85
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,120
science

86
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,199
degree as well as some laboratory

87
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,959
experience typically must be at least 21

88
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,799
years old and willingness to

89
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,920
participate with others because often

90
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
you're working in a cooperative

91
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,280
environment of a lab

92
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
now what's the connection to the chemist

93
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,800
industry specifically at least

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,959
uh cannabis chemists are constantly

95
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,640
discovering new methods of extraction

96
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,239
as well as products and information

97
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,878
about how the brain and cannabinoids

98
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,360
work

99
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,359
they can work closely with kind of other

100
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,959
research scientists taking an extract

101
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
and seeing how it performs in other

102
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,680
situations

103
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
many of the methods used today for

104
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,879
extraction were devised by chemists in

105
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,199
the laboratory setting

106
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,280
well prior to the domestication of

107
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,958
cannabis for medicinal purposes

108
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,560
and have since been adapted to use in

109
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,080
the cannabis industry

110
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,920
then these chemists are taking the next

111
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,239
step further and refining

112
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,158
that process so if this is of interest

113
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,039
to you you may want to consider

114
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,039
to be a cannabis chemist
