1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,480
okay here we're gonna state-controlled

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:05,969
indoor environments for cannabis

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,200
production so his indoor environments I

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:09,539
have some pictures here some like

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,750
sterilized lab conditions while it may

6
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:15,660
not necessarily be this extreme in some

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,759
cases this is advantageous to reduce the

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,079
chance for disease see the advantage of

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,330
being an indoor environment you can

10
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,459
control a lot of factors you can also

11
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,739
pack plants in but with this if these

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,769
conditions are unclean disease can

13
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,989
spread very rapidly through that area so

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,570
controlled indoor environment generally

15
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,850
has no natural sunlight it's kind of a

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,500
seal kind of growth chamber it can be

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,809
computer-controlled I monitored

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,488
especially for larger operations needs

19
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:42,929
to have good air circulation so anything

20
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,299
about this room and wanna think about it

21
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,460
completely sealed up there needs to be a

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,558
good air circulation that does occur

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,780
also typically when we're adding air

24
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,549
circulation humidity can become a factor

25
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,198
should be monitored not getting too low

26
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,698
or too high to pay what environment

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,689
you're in typically they're good

28
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,659
candidates for adding supplemental

29
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:03,209
carbon dioxide because they're sealed

30
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,219
because there are so many controls this

31
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,618
is why adding this extra steps is

32
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:09,450
sometimes deemed to be worth it and

33
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:12,569
documentation and cleanliness is very

34
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,890
important so in terms basics the grow

35
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,289
room can basically cost as much as you

36
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,728
want to spend at the example here you

37
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,310
know I can go very cheap or you know

38
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:22,289
really expensive however quality plant

39
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,850
material the lights that you choose to

40
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,280
grow if there's especially if there's no

41
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,069
access to outdoor Sun and the growing

42
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,540
media should be the top priority so what

43
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,429
should you spend your money on well

44
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,710
these are kind of the three main things

45
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,600
the good quality plants to have good

46
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,158
supplemental lights for them and a good

47
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,478
media this is where you should be

48
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,969
spending your money first and then

49
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,500
adding in some other things from that in

50
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,179
general the room should have that

51
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,219
cooling this again is a priority and

52
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,680
that's consistent cleanliness throughout

53
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,989
the entire grow good air circulation

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,909
both inside and outside ventilation

55
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:56,009
reflective wall so you're maximizing

56
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,990
your lights that hopefully are off high

57
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,700
quality temperature control so things

58
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:02,459
aren't getting out of whack and carbon

59
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,939
filter to eliminate odors especially if

60
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:08,098
neighbors are a concern on a small scale

61
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:09,868
to his harvest should be a priority so

62
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,449
I've had one room that changes lights

63
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,830
and conditions with a planting will

64
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:16,409
limit your total harvest

65
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,480
once every four months or so so girls

66
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,560
always have rooms in different stages so

67
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,549
you're kind of getting into this

68
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,289
continual harvest of plant material not

69
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,810
going into like boom and bust springing

70
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:29,639
all flowers and then all veg and then

71
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,819
all clones and repeating that cycle

72
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,769
always having some in different stages

73
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:36,539
in this small scale multiple rooms are

74
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,060
tensile I too have one dedicated to

75
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,949
clone and propagation one vegetative

76
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,240
growth and one flowering the same

77
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:43,949
concept is used for a larger group

78
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,270
facilities as they use large rooms

79
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:47,429
dedicated for each of the three

80
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,780
distinctive properties so think of it

81
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,580
like in your house you want to have you

82
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,669
know a baby's room that's kind of your

83
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,170
clothing in your propagation room

84
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:56,250
vegetative room that's kind of where

85
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:58,439
you're looking at growing and expanding

86
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,520
and then flowering which is considered

87
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,229
like the Millennium I'm worthy you know

88
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,510
all the work is really done is that

89
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:06,479
plant goes into flower producers those

90
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:08,310
very useful cannabinoids lights

91
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,780
determine the gross space so a three

92
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,599
foot by three foot area can effectively

93
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,310
be lit by a 400 watt high intensity

94
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,310
discharge light typically abbreviated

95
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,620
hid and a five by five area requires

96
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,449
though a thousand watt HID light so the

97
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,310
type of light or sizer to use even since

98
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:25,560
they give either pro a thousand de it's

99
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,989
a double-ended bulb this could light a

100
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,640
five by five very very effectively but

101
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,980
there's other lighting options this is

102
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,559
just an example regardless of the number

103
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,729
of lights can dictate the total square

104
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,469
foot of row in space

105
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:39,419
so just because you have an area to grow

106
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,370
in if you can't effectively light it you

107
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,349
start to push the styles and want to do

108
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,239
a seven by seven foot area well it's

109
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,250
just not going to be as effective five

110
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,590
by five is the kind of the recommended

111
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,979
maybe pushing it to six by six but much

112
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,659
more than that is not recommended

113
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:56,699
estimated yield will tolex expected

114
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:00,270
grams per watt after about two months of

115
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:02,159
flowering minimal target is about 0.5 to

116
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,110
1 gram per watt example if you're

117
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,569
running a 600 watt light bulb it should

118
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,760
produce about 360 grams of dried buds

119
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,949
this just gives you kind of an idea of

120
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:12,109
what that error should be using and if

121
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,219
you're using it effectively

122
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,019
air circulation as I mentioned is very

123
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:17,970
important having stands to move air

124
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,259
within the grow space keep in mind

125
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,690
exchanging air from the outside

126
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,728
environment it's also necessary adding a

127
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:25,620
carbon fifth filters we see here to

128
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:27,419
reduce odors is highly recommended so

129
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,340
here air is being drawn through the car

130
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,830
unfilter taking out the odors coming

131
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,509
through the duck tank cooling this light

132
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:35,490
that's producing a lot of heat and then

133
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:37,259
going in venting out this is a small

134
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,230
grow tent operation but this same

135
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,180
concept can be scaled up the ceiling

136
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,680
height is a definite consideration you

137
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,560
want a minimum without five feet height

138
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,509
is considered a space needed for the

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,730
container of plant that's growing in the

140
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,870
space for the light to end too late you

141
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,819
don't want to cram it too short

142
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,769
especially with the high discharge

143
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,779
lights minimum is usually about five

144
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:59,729
feet eight or nine foot ceilings are

145
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:03,859
ideal wherever possible to give you just

146
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:05,939
more air more availability for cooling

147
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,020
walls of mirrors are not a good idea

148
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,879
this is kind of a misconception

149
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,229
especially in small rooms but want to

150
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,800
reflect the light so I think I should

151
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:15,450
just put a mirror well these mirrors

152
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,829
current create hot spots they're not the

153
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,469
best choice since they create hot spots

154
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:21,659
and do not scatter the light well should

155
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,730
be white or have some type of mylar this

156
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,320
is an example that mylar but this

157
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,480
reflective material does is will

158
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,889
increase the lights used efficiency and

159
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,340
eliminate the amount of wasted light

160
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,990
that is you're basically paying for and

161
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:36,389
this can help disperse that evenly

162
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,639
through the canopy make sure most of the

163
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,409
plant is getting a light even some of

164
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,909
the lower leaves again if you hang

165
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,880
mirrors to promise you get that one kind

166
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,290
of bright not a hot spot there and that

167
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,699
can kind of increase the chance of

168
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,640
burning or damaging a portion of the

169
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,889
plant mylar is a great material tools of

170
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,829
the trade so it's also important have

171
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:57,389
good just general tools pruning tools of

172
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:00,539
course for the plants but also just

173
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:02,579
general tools looking at the setting up

174
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,280
of the process or maintenance of your

175
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:07,769
room or a small operation even large

176
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,229
operations having that toolboxes

177
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:12,359
properly find fix and make adjustments

178
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,560
as needed just kind of an odd set of

179
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,240
tools but having it all so well

180
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,730
organized and know where it is you can

181
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,410
easily find it test and monitor before

182
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,569
installing the plants to run all systems

183
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,189
if there's any plans I'm sure everything

184
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,019
is fully operational for at least two

185
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:27,569
days this is important to the monitor

186
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:29,819
heat of a mid max thermometer here just

187
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,439
to try to monitor heat sometimes turning

188
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,029
the lights on me to go to law works I'm

189
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,240
gonna save power and then you go to put

190
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:37,109
the plants in and you overheat the area

191
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,509
adding some water to make sure all

192
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,129
electric systems are safely installed no

193
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:42,539
circuits are also overloaded

194
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,860
and to make sure if the heaters coming

195
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,530
out our cooling systems coming on the

196
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,850
trout overloading the circuit also light

197
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,619
leaks if you're in small operations

198
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,840
you're not getting that messing up a

199
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,040
photo period as I mentioned temperature

200
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,719
regulation is another important thing to

201
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,720
watch you know shock or kill your price

202
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,910
graph lastly a location Location

203
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,980
Location for both small in a large rooms

204
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,020
location is everything small rooms D

205
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,900
consider proximity to electrical outlets

206
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,639
also for air exchange large operations

207
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,870
need to consider the flour room size and

208
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,089
dynamics as well as the ability have

209
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,209
both propagation in a drying room to

210
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:17,579
allow for that continual harvest so here

211
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,959
we have outdoor locations there's the

212
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,479
last part they need to give severity

213
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,159
environmental factors that may occur so

214
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,840
all of these no matter what site you're

215
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,150
growing in you should be very familiar

216
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,949
with your general location so that

217
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:31,349
you're able to maximize it but not

218
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:34,339
overload it and end up throwing plants

219
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,340
out that you didn't plan for
