1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,000
now looking at plant temperature certain

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,560
plants are going to have different

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,230
preferences for different temperatures

4
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,768
for the most part most plants like

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,269
consistent conditions within a range

6
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:14,359
typically plants can be there too cold

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,740
will slow down their metabolic rate and

8
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:18,689
plants have that ideal temperature but

9
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,358
even it can get too hot for plants that

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,550
even live in tropical environments so

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,618
hover is better to a point and I stress

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,689
this because photosynthesis is most

13
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,460
efficient at about 85 degrees Fahrenheit

14
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,159
this is about 30 degrees Celsius under

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,480
normal carbon dioxide levels so this

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,459
should be the maximum temperature

17
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,529
obtained under normal growing conditions

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,390
so here we have net photosynthesis here

19
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,489
we have temperature we could see it

20
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,530
increases to a point but then as a

21
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:46,259
temperature increases the actual net

22
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,520
photosynthesis will decrease so it's

23
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,009
important to try to stay as close to

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,800
this range as possible to maximize the

25
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:55,948
plaintiff ition see the reason i say at

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,419
normal co2 levels myself up here is that

27
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:00,058
when you when the growth space is

28
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,859
enriched with co2 the theoretical

29
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,259
maximum temperature increases by as much

30
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,840
as 10 degrees Fahrenheit to almost 95

31
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,180
degrees Fahrenheit or from 28 degrees

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,228
Celsius to about that 35 or so degrees

33
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,420
Celsius this is because of plants able

34
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:17,099
to kind of take in that carbon more

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,900
effectively able to not open their

36
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,959
stomata as much there's a variety of

37
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,600
factors but under increased co2 levels

38
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,849
the plants typically can handle and

39
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,919
prefer warmer temperatures and you'll

40
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:30,929
see a net rise in photosynthetic rate

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,269
but even then after a certain point

42
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,290
there will be a reduction in the net

43
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:35,908
photosynthesis

44
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,700
even in enriched carbon dioxide

45
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,979
environments so the minimum temperature

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,450
target always keep your plants above

47
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:45,299
degrees Fahrenheit to help avoid

48
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,520
stunting below 55 degrees plant matasso

49
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,470
mows down dramatically if plants

50
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,989
experience 32 degrees Fahrenheit or

51
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,390
lower they will freeze and burn causing

52
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:55,739
them to die even if we have 235 that's

53
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,599
really gonna potentially do some damage

54
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,908
and definitely 32 and below will

55
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,199
basically kill other plants there so

56
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,149
you've met all plants how they're kind

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,118
of optimum range that they want it to be

58
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,310
at so in for canvas were typically

59
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,929
looking at that little maintaining right

60
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,628
around that seventy five ish degrees

61
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,870
Fahrenheit temperature consistency is

62
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:15,399
another great thing the goals

63
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,650
maintain the temperature and a grow

64
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,580
space within the close range

65
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,069
fluctuations can lead to stress and

66
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,569
reduced growth so it's because the

67
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:23,979
midday temperatures just fine

68
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:26,348
want to make sure it's fairly consistent

69
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:28,030
through the entire day at the metronome

70
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:30,369
here that consistency data back and

71
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,930
forth kind of regulating that nighttime

72
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,400
temp to that date I'm template we can

73
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,840
see the extreme conditions here where

74
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,420
it's nice warm in the greenhouse and

75
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,519
there is snow outside so it's important

76
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:42,219
to maintain those consistent conditions

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,989
to keep growth as efficient as possible

78
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:46,919
those day/night through the entire

79
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,920
growth season
