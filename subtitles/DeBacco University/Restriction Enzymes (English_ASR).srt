1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:03,149
here we're going to be looking at

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,519
restriction enzymes

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,679
now enzymes as you may remember from our

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,689
previous units can break something apart

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,279
or put something together in this case

6
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,070
they're going to be separating something

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,469
and that something is DNA going to be

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,198
breaking apart nucleotides at very

9
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,750
specific sequences this is a restriction

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,118
enzyme doing mass so restriction enzymes

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,789
they bind to specific short sequences

12
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,730
only four to six bases long in the DNA

13
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,850
sequence and the nucleotide sequence

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,920
what's interesting in both DNA strands

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,950
is identical when read in opposite

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,050
directions so you can see here

17
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:45,120
g-a-a-t-t-c well we read it in this

18
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:47,429
direction G a TTC read the same in AI in

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,128
opposite directions there's different

20
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:52,259
restriction enzymes and they basically

21
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,599
look for different recognition sites

22
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,369
that they're gonna cut the DNA example

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,649
here we have our DNA our Hindi 3

24
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,968
restriction enzyme cutting it right here

25
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,530
resulting in two sections now of DNA

26
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:07,890
this is another example here for the eco

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,710
r1 restriction enzyme most restriction

28
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,799
enzymes DNA is staggered fashion this

29
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,629
causes of generates sticky ends what

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,130
this term sticky ends mazes they want to

31
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:19,560
kind of rejoin together they want to

32
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,688
rebind they want to be kind of left

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,850
hanging out there these ends pair with

34
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:26,339
any other DNA fragment and generate some

35
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,469
of the same enzymes when we're pairing

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,540
it together

37
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:32,789
DNA ligase again comes back and that is

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,329
what's linking our DNA together to form

39
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,280
our double-stranded back again sticky

40
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,048
ends versus blunt ends so sticky ends

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,840
have sections that overlap and have

42
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,220
bases attached which results in the

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,380
likelihood they will rejoin with

44
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,609
complementary base pairs so again think

45
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,899
about here this little green line if we

46
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,118
separated out here

47
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,710
my name is called sticky ends this ends

48
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,019
gonna kind of want to stick back to this

49
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,419
end contrary to that we call something

50
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,670
called blunt ends and these have limited

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,159
contact in the direct cuts just cutting

52
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,680
the DNA right here in this sequence here

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,200
these sticky ends a little bit more of

54
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,580
an area where we could be binding blunt

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,439
end they're just going to be like this

56
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,390
kind of an overview join it's a little

57
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:15,639
bit harder than or rejoin we're here

58
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,989
chickens have a larger area that wants

59
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:20,919
to bind and that's what's causing the

60
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:22,870
sticky part restriction enzymes are

61
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:25,449
specific this is an important fact here

62
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,969
if there's a change in just one of the

63
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:30,549
base pairs of an eco r1 site and again

64
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,620
it's just a restriction enzyme the codon

65
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,920
will be changed this can result in the

66
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,379
loss of a cut site along the DNA meaning

67
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:41,019
this eco r1 these four to six ish basis

68
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:43,150
depending on what restriction enzyme

69
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,670
we're looking at they are looking for a

70
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,989
very specific sequence if you don't get

71
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:50,019
that very specific sequence you get a

72
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:51,969
mutation in one of those you may lose a

73
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,310
cut site or generate a cut site in

74
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:55,959
somewhere else along the DNA strand so

75
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,530
this is where you do not want to have a

76
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,719
mutation occur restriction enzymes what

77
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,759
they're actually used for I mean they

78
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,370
defend against infectious agents like

79
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,139
viruses and limbs that cleaver cut up

80
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,629
teen air important.if

81
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:12,609
foreign DNA gets put into a Cell give

82
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:14,169
our bacterial genome or a viral genome

83
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,269
here being injected into the cell if the

84
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:18,488
virus well cells naturally generate

85
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:20,829
these restriction enzymes to go through

86
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:23,049
recognize it says off foreign DNA and

87
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,390
chop it up before it can reroute all the

88
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:27,430
machinery of that cell this is why it's

89
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:28,779
important to have these we're going to

90
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,420
talk about them in relation to how

91
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,949
they're used for biotechnology but they

92
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,139
are in the natural sense they're not

93
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:39,179
completely man-made and they are used to

94
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:41,199
chop up what would be invading DNA

95
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,400
examples of restriction enzymes you

96
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,530
don't have to memorize these are just

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,739
some ones that are very commonly used

98
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:50,739
with where they come from eco r1 in

99
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,989
hindi 3 and our very common I've used

100
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,610
those in the lab this is just these

101
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,200
specific sequences that they look for

102
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,760
can remember our five-prime and

103
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,159
three-prime regions we talked about DNA

104
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,659
this is orient yourself in the DNA and

105
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,870
they each have a very specific

106
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:06,639
recognition recognition sequence which

107
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,900
will be important for a where it's

108
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,899
specifically going to cut
