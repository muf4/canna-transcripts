1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,678
all right in this debacle university

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,278
video we're going to be

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,759
looking at questions to ask when

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,679
selecting a cannabis strain to grow

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,679
there's a lot of options out there

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,280
there's many different types

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,880
but what are some questions you could

8
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,480
should be asking yourself

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
as far as knowing your conditions

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
knowing your environment to be able to

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,439
try to select a strain

12
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,879
that will grow well in your area so

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
let's get into some of the questions to

14
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,239
consider

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
now some of them be looking at one of

16
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,000
the first steps to determine is the area

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,399
you will be growing in

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
how large is it or how many plants so

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,840
this might play into the number of

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,600
varieties you might be choosing

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
uh the height of the plants you know how

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,160
large how many if you're doing any

23
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,159
trials

24
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,519
questions to really list realistically

25
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,919
take a look at

26
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,960
then you also want to have an idea if

27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,440
what your goal

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
end product will be can also influence

29
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,238
your selection

30
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,640
meaning are you looking at the very end

31
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,198
to produce quality dry flour or will

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,759
your

33
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,439
end product be going for extraction that

34
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,878
may play into the

35
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,878
type of flower that you're looking at

36
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,719
producing whether it's going to be kind

37
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,680
of a flower that's going to be visually

38
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,599
appealing

39
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,118
in large maybe or maybe a lot of small

40
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,798
flowers that are ultimately going to go

41
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,760
to extraction because no one's actually

42
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
going to see

43
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,320
the actual plant material at the end

44
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,640
then the plant morphologies this is

45
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,639
an important consideration because when

46
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,560
you're considering your area

47
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,079
you also want to consider the plant

48
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,240
morphology should be considered

49
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,078
remember the plant morphology is asking

50
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,640
questions like how tall will the plant

51
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,279
get

52
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,519
will it need frequent pruning does it

53
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,159
take a long time to grow when

54
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,679
does it produce the maximum flower

55
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,280
production how long should i let it go

56
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,799
how long after i flip it into a

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,920
flowering photo period

58
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,680
will it be expected to expand to have a

59
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,680
tendency to produce fewer buds but

60
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,079
larger buds more buds and smaller

61
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,520
may that affect my pruning strategy so

62
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,719
again all of these

63
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,718
ideas need to be taken into

64
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,078
consideration this is just the basic

65
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,359
morphology or structure of the plant

66
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,519
then it's also considering your

67
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,879
environment are you not height

68
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,798
limited you know can the plants get

69
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,399
however tall that they

70
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,080
that they can you know is there a

71
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,520
ceiling it's going to limit a grow tent

72
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
potentially to limit that

73
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
so if you're not ceiling height limited

74
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,799
this could lead to the selection of more

75
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
sativa dominant strains because they

76
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
have a tendency to stretch more

77
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,760
however just because you have the height

78
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,439
and particularly an outdoor situation

79
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,120
doesn't mean you need to you'd

80
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,560
necessarily utilize it

81
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,640
if you're growing outdoors tall plants

82
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,878
may be subject to late season wind storm

83
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,559
damage that's an important consideration

84
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,639
also more plant material may increase

85
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
the need for pruning which may increase

86
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,719
your expenses in both

87
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,239
labor and time so again just because

88
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,000
you're not height limited does not mean

89
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,519
you automatically select

90
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,080
the largest tallest growing plant

91
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,319
now just obvious consideration is are

92
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,160
going to be growing indoors or are you

93
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,479
going to be growing outdoors

94
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,680
so looking at the location potential of

95
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,359
seasonal timing

96
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,120
particularly for outdoor growing can

97
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
influence the strain selection

98
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
would you go with in the general

99
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,360
category the photodependent

100
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,480
true sativas or indicas or an autoflower

101
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,840
there's rudalus

102
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,679
where they're going to flower based on

103
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,519
the number of days

104
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,879
old and that could influence based on

105
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
the timing that you might be growing

106
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,120
outdoors

107
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,879
depending on what the conditions might

108
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,400
be repeating an indoor environment you

109
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,158
might be able to manipulate the lighting

110
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,680
a little bit more than say the outdoor

111
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,120
environment

112
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,360
now the autoflower remember you're going

113
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
to count the days for the autoflowers

114
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,959
they offer the advantage of knowing how

115
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
many days until flower and harvest for

116
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,158
planting purposes

117
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,759
however this will this offers the

118
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,359
greatest yield since the plants tend to

119
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,560
be smaller overall so it's important

120
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,920
consideration that

121
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,519
oh i don't have to worry about flower

122
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,039
and photo period i can put them in my

123
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,959
indoor whatever i got some veg

124
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,120
plants i got some flowering plants the

125
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,878
root owls or the autoflowers won't care

126
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
but because they tend to have smaller

127
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,639
plants will that offer the yield

128
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,719
that you're looking for these can be

129
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,119
limiting as there's a set of number or

130
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,120
fixed

131
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
days of plant production so can you

132
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,719
maximize each day

133
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,799
it's also important consideration there

134
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,000
where because there's only a limited

135
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
number of days

136
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,519
every day lost could be a greater

137
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,438
percentage of that plant's life or the

138
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,759
photoperiod dependent ones

139
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,039
you could always delay or shift when you

140
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,120
change from a vegetative

141
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,560
photo period to that flowering photo

142
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,798
period

143
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,839
so why not select the highest cbd

144
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,758
producing

145
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,279
plant looking at the strains i just want

146
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,720
the highest cbd producer

147
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,239
most growers will easily be drawn to a

148
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,080
strain that has the biggest numbers of

149
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,079
cbd or certain terpenes maybe

150
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,079
however this should be a consideration

151
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,918
but not the only consideration

152
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,680
as you need to know if you can maximize

153
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,478
plant production based on environmental

154
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
factors

155
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,399
just because a plant can produce a very

156
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,000
high cbd percentage

157
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,918
does not mean it will produce giving

158
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,600
your certain growing conditions so you

159
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,519
may want to be selecting one

160
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,199
that morphologically is a better fit

161
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,198
initially so you can get kind of

162
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,639
growing in some of the experiences with

163
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,478
that so you're not just getting the

164
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,879
highest cbd producer and maybe

165
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,599
having to deal with a very hard to

166
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,199
manage

167
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,040
plant morphology or one that requires

168
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
special pruning so again these are just

169
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,879
some of the questions you should be

170
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,319
asking

171
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,918
instead of just kind of randomly

172
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,199
