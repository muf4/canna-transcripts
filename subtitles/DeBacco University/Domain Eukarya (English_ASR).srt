1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,149
okay here we're gonna investigate the

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,580
domain Eukarya provide some examples to

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,359
show you how diverse this particular

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,000
domain is so starting with the basics it

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,070
appeared about 1.5 billion years ago

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,679
it contains organisms most people are

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:24,300
familiar with and they consist of four

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:29,670
kingdoms below the domain so first one

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,778
is animals plants and fungi and then

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,840
protist

11
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:36,840
the animals plants and fungi are well

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,480
defined evolutionary groups in a largely

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,719
multicellular protists are kind of their

14
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:46,078
own unique unicellular and very diverse

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,539
group here so all four of these though

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,730
are still under the domain Eukarya

17
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,149
but our four kingdoms within that can be

18
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,619
slightly different so Eukarya the

19
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,480
hallmark of eukaryotes is complex

20
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,089
cellular organization it's highlighted

21
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,959
by the presence of organelles

22
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,629
mitochondria and chloroplasts are the

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,960
most likely entered in early eukaryotic

24
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:09,239
cells through process of endosymbiosis

25
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:10,978
remember mitochondria descends of purple

26
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:15,390
bacteria and chloroplasts from its

27
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:18,539
cyanobacteria looking at this kingdom of

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,118
protists these organs are placed here

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,710
more because of what they are not been

30
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,009
what they are so this is kind of the

31
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:28,798
most diverse kingdom contains all

32
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,379
eukaryotes that are not plants animals

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,780
or fungi there's more than 50 thousand

34
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,408
species in all this includes unicellular

35
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,509
one as well as a few simple

36
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:41,640
multicellular eukaryotes this mode of

37
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,920
nutrition is how some of these protists

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,549
are classified so move around in search

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,530
of food

40
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,630
these are heterotrophic so make their

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,299
own food they're called autotrophs and

42
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:53,908
some observe absorb their own food which

43
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,579
are decomposers so these terms shouldn't

44
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,899
be that strange or foreign to you but

45
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,389
this just shows you some of the

46
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,019
diversity that does exist within the

47
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,978
kingdom of protists some examples

48
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:10,409
diatoms is a group of algae family

49
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,598
phytoplankton that looks very

50
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,590
interesting and if you look at some of

51
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,018
these they

52
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,610
have very unique shapes they're used in

53
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:19,620
art a lot

54
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,340
they're very symmetrical in some

55
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,009
instances and each are very unique in

56
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,500
this visual interest causes them to be

57
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:30,568
used a lot of posters or in a lot of

58
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,759
other mediums and these are diatoms

59
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:36,539
which are under the kingdom of protists

60
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,090
interest and other types of

61
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:42,030
photosynthetic protists are endemic of

62
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,549
some eukaryotic organisms see here this

63
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,500
prime example here's our coral which is

64
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,629
an animal and if you look inside this

65
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,318
animal we see there's an algae living

66
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:54,359
inside it so this is another example of

67
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,310
kind of this endosymbiosis and how these

68
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,190
two different organisms are coming

69
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,079
together for a common purpose ecology is

70
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,539
able to capture sunlight and produce

71
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:08,250
sugar from that and the animals able to

72
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:09,870
provide protection off of this algae so

73
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,530
chloroplasts enough symbiosis from our

74
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,000
chloroplast

75
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,829
are thought to be once free-living samo

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,019
bacteria that were engulfed by a

77
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:18,719
eukaryotic cell the presence of a double

78
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,069
membrane DNA both support this idea well

79
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,349
some other features but these are the

80
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:25,229
main two the sense that it was once

81
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:28,680
free-living and now incorporated into

82
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:30,899
the eukaryotic cell so a kingdom fungi

83
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,359
fungi are eukaryotes and most are

84
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,769
multicellular cells of fungi have cell

85
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:36,870
walls that contain the material called

86
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,750
chitin this includes molds and mildews

87
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:44,280
mushrooms in yeast chitin is also that

88
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:48,329
hard outer shell to insects or crabs or

89
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,818
lobsters or shrimp it's the same basic

90
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,639
material and they also produce some

91
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:57,509
mildews so they can be negative impacts

92
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,000
here on these grapes and yeast so cause

93
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:02,789
bread to rise we did a lab on yeast so

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,620
it was an example of an organism that

95
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:08,310
would be classified in the kingdom of

96
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,289
fungi within this kingdom of fungi it's

97
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,049
interesting is our heterotrophs and

98
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:14,848
obtain their nutrients by releasing

99
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:16,680
digestive enzymes into a food source

100
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:18,060
they absorb their food

101
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,519
after it's been digested by these

102
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,009
enzymes and broken down some they act

103
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,379
either as decomposers or as parasites in

104
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:27,060
nature this is kind of how they can look

105
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,969
here may have seen them

106
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm bred kind of breaking that down now

107
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,450
these structures are very unique fungi

108
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,740
have things called hyphae and mycelium

109
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,019
mycelium are these large structures here

110
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,540
vegetative part of the fungus they're

111
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,799
clear composed of Heisei and it's a

112
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,720
collection that I pay is another way to

113
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,850
think about it looks like a patch of

114
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,220
threads or strands and function at the

115
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,400
macro level this would be an example of

116
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,919
mycelium specifically here this small

117
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,089
region here would be an example -

118
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,159
they're fine

119
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:01,138
branching filaments and they make up

120
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,270
mycelium there's a building blocks of

121
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,150
fungi may look like threads or strands

122
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,459
made function at the micro level so a

123
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:10,439
lot of times this to be the exact site

124
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,138
of nutrient absorption then my scene

125
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,668
would be the larger structure so our -

126
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,918
would be these very thin like straight

127
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:18,990
weak regions if we go back to the other

128
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,299
slide for a moment this would be an

129
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,360
example here of the mycelium will do the

130
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,370
proper term there'd be - this specific

131
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,680
region right here be hyphae this whole

132
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,470
thing would be mycelium and there's a

133
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,180
good comparison between the two kingdom

134
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,130
of plants plants are you care act mosses

135
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,860
multicellular in our autotrophs because

136
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:39,060
they carry out the process of

137
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,819
photosynthesis conversion of light

138
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,009
energy to sugars we're going to spend on

139
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,589
an entire lecture series on this process

140
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:48,959
it's very complex but plants are able to

141
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:53,219
perform this we see a very diverse

142
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:55,978
Kingdom here in our plants plants have

143
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,620
cell walls that contain polysaccharide

144
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:00,779
cellulose polysaccharide meaning many

145
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,250
sugars we see here Flint cells are

146
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:04,319
specialized for different functions such

147
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,319
as synthesis and transport of and

148
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,329
support materials the xylem and phloem

149
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,709
moving of water and sugars within plant

150
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:15,029
and here's our cellulose a very complex

151
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:17,209
polysaccharide composed of a long chain

152
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:22,319
and branched chain connected chain of

153
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:24,329
glucose monomers or monosaccharides this

154
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,788
is an example of kind of how the kingdom

155
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:28,949
is organized and how flowering plants

156
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:31,349
are considered more advanced and say

157
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,060
your losses or the rewards are

158
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,879
considered very simple in their

159
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,939
structure vascular tissue started club

160
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,829
mosses breasted ferns and we see seeds

161
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:42,930
we're gonna spend a lot of time on

162
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:46,109
classification of plants this gives you

163
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,598
a basic introduction of gymnosperms or

164
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,939
angiosperms being more advanced and

165
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:53,579
again here's our common green algal

166
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,319
ancestor and all of these plants are

167
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:58,348
thought of to have derived from that

168
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,270
common ancestor the kingdom of animals

169
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:02,848
animals are multicellular eukaryotic and

170
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:04,649
heterotrophic animal cells have no cell

171
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:08,009
walls this is a major point try to put

172
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:09,329
it in bold here black a cell wall so if

173
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,569
there's presence of a cell wall you know

174
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:15,240
initially eliminate the classification

175
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,770
or kingdom of animals some are currently

176
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,960
attached the surfaces such as sponges

177
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:21,299
and barnacles this includes fish birds

178
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:25,769
reptiles and tibias mammals and also as

179
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:28,288
humans the kingdom is also include

180
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:31,889
sponges jellyfish worms sea stars in

181
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:35,360
insects sometimes the jellyfish or

182
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:37,710
especially our coral and sponges here

183
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,319
are often thought of as being something

184
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:42,478
else other than animals so you can get

185
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,729
just beyond the kind of obvious animals

186
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,728
all of these are animals too
