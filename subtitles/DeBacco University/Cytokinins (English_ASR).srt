1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
here we're gonna investigate the plant

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,150
hormones cytokinin

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,130
now as the image shows here it's two

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,710
cells dividing remember this process is

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,990
called cytokinesis so it's no surprise

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,048
and cytokinins are involved with cell

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,850
division so the main functions of

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:19,439
cytokine is well the first one is of

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,929
course promoting that cell division to

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,390
occur now cell division remembers

11
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,339
mitosis in that process so it's attic

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,800
items create more cell division or more

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,660
mitosis we know that more mitosis and

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
more cell divisions simply mean more

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,009
cells and more cells relates to plant

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,170
growth so cytokines are involved in

17
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,238
plant growth in addition to cell

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,640
division they also are responsible for

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,439
viral blood development so remember

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,450
along our strategy of these lateral buds

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,909
instead of cams will cause that to be

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,430
able to grow outward at that node along

23
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:53,398
the stem the last main function of

24
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:56,579
cytokinins is delays in essence what

25
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,299
senescence is is when leaves basically

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,878
age and develop and drop off the plant

27
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:05,158
so they can delay that process from

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,200
occurring that can keep leaves on plants

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,799
more useful and on the plant school

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,750
longer so the first one instead of canes

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,920
promotes cell division well cytokines

32
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,799
were actually first shown to stimulate

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,509
cell division looking at a root tip here

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,400
that's an area where there's a lot of

35
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,909
mitosis going on a lot of cell division

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,259
a lot of cytokinins that plant hormones

37
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:27,450
exist very high in this particular

38
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,938
region of the plant also germinating

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,280
seeds sedatives can be found in this as

40
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,438
reminders cytokinins said a Kinesis

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,269
sound very similar and that can help you

42
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,779
remember that a set of kinds are

43
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:41,849
involved in cell division so the kinds

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,530
increase lateral blood formations we see

45
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:45,509
here are lateral buds kind of branching

46
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,489
out set of kinds are involved in that

47
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,250
they've released buds from apical

48
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:51,959
dominance remember from the auxin video

49
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,569
lecture and talked about apical

50
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,000
dominance we see auxins instead of chi

51
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,919
minh's kind of play off one another when

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,549
auxins are in high concentration we see

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,769
routing on shoots we see root callus

54
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,350
forming as we're reducing our aux-in

55
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,689
levels were increasing our state of

56
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,909
chitin levels here we see exhilarate

57
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,810
buds developing society is responsible

58
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:16,120
for those lateral buds to form

59
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,849
that's in evidence that set of hands are

60
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,379
in higher proportion than auxins because

61
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:22,389
auxins are going to favor that apical

62
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:24,669
dominance so again you could see another

63
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:26,019
example here of how two hormones

64
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:27,699
interact with one another

65
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,920
keep in mind that these hormones to

66
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,539
exist in very small amounts but they can

67
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,259
have very large impacts on clan

68
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:37,599
behaviour saticons delay leaf senescence

69
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:39,969
called the Fountain of Youth hormone so

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,239
by delaying or even beaver seeing this

71
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:45,580
process plant leaves could maintain

72
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,950
their chlorophyll longer could delay the

73
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,200
protein degradation and increase the

74
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:52,599
lifespan and drought tolerance of

75
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:54,129
several plant species we see that here a

76
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,349
play that's been apply the cytokinins

77
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,819
keeps the leaves greener longer instead

78
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:59,979
of this plant here that has these dead

79
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,500
dried out leaves this is important here

80
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:05,289
in tobacco plants especially here in

81
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,719
Connecticut grow a lot of tobacco for

82
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:09,729
final wrappers for cigars and the goal

83
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,930
is to keep those leaves as useful and as

84
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:12,579
large as possible

85
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,260
we don't want plants going in to

86
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,630
senescence here and where they get kind

87
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:18,669
of crinkly and dried out they're not

88
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:21,609
really any good for the wrappers of

89
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:23,530
cigars by applying the set of cuttings

90
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,450
in some cases this could be a way the

91
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,269
Fountain of Youth hormone to keep the

92
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:32,229
leaves nice young and useful for a

93
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:35,049
longer period of time lastly this is

94
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:37,030
demonstrating cytokinins and induced

95
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:39,879
nutrient movement so we have three

96
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,370
different plants here dicots and it

97
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:45,549
could be squash seedlings for example

98
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,590
and we're having a cytokine and treated

99
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:49,989
leaf that shows the presence of a radio

100
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,390
labeled tagging amino acid which is

101
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,549
transferred from the untreated site but

102
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,548
tagged leaf site so what this actually

103
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:59,560
means here is we have three plants and

104
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:04,359
we've applied a tag the amino acid here

105
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:07,479
on these leaves will notice here we that

106
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:09,489
tagged amino acid remains in this leaf

107
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,409
this has been frayed with just a

108
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,450
surfactant which is basically a carrier

109
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:15,969
to put in water this indicates that

110
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:17,978
those radioactive labeled amino acid

111
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:20,259
stayed here here we applied the

112
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:22,360
radioactive amino acid also to this leaf

113
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:25,930
but we treated this other leaf on the

114
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,250
opposite side with acetic iDEN we notice

115
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,370
that basically moved

116
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,480
or call those nutrients / move those

117
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,310
radioactively labeled amino acids over

118
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,640
to the sleep Evan Bayh the dark green

119
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,610
color here just as a Chuck we applied

120
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,990
the radioactive amino acid in the set of

121
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,870
canons here we notice that they stayed

122
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,680
in that leaf so this shows the influence

123
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:50,139
that cytokines can have on calling over

124
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,250
certain nutrients in indicating that

125
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:53,019
cellular division

126
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,819
let's get an increased cellular division

127
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:57,219
that's probably require more nutrients

128
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:59,560
and that's part of the reason why set of

129
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,100
cones can influence plant behavior in a

130
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,850
sense of allocation of certain nutrients

131
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,710
hopefully that was helpful in explaining

132
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:09,510
a little bit about the Adept

133
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:09,509
cytokine it's going to have on plants
