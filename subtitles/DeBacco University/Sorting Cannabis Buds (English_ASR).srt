00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,318
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,639
going to look at two main

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,080
cannabis sorting categories we can see

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,919
here a much finer sort

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,160
but why it's important to sort your

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,160
cannabis buds shortly after harvest and

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
drying

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,480
[Music]

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,320
all right let's get into sorting

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,160
cannabis buds and we can see a great

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
kind of image of that here

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,640
how we have some really fines to some

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,719
more mid-size to some larger ones here

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,000
why is this important to go through this

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,239
process

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,238
so upon harvest we're looking at once

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,799
the buds are removed the sorting process

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,878
is basically beginning typically larger

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,238
buds yield the highest dollar value and

20
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,399
why those are typically

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,320
separated out smaller and less visually

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,359
desirable buds are typically destined

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,878
for extraction

24
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,039
or pre-rolls because they're not going

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,079
to drive the high dollar value

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,198
that a large single bud would do so when

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,198
we're storing cannabis we have kind of

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,079
our two main options we can sort based

29
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,320
on

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,079
size and density and advantages of doing

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,040
that is allows you to get top dollar

32
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,438
for a high quality product it also can

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,840
be

34
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,359
maybe not always but it can be automated

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,719
so you kind of see here with some

36
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,159
varying sizes

37
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,000
smaller buds will drop through the

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,280
smaller areas larger buds will work

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,239
their way further down and drop through

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
a larger area

41
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,438
that's how canvas can be very

42
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,200
efficiently sorted in automated sense

43
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,798
there's also other sorting methods

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,560
the disadvantage though is that this can

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,400
be a time consuming process

46
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,240
and can be subjective particularly if

47
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,079
you're doing it manually

48
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,519
other growers will go through this size

49
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,798
and density sorting and then they'll

50
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,478
have another category

51
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,079
where they basically are sorting buds

52
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,599
destined for extraction

53
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,559
the advantage is this can provide a

54
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,319
consistent end product for what could be

55
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,159
a variable starting product the

56
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,839
disadvantages is this can hide lower

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,399
quality flowers while still producing a

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,399
quality

59
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
end product so extraction because you're

60
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,359
not going to be actually looking at the

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,960
final flower the final bud

62
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,599
is sometimes used for those buds and

63
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,519
flowers that aren't quite presentable

64
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,039
aren't quite the right density aren't

65
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,519
quite have that visual

66
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
impact to drive the top dollar so

67
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,280
they're destined for extraction

68
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,039
where the cannabinoids terpenes will be

69
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,520
removed and we'll actually see the

70
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,439
actual

71
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,200
plant product and they'll still get

72
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,400
those extracts which will be the same as

73
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,000
if they came from a visually

74
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
appealing flower or a visually

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,719
unappealing flower in the end

76
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,719
in the extract it all comes out the same
