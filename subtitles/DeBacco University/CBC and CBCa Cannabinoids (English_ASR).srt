1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,798
this tobacco university video is going

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:16,239
to cover sometimes called the mysterious

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:18,879
cbc or cbca cannabinoid

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,118
all right so let's get into cbc and cbca

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,000
cannabinoids here produced in cannabis

6
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:23,839
plants

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,439
so first off a great research article if

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,160
you want to learn a little bit more of

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,559
information

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
you have the proper citation here so you

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,759
can expand your knowledge even

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,039
greater than what this video lecture

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,399
will provide

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,238
so first off as i said kind of

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,840
mysterious kind of

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,839
uh cbca or cbc of the major side-chain

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,760
cannabinoids the least is known about

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,039
cbca or cbc

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,039
similarly to all of the other

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,359
cannabinoids it has shown to have

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,480
some antimicrobial properties but again

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,519
we're trying to understand this one a

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,119
little bit more

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,440
it is synthesized by cannabis in the

25
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,718
same way as thca

26
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:02,159
and cbda and is synthesized uh it

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,280
also produces the phytotoxic byproducts

28
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,478
so we know a little bit about the

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,840
pathway we know a little bit about what

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,319
it's how it's produced

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
about the side products that are that

32
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,478
produce the byproducts

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,000
but still remains a little mysterious

34
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:14,959
however to provide you some information

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,560
about this particular

36
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:19,519
cannabinoid since often asked what is

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,439
cbc well it's a powerful

38
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,560
non-psychoactive cannabinoid meaning it

39
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,239
will not cause the

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,478
high feeling pre-pre pre-pre-clinical

41
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,359
unpublished so again keep that in mind

42
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,359
uh study

43
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,560
did demonstrate anti-tumor effects of

44
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,319
both cbg

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,359
as well as cbc against gastrointestinal

46
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,758
cancer cells

47
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,438
so again unpublished research pre kind

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,719
of clinical trials but give some at

49
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,519
least some indication

50
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,200
of potential good for future research

51
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,879
both these cannabinoids were shown to

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,920
induce significantly higher rates of

53
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,280
cancer cell death

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,399
compared to other cannabinoids and

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,200
suggest the need for further

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,920
investigation into synergistic

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,280
efficacy all important there and has

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
some early promise

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,879
for something that we currently don't

60
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,759
know a ton about

61
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,280
also relate to inflammation so cbc

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,719
battles inflammation by activating the

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,280
cb2 receptors

64
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,719
however because it does not activate cb1

65
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,840
the healing properties of

66
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,280
cbc could be enhanced when combined with

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,239
cannabinoids that do

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,878
such as thc so again you're getting into

69
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,039
this kind of

70
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,359
synergistic effect there not knowing a

71
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,318
lot about it but early indications

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,239
do have some potential medical promise

73
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,318
as well as potential combination

74
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,239
with other cannabinoids to get the

75
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,238
greatest positive effect
