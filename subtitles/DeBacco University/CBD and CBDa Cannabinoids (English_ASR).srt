1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,240
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,519
going to be covering cbd

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,919
in cbda cannabinoids commonly referred

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,919
to as

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,278
cannabidiol

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,719
all right so you may have heard of cbd

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:21,439
or cannabidiol this is the molecular

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,799
structure

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,439
here we're going to be getting into cbd

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,160
as well as cbda regarding cannabinoids

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,679
produced by cannabis plants so first off

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,000
here's a great research article you're

13
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:31,518
welcome

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,759
to take a look at some information was

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,679
pulled from here it goes from many

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,799
other cannabinoids as well so here's the

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,799
proper citation

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,640
if you want to learn about these in even

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,238
more detail than presented here

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
so we're looking at conversion by heat

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,519
here cbda

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,840
is converted to cbd by heat hemp which

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,239
is

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,800
classified as cannabis containing less

25
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,759
than 0.3 percent total thc

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,878
is often grown for the production of cbd

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,119
or cannabidiol

28
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,039
cbd has dozens of known therapeutic uses

29
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,358
including the reduction of inflammation

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,320
and in some cases often anecdotally the

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,359
reduction of

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,719
anxiety so here we're seeing the cbda

33
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,719
we're adding heat and that we're

34
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,719
generating the cbd and

35
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,400
carbon dioxide is a byproduct keep in

36
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,840
mind that two should be down here from a

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,920
true chemical standpoint

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
um as a chemist kind of don't like the

39
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,118
fact that

40
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,199
the 2 in co2 is written as a superscript

41
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,280
when it actually should be a subscript

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,719
check the description for the citation

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,640
of that source

44
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,679
so cbd synthesis so what we're looking

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,519
at and how we're going about

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,799
synthesizing this well cbda is

47
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,280
synthesized

48
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,079
by cbda synthase which is expressed by

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,280
type 3

50
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,758
or bdbd plants although types

51
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,478
2 and 3 are used for hemp production

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,280
only type 3 plants will remain compliant

53
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,039
through maturity and that compliant is

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,640
having a lower

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,920
than 0.3 thc the reduction

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,079
in the should say the reaction by which

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,399
cbda synthesis produces cbda from cbga

58
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,559
creates phytotoxic byproducts and

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,280
therefore takes place in the apoplastic

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,479
space

61
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,719
of the trichome secretory vesicle much

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
like thca so what does this kind of

63
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,359
summary mean well

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,040
because we're having other byproducts

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,120
being produced by this process

66
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,639
this is occurring within the trichome

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,560
but in the apple plastic space

68
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,000
because the plant needs to go through

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
and kind of detoxify

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
some other products or rid itself of

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,680
some other waste products that are being

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,159
converted or generated

73
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,000
as part of this conversion process

74
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,639
through enzymes

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,439
so looking at cbd related to seizures in

76
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,598
particular

77
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,120
it's been clinically proven that cbd is

78
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,679
a remarkable effective

79
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
treatment in severe epileptic seizures

80
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,280
charlotte figgy became a poster child

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
for cbd seizure medications and helped

82
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,640
create advocacy

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
which led to the introduction of this

84
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,679
particular

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,318
prescribed prescription i should say

86
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,319
epidialex for an extremely successful

87
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,439
medicine for childhood epileptic

88
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,280
seizures

89
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,800
there's a great video here on debacle

90
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,479
university that goes into a little bit

91
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,599
more about charlotte figgy

92
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,079
sadly passed away at the age of 13 was

93
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,560
said to

94
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,319
have done a lot of good for the cannabis

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,680
industry in general

96
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,839
so we'll talk about the commercially

97
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
available cbd cbd's widely used and

98
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,239
accepted cannabinoid available on the

99
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,158
commercial market

100
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,599
there's a lot of products there however

101
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,280
keep in mind that anything you're

102
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,959
looking at potentially purchasing

103
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,199
you should be getting an analytical

104
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,120
report that will not only gives you the

105
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,079
compounds that it contains but proof

106
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,840
that is passed

107
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,400
all sort of all the regulations than

108
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,158
necessary beyond just a flashy label

109
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
be sure that you are an informed

110
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,199
consumer with any products you're

111
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,200
looking at purchasing
