1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
here we're gonna look at a little more

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,600
detail how your body goes about

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,359
maintaining homeostasis if I have this

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,250
picture here of someone balancing on the

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,779
railing here that's exactly what your

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,298
body's trying to do trying to maintain

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:18,419
this balancing act that's occurring

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:20,420
despite changes that are happening in

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,868
your body on a daily hourly

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:27,359
minute-by-minute basis so starting first

11
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:28,800
with the basics of homeostasis well we

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,840
have our homeostasis we want to be nice

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,820
and level with an imbalance that's

14
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,789
occurring well that imbalance needs to

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,308
go through a receptor to detect that

16
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:40,829
change it needs to go to a control

17
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:43,409
center of some sorts that then will send

18
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,600
out an effector which will respond to

19
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:48,628
that change and help correct that

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,679
potential imbalance that did occur now

21
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:52,259
it's important to realize that

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,600
homeostasis does not involve keeping

23
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,420
conditions static there can be changes

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,460
that occur what's important to remember

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,760
is that involves keeping conditions

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,109
within a tightly regulated limits so

27
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,509
because you can change all we wanted

28
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,219
here but if we went to go outside of

29
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,770
this range this is where we have issues

30
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,900
that occur so as homeostasis is keeping

31
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:14,700
this very tight range so slight changes

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,320
are occurring but it's occurring within

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,868
a very tight range is very tight

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,250
balancing at go back to our person

35
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:22,379
balancing on the railing you can wave

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,359
her a little bit if you waver too far

37
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:28,259
you're gonna fall one way or the other

38
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,700
keep calm and maintain the stasis so

39
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,409
let's now look at some examples so

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,579
there's a negative feedback model it's

41
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,159
called so we have a specific body

42
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:37,709
condition we have something increasing a

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,340
gland releasing a hormone up causing the

44
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:43,379
lowering of that condition now if we

45
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,719
have a way if something's getting too

46
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,239
high to lower that condition locally if

47
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,310
the body overcorrects and over lowers

48
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,719
the condition it needs to typically be

49
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,670
another hormone that will then raise

50
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,408
that condition that's how our body is

51
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,540
able to try to maintain that homeostasis

52
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,159
is to maintain its raising it's trying

53
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,469
to bring it down it's too low it's

54
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,118
trying to bring it up so let's take this

55
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:05,399
as an example particularly at the

56
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,618
nervous system tied in with body

57
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,780
temperature so if our body temperature

58
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,189
for increasing their body temperature we

59
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,750
have nerve signals that respond to that

60
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,599
that will cause our body to sweat and

61
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,729
dilate our

62
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,879
blood vessels that will hopefully cool

63
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:21,729
our body temperature however if our body

64
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,319
temperature gets too cold right then we

65
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:24,699
will need a way we have different nerve

66
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,859
signals that would cause us to shiver

67
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:27,969
you constrict our blood vessels that

68
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,770
will then hopefully cause their body

69
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,109
temperature to raise you're able to

70
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,900
maintain that nice consistent body

71
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,640
temperature in our brain we have the

72
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,340
hypothalamus which is involved in

73
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,979
regulating body temperature so as a way

74
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,770
of both lowering our body temperature or

75
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:46,179
raising our body temperature connecting

76
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,920
this with the endocrine system we can

77
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,870
look at the blood sugar so our blood

78
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,359
sugar level if it gets too high we have

79
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,849
insulin that will be secreted by the

80
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,850
pancreas body cells take up sugar from

81
00:02:54,849 --> 00:03:00,759
the blood and reduce our appetite then

82
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:03,519
if I it overshoots we put too much sugar

83
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,409
into our cells our blood sugar level

84
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,300
gets too low glucagon will be released

85
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:10,090
and this triggers hunger and this

86
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,910
deliver will release glucose from the

87
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,830
cells increasing blood sugar levels and

88
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:17,560
that will hopefully through this system

89
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:21,430
of insulin and glucagon it will be able

90
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,039
to maintain a consistent level or a

91
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,670
consistent range of blood sugar in the

92
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,669
body system
