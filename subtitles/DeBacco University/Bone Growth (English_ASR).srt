1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,750
a hermit tempt to simplify the process

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,179
of bone growth and remodeling and see

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,789
how this interval aids with the process

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,589
of our growing skeleton the stream with

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,019
bone growth bones are remodeled in

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:18,359
lengthen until grow stops bones change

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:21,059
shaped a little bit depending on the

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,970
conditions that they may face and bones

9
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,129
also need to grow in width as we

10
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:29,399
progress from the embryo to the fetus to

11
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,868
a child ultimately the adult stage we

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,390
see at the embryonic stage we have a

13
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:36,869
high amount of cartilage present within

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,359
the bones and over time we see an

15
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,759
increase in the replacing of that

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:45,390
cartilage with more of this ossification

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,159
region in this newly forming bone that

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,308
is newly forming bone is occurring and

19
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,229
helping the length of the bone and also

20
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:54,539
the width of the bone to help support

21
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,640
the increased weight cartilage will

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,770
still be left even in adults it's a very

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,620
ends basically the head regions of the

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,539
bones when a bone needs to articulate

25
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:07,079
with another bone to create a smooth

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,629
surface so this ossification process

27
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:13,228
this is the formation of bone we have

28
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:16,199
this high amount of cartilage and slowly

29
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:19,049
being replaced with this spongy bone

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,030
here this de-emphasis region remember

31
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,040
that's the long portion of the long bone

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,560
and that's what's increasing remember

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,990
this contains our marrow we're talking a

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,228
very young individual but gain a lot of

35
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:33,390
red bone marrow and as we age that red

36
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:35,400
bone marrow will slowly be replaced with

37
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,859
yellow bone marrow as we pose mostly a

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,228
fat and adult we're considering at the

39
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,359
age of 25 because nearly all the bones

40
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:46,319
are completely ossified in humans by the

41
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:49,170
age of 25 now bone gross-looking

42
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,438
specifically an x-ray here but 12 year

43
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,560
old child showing the growth plates and

44
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:58,139
these plates these growth plates these

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,329
piphus steel plates are the regions that

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,549
are actually growing the new cartilage

47
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,929
is continuously formed older Carlos

48
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,820
becomes ossified remember the

49
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,179
ossification process is basically

50
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:11,219
forming that College into bone Carla is

51
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,870
broken down and bone replaces that

52
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,060
cartilage over time

53
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,849
this is a femur again this is our thigh

54
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,360
bone one of our longest of long long

55
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:23,128
bones there and the mature long bone see

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,040
in comparison to that growing long bone

57
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:29,429
we see the diathesis reaching its full

58
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,530
length there the other regions are

59
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,709
maintaining very similar shapes may be

60
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,500
increasing in width depending on the age

61
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,848
spread of this individual but the key

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,689
part here is that diathesis is

63
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:45,298
increasing in length now long bone

64
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:47,189
growth in remodeling will growth in

65
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,650
length the college continually grows

66
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:51,509
interview placed by bone as shown so we

67
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,030
have cartilage growing right here you're

68
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:56,789
in here the college is replaced by bone

69
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,640
at this distinctive lie the college

70
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:02,039
grows in this region here and the

71
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:05,789
cartilage is replaced by bone in this

72
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,658
more central portion of the of the long

73
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:09,719
bone here

74
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:11,878
so this growth occurs in length because

75
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,039
we're replacing this College through the

76
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:18,719
ossification process with bone causing

77
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:21,358
that bone to grow in its length so what

78
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,419
is remodeling then well remodeling is

79
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:26,969
growing shaft is remodeled in relation

80
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:30,209
to conditions or stresses that this bone

81
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:33,180
may be under so we have our bone being

82
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,878
reabsorbed in this region bone is added

83
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,189
by the appositional growth here and bone

84
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,929
is being reabsorbed here we're

85
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:43,348
remodeling we're slightly changing the

86
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,540
shape of the bone now this remodeling is

87
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:48,659
actually can be regulated under two

88
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,519
different control mechanisms want to be

89
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,739
hormonal which maintains calcium

90
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,269
homeostasis in the blood and another

91
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,120
could be mechanical or gravitational

92
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,530
forces acting on the skeleton we learn

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,449
about these a little bit later in this

94
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,609
presentation but keep in mind that our

95
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:07,019
remodeling is actually under two

96
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:08,639
different uncontrolled herbs now the

97
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,449
structure of short irregular and flat

98
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,299
bones these are a little different

99
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:14,579
choosing to compare these initially here

100
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,739
thin plates of compact bone which is

101
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:20,579
right here and the outside of spongy

102
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:25,589
bone and the dipole on the inside they

103
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,400
have no deficits or ethicists here they

104
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:29,009
contain

105
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,839
the bone marrow betaine the bhikkhu i

106
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,579
the trabeculae are kind of these

107
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:36,599
structures that give this bone is kind

108
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:38,310
of spongy look our in infants it's found

109
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,430
in the medullary cavity the areas of

110
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,810
along spongy bone are red bone marrow

111
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,750
remember in adults found in the dipole

112
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,620
of flat bones in the head of the femur

113
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,209
and also the humerus as we age that red

114
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,769
bone marrows being replaced with yellow

115
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:54,750
bone marrow but it's still very

116
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:56,579
important that as adults we have red

117
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,418
bone marrow to generate this necessary

118
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:01,430
cells we need for the circulatory system

119
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:03,709
importance of ionic calcium in the body

120
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,629
costumes necessary for many things

121
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:09,989
transmission of nerve impulses muscle

122
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,909
contraction blood coagulation secretion

123
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,350
by glands and nerves and cell division

124
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,340
so it's very important that we maintain

125
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:20,729
a distinct amount of calcium in our body

126
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:23,069
more than just four bones wall bones

127
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:25,050
themselves yes do composed about 99

128
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:28,550
percent of the total calcium in our body

129
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:32,160
that other 1% also has very important

130
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:35,220
functions in the body in class we looked

131
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,729
at read this article so calcium intake

132
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,169
calcium bioavailability and bone health

133
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:43,800
discuss the bioavailability of calcium

134
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:45,209
the impact that has on the body so just

135
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,400
because you're consuming the right

136
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:49,739
amount of calcium that calcium is not

137
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:53,429
bioavailable that can impact the overall

138
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,168
health of the individual I talked about

139
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,579
this kind of regulating calcium levels

140
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,709
where there's two different ways there's

141
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:00,659
a hormonal mechanism we're raising blood

142
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:02,939
calcium levels triggers the thyroid to

143
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,729
raise calcitonin calcitonin still is

144
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,990
calcium salt deposits in bone so here

145
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:08,909
we're adding an increase in calcium

146
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,720
level trying to get back to the normal

147
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,810
we are activating this calcitonin think

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,580
of calcitonin is putting calcium in the

149
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,680
stomach's calcium deposits in bone

150
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:22,050
calcium levels are being brought into

151
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,360
the bone meaning they're being reduced

152
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,120
at the circulatory system level and

153
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,139
we're returning to that normal level so

154
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,030
here we have a normal level we're

155
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,460
increasing it we're releasing calcitonin

156
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:35,250
put in the calcium in being reabsorbed

157
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,750
into the bones and this is what's

158
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,839
decreasing the calcium levels in the

159
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,610
blood causing it to reach a normal level

160
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,229
we have to keep in mind we have to also

161
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,699
worry about the other side of things if

162
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,069
calcium levels drop

163
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:50,219
so if we have falling calcium levels

164
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:53,930
this can signal this glands to release

165
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,240
this Oracle PTH this is released

166
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,040
osteoclast release calcium from the bone

167
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,230
calcium is reabsorbed from the urine and

168
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,669
kidneys this is increased mer calcium

169
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,189
levels and getting them back to the

170
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:07,379
normal so keep in mind if we even those

171
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:09,300
have decreasing calcium levels we're

172
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,219
gonna have osteoclasts release calcium

173
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,160
breakdown calcium from the bone to

174
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,910
maintain this very vital 1% in our

175
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,620
circulatory system in addition to the

176
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,139
hormonal conditions we also have

177
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,060
mechanical stresses Wolf's laws of bone

178
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,970
grows or remodels in response to forces

179
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,410
or demands placed upon it long bones are

180
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,540
thickest midway through the shaft where

181
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,590
bending stresses greatest curved bones

182
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,050
are thickest where they're most likely

183
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:36,000
to buckle it's just some compression and

184
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,319
tension lines remember compression

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,689
forces are what we push something

186
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,300
together in tension would be pulling

187
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:45,269
something apart here common if you've

188
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,710
ever researched stresses on bridges your

189
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:49,019
bones are going through that same thing

190
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:51,329
and this mechanical stress can cause

191
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,649
bones to be remodeled in a way where

192
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:57,120
they're strengthening the weakest part

193
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:59,219
on them the trabeculae remember form

194
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,340
along the lines of stress is this kind

195
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,410
of webbing material here large bony

196
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:08,689
projections occur where heavy active

197
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:12,330
muscles attach so keep in mind on the

198
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:14,129
ways to move these the muscles it points

199
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:16,159
to attachment that's also going to be an

200
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,228
area where we're having this increased

201
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,910
responses mechanical stress so the

202
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:22,469
forces that are applied we want to make

203
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,389
sure our bones are nice strong and

204
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,450
healthy and they can remodel or

205
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:29,160
strengthen areas potential weakness to

206
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:33,259
reduce the chance of the buckling

207
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,259
breaking or even fracturing
