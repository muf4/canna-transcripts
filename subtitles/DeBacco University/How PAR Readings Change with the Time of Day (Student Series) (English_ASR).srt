1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,798
on this debaco university student series

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,519
video we're going to see how par

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,839
readings change with the time of day by

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,480
taking some samplings different times of

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,599
the day and just seeing how quickly that

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
sunlight can really reduce that par over

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,920
time

8
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:25,839
[Music]

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,960
all right before we get into the video i

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,879
just want to let you know that par

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,039
meters do have different modes you want

12
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,960
to make sure that the parameters are in

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,200
the indoor light setting and for the

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,640
electric or if you're outdoors make sure

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,399
you're set to sun there so you're

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,878
getting accurate readings

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,480
in your different locations there also

18
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,320
the location specifically we'll be

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,759
seeing this video was taken on a sunny

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,200
day during the first week of august in

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,920
the northern hemisphere give you the

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,440
approximate gps coordinates provided

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,440
right here this is in southern new

24
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,519
england elevation was about 50 feet

25
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:59,039
above sea level and the park readings

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,440
were taken from noon to 7 35 pm and you

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,760
could see when the official

28
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,039
sunrise and sunset was for the day as

29
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,438
well as the duration of sunlight there

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,520
i'll just give you the unit for par

31
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,599
readings it's micro moles per meter per

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,359
second there and this gives you the noon

33
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:20,079
reading the 3 pm and the 5 pm we'll see

34
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,239
some additional closer time intervals as

35
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,079
the day progresses just to see how those

36
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,438
par readings change and hope you enjoy

37
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,920
it

38
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,919
so right now we're outside taking a

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,240
we're using our par reader to compare

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,320
the par of the sun with the power of our

41
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,478
artificial lighting inside

42
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,000
right now it's about 6 p.m the first

43
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,719
week of august

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,040
my par reader is reading about

45
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:46,719
720 just over 700.

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,960
now with this information we could

47
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,959
compare with our insight

48
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,039
today is the same day the first week of

49
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,039
august just an hour later from when we

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,560
took our last par reading so now it is

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,920
seven o'clock

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,840
and we're taking a par reading of about

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,560
145 which is drastically different from

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,040
the 700 that we got just an hour ago at

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,280
6 00 pm

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,520
so we are outside again taking another

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,080
par reading it's the same day the first

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,599
week of august just 15 minutes since our

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,760
last reading at seven it's now 7 15 and

60
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,878
we're reading at only about

61
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,439
27 to 28 for our par reading which again

62
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:28,719
is a drastic difference from the 100 it

63
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:31,199
was just 15 minutes ago

64
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,519
so we are back outside again about a 10

65
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,639
minutes later on the same day first week

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,360
of august to take another par reading

67
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:42,479
right now it's about 7 25

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,400
and we're only reading about 14 or 15

69
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,399
now compared to

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,879
what it was just 10 minutes ago

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,640
so now are out for our final par reading

72
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,719
of the day it is still the same day the

73
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,119
first week of august except it is 10

74
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,919
minutes after our last reading meaning

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,158
that it is 7 35 p.m

76
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,719
right now we're reading at about a six

77
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,878
or a seven compared to just 10 minutes

78
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,959
ago when we were at double digits at 10.

79
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,959
we are now officially in the singular

80
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,959
digits

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,640
you
