1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
okay with cannabis you want to be

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,330
careful in time your harvest properly

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,670
those weeds II kind of in this image

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,349
here with all the birds and the cleverly

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:13,019
placed glass that makes it look like

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,079
they're flying out the timing of your

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,410
harvest can be very important so that

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,358
timing the goal is to hit the peak of

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,310
maturity too early and the buds will be

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,170
immature and not have quite the

11
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,509
cannabinoid content that you may want in

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,859
too late the substances cannabinoids

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,300
terpenes will break down reducing its

14
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:35,100
desirability of your particular end

15
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,128
product so your goal is to time it just

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,230
right so it's just at the perfect time

17
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:42,449
to get the maximum at a yield maximum

18
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:46,439
editor beans max amount of cannabinoids

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,329
in your particular blood and time we can

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,189
help improve the harvest because the

21
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,189
aging and curing process is also

22
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:55,079
important so I want to negate that to

23
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,359
help improve taste and fragrances while

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,829
also maintaining shelf-life however

25
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,509
depending on the specific compounds

26
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,750
targeted the harvest time it may differ

27
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:07,228
to sure ensure to maximizing the harvest

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,959
of your particular end product so for

29
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:11,969
THC production typically increases at

30
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,478
the very end of the plant's life cycle

31
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:17,009
remember high THC elevated levels of THC

32
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,679
will classify something as marijuana

33
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,019
here we're looking at CBD or hemp in

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,630
particular now in regards to CBD

35
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:28,379
production peak CBD production typically

36
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:30,000
occurs before peak THC so it's important

37
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,459
for cultivators that are paying playing

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,129
a close line with the federal limit to

39
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,709
know when one cannabinoid may peak and

40
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:40,250
versus another again here if you let it

41
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:42,929
go too far THC may increase - high

42
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,599
reason why that's important is the

43
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,579
classification of hemp to marijuana as a

44
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,478
result it's possible for a chemist plant

45
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:53,158
to be legal below 0.3 percent THC but

46
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,530
then later in the season could become

47
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,859
illegal meaning it will test higher than

48
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,930
0.3 percent THC so testing is important

49
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,420
to know your cultivator your cultivar

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,060
that you're using as a grower and to

51
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,209
make sure you're playing that line as

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,649
hemp and not getting into the marijuana

53
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:13,800
classification with that elevated level

54
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,719
of THC and for some variety

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,700
for some cultivars that could

56
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,870
potentially happen if you let it go too

57
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:24,500
long because THC production occurs later

58
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,150
in the lifecycle of the cannabis plant

59
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,740
now cannabinoids in general are found in

60
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,379
greatest concentrations and the flowers

61
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,150
with some found in nearby leaves like

62
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,680
for example here and here but again this

63
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,810
is where your greatest concentration is

64
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,879
going to be here yeah post harvest can

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,680
eminent content can begin to slowly

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,719
degrade with light and high temperatures

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,180
high temperatures define as 80 degrees

68
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,219
Fahrenheit and above all so excessive

69
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,890
handling and high humidity conditions

70
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,150
can speed up this degradation process as

71
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:55,229
a result these are conditions that you

72
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,700
want to keep your harvest away from and

73
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:58,229
determine the peak ripeness looking

74
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,119
carefully at the resin production and

75
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:02,429
the flowers is how you tell when the

76
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,409
peak of ripeness has been reached can be

77
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,450
done with and maked islets much easier

78
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,789
with a small handheld magnifying loupe

79
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:10,739
here typically a 30 X power is what's

80
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,469
recommended it has its own internal

81
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,689
light an LED light there's some of the

82
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:17,009
best ones you can use an ideal for

83
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:19,650
determine the harvest time and also

84
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:22,919
scanning for potential insects again

85
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,140
you're looking for those resident you

86
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,879
can't one them perfectly clear you don't

87
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,799
want them perfectly milky just one on

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,329
that slate translucent if you let them

89
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,430
go too long they'll start to dry out and

90
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,240
get orangie Brown it's a little bit too

91
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,770
far gone

92
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,780
so again just going through and

93
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,700
inspecting the actual buds that you have

94
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,580
will allow you to determine the exact

95
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:45,289
peak of ripeness to maximize your

96
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,290
harvest and yield from your crop
