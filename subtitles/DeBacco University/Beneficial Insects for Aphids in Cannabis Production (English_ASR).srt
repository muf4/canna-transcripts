00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,839
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,919
going to be looking at beneficial

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,320
insects for aphids in cannabis

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,839
production and how you can utilize these

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,798
beneficial insects instead of

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,798
insecticides for controlling an aphid

7
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,798
population

8
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,600
[Music]

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,919
all right so let's get into the video

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,240
here to help you control your aphids

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,960
with beneficial insects here's a link to

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,799
the article and the proper citation for

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
that article if you want to look at more

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,320
of the information particularly of their

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,878
materials and methods and they studied

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,480
more than just aphids in this article

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,399
so first off challenges in the

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,558
greenhouse production just in general

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,039
well greenhouse cannabis cultivation in

20
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,959
insect infestations can cause many

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,960
losses across the board synthetic

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,359
chemicals and insecticides have been our

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,799
go-to option in the past but with the

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,759
stringent

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,759
scanning of final flower in materials

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,920
and legal restrictions as far as

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,519
applications of any sort of products

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,558
this is all the driving force between

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
the development of the new

30
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,399
environmentally friendly

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,679
and profitable methods for insect

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
control

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,320
for the plants

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,720
so the greenhouse studies a little bit

35
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,199
of the background it was conducted at in

36
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,478
the agriculture university of athens the

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,000
chemist plants were grown in two

38
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,599
different greenhouses the beneficial

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,519
insects were released only in one

40
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,280
greenhouse the treatment as we'll see

41
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,158
and no additional pesticides were used

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,320
during cultivation it gives you the

43
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
monash's variety that was used as well

44
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,758
as the temperature and humidity

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,438
fluctuations for the growing environment

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,840
now the beneficial insects the release

47
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,959
date three weeks after the

48
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,560
transplantation beneficial insects were

49
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,319
released to the treated greenhouse in

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,280
order to assess the efficiency of the

51
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,959
biological pest management

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,159
so the species here that we're going to

53
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,000
focus on is aphids so that was the main

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
one that was identified this is

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
generally how they look i'll show you a

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,399
little bit more specifics of some

57
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,718
variants just to give you an idea of how

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,399
small they are if you haven't seen them

59
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,839
they tend to be found also on the

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,118
underside of the leaves at least

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
initially

62
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,959
so the basics measures here here we can

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959
see a bunch of different insects and all

64
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,199
identified right down there

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,439
but basic measurements include visual

66
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,439
estimations of the infestation recording

67
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,280
of the pest species and populations and

68
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,359
comparison of infestations between the

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,439
two greenhouses and only the nymphs and

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,760
adult stages of the pests were counted

71
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,199
not the egg stage for any of the insects

72
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,878
that they studied

73
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,238
now the pest population determination

74
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,878
how do we determine how was that

75
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,480
determined uh basically the past

76
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,239
populations were taken in the third

77
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,439
fifth and seventh and ninth week of the

78
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,759
growing the number of avid pests was

79
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,199
counted with a hand lens in order to

80
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,959
identify the efficiency of the

81
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,039
beneficial insects average pest

82
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,959
populations were measured in ten plants

83
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,598
four leaves per plant per greenhouse on

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,120
average so it's important with any pest

85
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,199
that we're looking at studying and this

86
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,360
is true for aphids as well as others to

87
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,119
have an idea what the life cycle is of

88
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,959
that past now there's a lot of

89
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
information here so

90
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,560
you're welcome to pause the video and

91
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
take a look at it more yourself

92
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,800
but key parts here are that they're a

93
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,599
piercing sucking insect and aphids can

94
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,840
also

95
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,079
transmit viruses as well they'll be a

96
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,719
vector for viruses

97
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,239
so that's another reason to keep their

98
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,158
numbers under control on top of the

99
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,640
physical damage they can do also the

100
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,560
transmission of viruses now they have a

101
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,559
complex life cycle

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,239
it's what's kind of weird about aphids

103
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,479
in particular is that females can give

104
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,640
birth to live already pregnant young

105
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,399
female clones so it's kind of like they

106
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,719
can really mass multiply very very fast

107
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,879
so keep that in mind as well

108
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,560
now identification of aphids well we're

109
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,479
going to kind of generally put them all

110
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,318
in the same general classification here

111
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,238
of aphids i want you just to realize

112
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,399
that there are different species cotton

113
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,000
or melon aphids compared to your green

114
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
peach potato

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,719
peach potato potiphabacco aphids or your

116
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,680
true potato aphids your foxclavits how

117
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,280
all of these are in the same category

118
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,159
but their head shapes can be used for

119
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,080
identification coloration and some more

120
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,239
details here so if you had avids and

121
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,840
identified them with a magnifying loop

122
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,239
you can probably identify the specific

123
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
type that you have in your particular

124
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,280
growing operation

125
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
now it's beneficial insects at target

126
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
aphids this is what the study looked at

127
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,079
and they looked at the apodius

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,240
combination here and they are small

129
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,000
wasps and they parasitize the aphids we

130
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,079
can see here this wasp actually infects

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,600
the aphids with

132
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,439
small little eggs

133
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
that go on to complete their life cycle

134
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,639
and then basically eventually just take

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
out the aphid population many species do

136
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,319
occur in the northeast and enter

137
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,880
greenhouses naturally so this is why

138
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,040
broad insecticide killing of everything

139
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,759
is not advised this gives you also the

140
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,000
life cycle here of the afidius as well i

141
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,919
mean there's about a two week life cycle

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,759
for them and this is that ready to

143
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,399
infect those aphids there just shows you

144
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,040
a little size and visual comparison

145
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,038
now another uh beneficial insect here

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,879
these are green lace wings

147
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,079
chrysophelia

148
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,600
canaria

149
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,159
and they are green lace wings we can see

150
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,080
an adult right here and then we see the

151
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,479
larval stage here so very contrasting

152
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,879
larval to adult stage again some more

153
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,038
information here their eggs kind of of

154
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,959
the green lace wings are kind of like

155
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,240
these white little areas on a thin

156
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,239
little hair

157
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,240
kind of suspended there so you can take

158
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,400
a look and hopefully find some of those

159
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,038
this kind of again shows you their life

160
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,879
cycle as well so both of these are

161
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,439
beneficial insects specifically to

162
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,360
target if you have aphids

163
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,959
uh in the other control so how were they

164
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
you know how the application methods

165
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,799
well for the affodias here they were put

166
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,960
in what's called dye boxes which are

167
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,560
like little boxes that basically hang

168
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,799
within the plants

169
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,959
the lacewings the larvae was basically

170
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
introduced by sprinkling the content

171
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,959
from the bottle around the area so these

172
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,360
a lot of times this comes in sawdust or

173
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,198
rice hulls so they're very very small so

174
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,199
you're spreading that also keep in mind

175
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
you want to keep these well spread

176
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,800
because the green lacewings can

177
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,280
campbellize themselves before going

178
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
after any aphid species

179
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,000
now what did the numbers look like

180
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,080
what's the what did the data actually

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,120
show and this kind of provides you an

182
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,478
idea of the actual data here so overall

183
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,399
great reduction in aphid numbers with

184
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,240
the beneficial insect treatments final

185
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,239
numbers were not may not be zero in a

186
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,000
population but to have only about four

187
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,360
and a half per plant when treated with

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,360
the beneficial insects compared to 300

189
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,439
in control plants it shows a massive

190
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
reduction this gives you the specific

191
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,199
kind of information right here their

192
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,359
data table and the graph really speaks

193
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,080
to the treatment here so initially week

194
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,680
three uh populations in both greenhouses

195
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,680
were relatively the same at least not

196
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
statistically different we can see the

197
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,120
control which is the one that did not

198
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,038
have any beneficial insects how it

199
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,959
massively went through an exponential

200
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,639
increase it did drop a little for week

201
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,079
nine but when we compare these to the

202
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,800
control treatments the ones that had the

203
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,198
beneficial insects we can see their ever

204
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,240
decreasing numbers here

205
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,639
so a great benefit to utilizing

206
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
these beneficial insects

207
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,759
so average number of pests in the

208
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,680
population as i said the study did look

209
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,759
at other insects but focusing

210
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,959
specifically on the aphids right here

211
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,240
and that's what the numbers i quoted

212
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,000
before average number of pest

213
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,120
populations in the treatment greenhouse

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,519
and 80 plants and we could see the

215
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,959
great comparison um there and we got

216
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:26,240
that down only 368 per 80 plants these

217
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,839
are numbers are in per week here there

218
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,519
so a continuous reduction in all pest

219
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,839
populations was observed throughout the

220
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,359
experiment approaching zero value per

221
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,198
plant so kind of maybe not reaching the

222
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,479
zero but definitely getting very close

223
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,319
to zero

224
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,159
now what was not mentioned in this study

225
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,439
uh was actually a lady beetles which a

226
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,520
lot of you may think of when you hear

227
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,918
aphids you might think oh i treat with

228
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,240
you know lady beetles well keep in mind

229
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,318
if you are going to go with lady beetles

230
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,598
they can kind of tear it rapidly if

231
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
they're not handled properly you can

232
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,159
have a lot of loss or death loss their

233
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,000
die back on ones that you're purchasing

234
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,520
so keep them refrigerated if they cannot

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,319
be used immediately but should be used

236
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,399
immediately use adequate release dates

237
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,560
oftentimes repeated applications about

238
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,799
seven days apart is needed for if you're

239
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,160
utilizing lady beetles lead beetles need

240
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,079
a good supply of aphids so if your

241
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,160
population of aids is really low

242
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,399
consider other options at least lady

243
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,479
beetles at the dusk or early evening

244
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,878
kind of when the sun or lights are kind

245
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,800
of going off there to avoid the heat of

246
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,720
the day upon their initial release

247
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,520
expect lady beetles to fly away in a few

248
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,599
days about 95 percent of ladybills will

249
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,000
fly away in 48 hours with the rest being

250
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,479
gone in four to five days uh and they

251
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,719
are unlikely to lay eggs in your plants

252
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,200
so if aphids do return you will have to

253
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,839
re-induce lady beetles probably why they

254
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,800
weren't a participant in this particular

255
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,480
study

256
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,000
now are beneficial insects worth the

257
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,920
effort to get this question a lot and in

258
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
short yes this study indicates that

259
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,759
beneficial insects could control pest

260
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
populations up to 100 percent pest

261
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,439
management with natural enemies is

262
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,560
promising very effective safe method for

263
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,240
plant protection as well as applicator

264
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,079
and so this is a little effort there

265
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,839
that timing is important

266
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,680
so keep all that in mind but you can

267
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,680
have great control

268
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,679
lastly what growers need to keep in mind

269
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,919
is really that proper pest

270
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,679
identification is important since this

271
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,439
will determine the exact beneficial

272
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,319
insect to use if you misdiagnose the

273
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,080
insect if you misdiagnose it and apply

274
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,000
the wrong beneficial insects it's going

275
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
to be very little effectiveness and this

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,879
does require by the grower frequent

277
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,879
scouting

278
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,879
timing and rate of beneficial insects is

279
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,879
also important and depending on what

280
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,240
insect you're trying to target

281
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,000
different areas where you can purchase

282
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,560
those insects will provide those

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,120
recommendations hopefully this was

284
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,759
helpful to you to identify and control

285
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,159
aphid populations and this can hopefully

286
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,278
help save your plants an environmentally

287
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,278
friendly way
