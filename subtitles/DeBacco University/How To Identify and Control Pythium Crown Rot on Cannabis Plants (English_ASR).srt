1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
in this debaco university video we'll be

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,759
looking at how to identify and control

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,919
pythium or crown rot

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,000
in cannabis plants so we can see here

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,638
can affect them at the early stages

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,039
in later in stages so one to be mindful

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,919
of

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,919
as a grower

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,160
[Music]

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,839
so because pythium can affect plants at

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,920
early stages in later stages

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,879
it's important to be able to identify

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,279
this and also

14
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,879
have a control idea because it's

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,759
something growers should be scouting for

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,920
through all stages of the plant cycle so

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,799
first off identification is important

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
and there are several different

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,399
pathogenic species that can cause

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,320
disease in a wide host range

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,920
python is a water mold so it can travel

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,000
to new host plants via water

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,840
and that can be irrigation water root

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,439
rots and lower stem decay cause above

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
ground symptoms such as marginal leaf

26
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,000
scorch

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
stunting poor plant vigor and or

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,799
inconsistent stands if you're looking

29
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,479
down a long row

30
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,919
it can also produce oh spores that can

31
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,198
overwinter which can be an issue if

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,039
you're looking at planting in that same

33
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,879
field the following year

34
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,320
most notably causes root rots that can

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
be field identified

36
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,839
by pulling out the roots and then trying

37
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,039
to strip the outer layer so this is your

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,880
kind of your root area

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,400
you take your roots and try to strip off

40
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,039
that our layer if it comes off really

41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
easy

42
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,118
that can be a sign you may have pithium

43
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,840
the above ground

44
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,280
seedlings can damp off which is a common

45
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,040
propagation areas

46
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,200
and larger plants will express chlorosis

47
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
of leaves once pythium infects hemp

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,640
plants there's really no cure

49
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,798
so being able to identify and know that

50
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,000
you have it is important for making out

51
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,520
for making ideas and plans for following

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,400
years as far as probably not planting in

53
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,039
that field or rotating out so what's the

54
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
general

55
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,759
life cycle of pythium well we can see

56
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,519
here it is uh it is root based

57
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,840
uh it can cause that kind of infection

58
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,959
we see that spores oh spores as i said

59
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,439
swimming kind of in the water zoospores

60
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,478
germination attaches to the root infects

61
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,478
that portion

62
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,239
grows up in the plant causes a blighted

63
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,478
plant causes a dead plant

64
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,280
when that plant dies all those roots and

65
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,840
have all those

66
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,878
additional spores or elantrium

67
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,959
fertilization occurs causing it to

68
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,519
spread to directly germinate to infect

69
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,680
more

70
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,959
and really can cause this to spread

71
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,480
quite quickly

72
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,759
so what are some common methods of

73
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,878
spreading as it does a pretty good job

74
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,799
of it on its own

75
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,079
but soil substrate transfer such as

76
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
tools containers or even

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,400
shoes can transfer epithelium from one

78
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,480
field to another

79
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,239
contaminated water containing irrigation

80
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,119
water or runoff can also cause it to

81
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,039
spread

82
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,039
infected plants should be isolated

83
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,280
removed tagged and bagged

84
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,799
to prevent any sort of spread to healthy

85
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,039
neighboring plants

86
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,879
there's winter over inoculum present

87
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,560
from previously infected plants and also

88
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,840
poor sanitation protocols

89
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,159
particularly if you're in an indoor

90
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,159
growing operation so how do you go about

91
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,919
managing pythium or crown rot

92
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,159
we want to manage soil moisture in the

93
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,839
root zone inspect any new plant material

94
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,400
entering the growing area

95
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,400
for disease as well as insects ensure

96
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,080
proper aeration of the substrate

97
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,158
keep nitrogen at optimum but not

98
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,680
excessive levels and you want to avoid

99
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:06,479
salt accumulation within the substrate

100
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
that will cause

101
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,840
plant stress as well have sanitation

102
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,439
protocols in place

103
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,878
even if this is not identified if you

104
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,919
think your plants are clean hopefully

105
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,280
they are that's great

106
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,359
still implement those sanitation

107
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,800
protocols so that if there's any small

108
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
portion of pithing that tries to get

109
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
started your sanitation protocols

110
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,239
should take care of that to eliminate

111
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,560
the chance of you seeing that

112
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,480
in your subsequent crop particularly in

113
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,479
those indoor locations
