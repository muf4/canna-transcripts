00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,400
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,480
here i'm going to be going over and

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
showing you the basic steps to cannabis

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,280
cloning

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,240
so in a lot of videos i've talked about

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,160
some of the

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,519
methods you should go about doing when

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,880
you're looking at cloning

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,559
some of the process you should go

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,750
through but here i'm actually going to

11
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:26,320
show you

12
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:28,160
[Music]

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
all right let's get into the video here

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,480
where i'm actually going to show you the

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,960
basic steps

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,759
to cloning your cannabis plants hope you

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,200
enjoy

18
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,599
okay here i'm going to go over how to

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,440
take a cannabis clone we see

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,039
right here in our grow tent a nice

21
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,718
mother or stock plant

22
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,000
so things you need to keep in mind you

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,759
have your cloner already running which

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,799
it is and we'll see that at the end

25
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,359
stages here

26
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,799
i also have a beaker here of just some

27
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,519
water because we have to transport these

28
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,000
clones

29
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,440
want to try to reduce the chance of

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,679
stress on them so we're going to

31
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,358
get them right in that regular water now

32
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,600
some people will use a knife

33
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,520
you can use very sharp pruning shears to

34
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,519
go through and take our clone

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,439
so if we look here looking at this this

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,439
is the wife variety

37
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,559
or white strain looking at how we're

38
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:11,679
going to take a clone we want to make

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,799
sure we're always cutting at a

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,960
particular leaf

41
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,960
node we don't want to just cut randomly

42
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,438
halfway through in between the internode

43
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,798
area

44
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,039
we want to make sure we're cutting at a

45
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
node because one that will allow us the

46
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,040
maximum amount of

47
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
stem area but it will also allow us if

48
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,240
we take a clone right

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,239
here it'll allow us in the future to

50
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,839
take a future clown as well so we're

51
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,798
maximizing the cloning opportunities

52
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,359
that we get

53
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,118
so just looking at this one right here

54
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,319
probably gonna go right here

55
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:43,840
clip it right off that's gonna be our

56
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,798
wonderful little clone right there

57
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,280
take that we're going to submerge it in

58
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,200
the water here

59
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,799
again to keep it nice and hydrated

60
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,478
while we go to the next step so i'll go

61
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
through and take a couple more

62
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,759
the reason why i chose this specific

63
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,239
area here is if you look a little bit

64
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,239
closer

65
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,078
we can see right here where i took the

66
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,439
took the clone

67
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:08,959
that's going to allow this one to be

68
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,560
taken potentially in the future allow

69
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,959
this one to kind of grow out a little

70
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,239
bit more

71
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,759
so again here we can see the reason why

72
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,800
i took this here is this will allow this

73
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,719
one to grow out

74
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,680
and we can kind of look down this same

75
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,318
branch and maybe take another one

76
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,400
looking at this one being right here

77
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,719
here's another quality clone right there

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,280
stick this right in the water

79
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,959
keep that one hydrated and that's just a

80
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,479
quick example here

81
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
of now allowing this one potentially to

82
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,629
grow out and maximizing the productivity

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,699
we get from one single plant

84
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:43,698
[Music]

85
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,719
well that just gives you a little bit of

86
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,719
an idea there of the size of the clone

87
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,159
and speaks well to the health of the

88
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,439
mother or stock plant

89
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:59,439
right here

90
00:02:53,439 --> 00:03:01,359
[Music]

91
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,359
now looking at this branch right here we

92
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,440
can see there is a previous clone taken

93
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
and that now has induced a lot of these

94
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,039
side branches to form

95
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,480
so sometimes we want the clones a little

96
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,759
bit bigger in this case

97
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,079
looking at the stretching that they've

98
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,479
gone on and done we can probably take

99
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,159
many of these for clones right now so

100
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,199
i'm just going to go through and be very

101
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,239
precise with my

102
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,039
sharp scissors and take a bunch

103
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,519
of these cuttings that we're going to

104
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,919
clone

105
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,319
just tossing them in a beaker of water i

106
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,318
have prepared already

107
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,759
and again some of these might be on the

108
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,439
smaller side but always good to

109
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,798
experiment and see but that's

110
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,280
you know on the smaller side there

111
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,719
overall but again no complaints there

112
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
when we're looking at taking

113
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,479
a clone just want to make sure we're

114
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,080
putting that directly into some water

115
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,840
so it's not getting stressed before we

116
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,360
bring it over to our cloner

117
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,120
that just shows a great example of how

118
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
we took one and now we're getting a

119
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,878
couple more and i might leave that one

120
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,400
going forward but again a great way to

121
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,439
maximize your clones

122
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,280
from one plant

123
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,359
[Music]

124
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,360
you
