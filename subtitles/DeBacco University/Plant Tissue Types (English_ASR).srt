1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,009
okay I'm going to cover some basic plant

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:07,200
tissue types you see here we've already

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,990
talked about loss and flow ohms and

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,910
vascular bundles so the epidermis may

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:16,048
sound familiar but we're gonna score

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,509
some specific ones for plants so there's

7
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:20,160
three main types most plants have these

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,890
three main types what we call ground

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,230
tissue in which the vascular tissue is

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,210
embedded dermal tissue shortens the

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,640
outer protective covering of the plan

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,289
and vascular tissue which conducts water

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,299
and dissolved minerals of the plan

14
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,329
conducts products of the photosynthetic

15
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,369
process through the clamp so we can see

16
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,320
them here our xylem and phloem right

17
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,289
it's part of our vascular tissue the

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,000
dermal tissue doesn't like the epidermis

19
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,070
and the ground tissue is this middle

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,238
portion here and this is a cross section

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,549
of a plant's stem so three kinds of

22
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,349
plant ground tissues so we break that

23
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,968
down a little bit further this is a

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,789
great little summary here we've already

25
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,250
talked about phloem and xylem now we

26
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,859
look at some of these other types here

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,810
so parenchyma cells they're live at

28
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:10,019
maturity and they carry out the basic

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,100
functions of living of living including

30
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:16,739
the process of photosynthesis cellular

31
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:19,559
respiration and food and water storage

32
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,868
they have a very thin cell wall and

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,799
these are the parenchyma cells we

34
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:27,000
located down here and we see their

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,670
unspecialized cells that carry up most

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,069
of the plants metabolisms here moving on

37
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,618
we also have colon comma cells it's

38
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,359
mutated here they're also living at

39
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,519
maturity and they provide much support

40
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,039
the plants organs which secondary growth

41
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,868
has not occurred uneven thickening of

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,770
the cell wall see some are thicker some

43
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:49,319
are thinner regions it's the wall

44
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,509
thickened with pectin and cellulose so

45
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,379
but it's uneven in our clinic of the

46
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,899
cells they also function and support

47
00:01:54,379 --> 00:02:01,709
even though they are living the last one

48
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,649
of your cells way here are sclerenchyma

49
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:07,109
cells they usually do not contain living

50
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,969
cytoplasm immature may have tough cell

51
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,370
walls and secondary cell walls we see

52
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:13,859
the image here even thickening of the

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,770
cell wall and the walls the

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,060
with lignin so snoring chimera mainly

55
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,700
consisted of dead cells that have

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,520
primary secondary cell walls which

57
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,369
provides support so we could see our sky

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,460
rain come are very thick : come on very

59
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,810
uneven and think about containing kind

60
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,460
of those chloroplasts they're moving on

61
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,409
within our dermal tissue

62
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,540
it's a flattened at the dermal cells are

63
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,939
the most abundant cells in the plant's

64
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,620
outer layer or epidermis the epidermis

65
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,180
is often covering a waxy later called

66
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,860
the cuticle and that's a barrier against

67
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,020
water law so here's our cuticle is our

68
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,450
upper epidermis remember we don't want

69
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,790
our plants to dehydrate and burn so they

70
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:55,679
have this protective layer cuticle you

71
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:57,870
kind of think of like your nails cuticle

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,510
on your nails ah provides protection

73
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,550
same thing for here but in plants they

74
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:03,810
don't want to lose water ran way through

75
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,340
their leaves they want to control their

76
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,469
water loss through there's just no Matta

77
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,879
here

78
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:10,530
lastly the vascular tissue is

79
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,719
responsible for conducting water and

80
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,909
dissolved minerals of the plan conducts

81
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,489
products of the photosynthetic process

82
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,379
throughout the plant since they run

83
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,110
about way of saying xylem and phloem are

84
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,449
two examples members eylem is taking

85
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,700
water absorbed in the roots sending it

86
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,319
to the shoots the phloem can move from

87
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,089
the shoots to the roots the roots to the

88
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,419
shoots wherever it's basically needed

89
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:36,150
it's transporting sugars typically our

90
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,969
leaves are main sources and this flower

91
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,650
could be producing petals or a fruit and

92
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,060
that might need sugar so nutrients from

93
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,069
this leaf could be coming up to here

94
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,840
these roots could also be actively

95
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,299
growing and some sugars could be sent

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,700
down that way too so hopefully that's a

97
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,189
quick overview of some plant types take

98
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,719
a minute might want to in particular go

99
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,060
over review this slide to be able to

100
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,539
compare these different types of ground

101
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,539
tissues
