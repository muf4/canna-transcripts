1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,739
and this debaco University video I'm

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,139
going to go through an in-depth as well

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,280
as a field look at anthocyanins so I'm

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:10,500
going to give you an anthocyanin

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,199
overview I'll also look at genetic

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,298
regulation in field observations of

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,298
cannabis hopefully you enjoy

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,220
[Music]

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,660
so first off to give you a little bit of

10
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,219
the progression of information you're

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,018
going to find in this video I'm going to

12
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:33,299
go over basically what are anthocyanins

13
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,100
and provide you a basic background also

14
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,199
the regulation of anthocyanin and

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,059
biosisynthesis which gets into some new

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,040
insight into Gene regulation at the

17
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:43,140
molecular scale and then we'll go out in

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,700
the field for early season and

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,859
mid-season plant response to

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,260
environmental stresses that cause it to

21
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,000
increase anthocyanin production to be a

22
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,039
macroscopic view of how most Growers

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,579
will see or recognize anthocyanins I'll

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,100
provide you with a outfield look at some

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,378
recently transplanted cannabis plants

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,859
and Care will provide you with a late

27
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:06,840
vegetative growth anthocyanin look so

28
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,900
first of us let's start with the basics

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,180
and these Basics always here on debacle

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,580
University try to be science based so

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,260
here is an article I can take a look at

32
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,879
if you want to learn more about

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,118
anthocyanins and there'll be another one

34
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,259
referred to as well in this video so

35
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,239
first off again what are those

36
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,640
anthocyanins kind of what they look like

37
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,679
on a chemical structure but anthocyanins

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,140
are colored water soluble pigments which

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,200
are a class of flavonoids impart

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,118
pigmentation of the plant parts and play

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,759
an important roles and plant

42
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,819
environmental interactions these

43
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,400
components and compounds can also have

44
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,258
medical benefits as well you see a

45
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,640
couple of them kind of listed here and

46
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,560
again these are found more than just in

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,599
cannabis plants blueberries as well as

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,939
other fruits and vegetables can express

49
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,280
these as well

50
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,099
so again there's just also more than one

51
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,019
anthocyanin blueberries contained five

52
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,819
out of the six uh they're just missing

53
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,798
one there each has a different

54
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,438
coloration however the color is

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,959
influenced by the pH light temperature

56
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,060
and also the structure in general though

57
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,400
anthocyanins are red in acidic

58
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,080
conditions and blue when the pH is

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,459
increased it's going to give you an idea

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,800
of the general pH you can see all the

61
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,199
very similar structure but again some of

62
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,939
them are pH dependent can actually be

63
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,859
used as an indicator

64
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,739
so that color changing complexities here

65
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,780
color changes in response to pH

66
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:33,539
variation of the anthocyanins

67
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,520
this can be used as a pH indicator and

68
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,199
actually extract it from red cabbage to

69
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,939
actually take red cabbage and put it in

70
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:44,098
a blender and I take some of that water

71
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:45,539
out and then you add different PHS it'll

72
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:47,699
actually change color right before your

73
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,098
eyes and you can based on what color you

74
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,479
see can indicate what PH put it in

75
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:54,060
acidic solution it'll turn more the

76
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,399
pinkish reddish used if you put it more

77
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,319
in a slightly basic it could be more of

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,819
the purple if you put it in a more

79
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,339
extreme basic it could be more of a

80
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:03,780
yellow coloration so fun experiment if

81
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,719
you wanted to try it gets get some red

82
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,400
cabbage in a blender and some degrees of

83
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,098
acids and bases you can literally see

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,080
the color change as an indicator

85
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,238
uh with answer signings they also have

86
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,400
something called copigmentation so

87
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,200
copigmentation helps to stabilize the

88
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,180
color of the leaves flowers and fruits

89
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,859
of the plant this increased color

90
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,840
intensity can be due to the

91
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,580
co-pigmentation of anthocyanins and the

92
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,640
flavonoids here's a little bit more of

93
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,319
the detail here of copigmentation

94
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,119
there's metal ions that by the B ring of

95
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,919
the anthocyanins in this case aluminum

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,780
binding changes the anthocyanins from a

97
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,399
red to blue color so there is some

98
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,439
degree of complexity that can be

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,060
associated with this here we see a low

100
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,500
anthocyanin and the high of the sign of

101
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,239
production this is typically how Growers

102
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,340
are going to recognize it by simply the

103
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,920
degree of purple that they may see

104
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,200
expressed in their plants

105
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,479
now high temperature can also influence

106
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,579
the plant so anthocytes are less stable

107
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,419
at higher solution temperatures in the

108
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,420
plant

109
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,458
previous study the one who showed you

110
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:05,098
reports a heat treatment at a maximum of

111
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,400
35 degrees Celsius reduces the total

112
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:10,438
anthocyanin content in the common grape

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,260
to less than half the amount and control

114
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,419
berries that were kept at 25 degrees

115
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,000
Celsius so again we're talking about

116
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,500
stability of things anthocyanins kind of

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,959
if you increase the temperature too much

118
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,819
you can have that reduction on there in

119
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,620
total concentration

120
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,599
now heating it designs in the extract

121
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,139
solution so if we're looking at these

122
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,020
heat treatment of an anthocyanin and a

123
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,759
rich extract solution may not cause a

124
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,719
degradation of anthocyanin pigment so

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,360
it's important here that we're looking

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,880
at now the extract of the solution here

127
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,340
this is because the extract commonly

128
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,519
contains phenolic compounds that are

129
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:50,579
enzymatically degraded by phenyl oxidase

130
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,459
so in this example mild heat of the

131
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:55,859
extract to up to 50 degrees Celsius has

132
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,379
been shown to inactivate the enzymatic

133
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,020
reaction without the denaturing of the

134
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,120
enzyme the anthocyanin can be preserved

135
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:04,918
despite the increase in temperature this

136
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,019
is because if the endocytes are being

137
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,519
broken down by an enzyme if that enzyme

138
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:11,279
has the wrong shape and it can't perform

139
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,799
its function therefore it's denatured

140
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,019
well because the enzyme can no longer

141
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,540
break down the anthocyanin they can be

142
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:19,918
exposed to greater temperatures so

143
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,000
that's kind of like an interesting fact

144
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,519
there when we're talking about the

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,560
extract compared to the actual in the

146
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,240
plant content

147
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,740
now when we're looking at extracting

148
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,379
anthocyanins this can get quite

149
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,900
complicated um here but organic solvents

150
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,120
typically methanol and ethanol are

151
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,579
considered as generally safe extraction

152
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,379
medium isolation of antiscience using

153
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,478
water-based extraction though is Lex

154
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:45,079
toxic procedure and when it's being

155
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,939
implemented a little bit more frequently

156
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:51,300
this subcritical water-based extraction

157
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:54,839
uses acidified water with hydrochloric

158
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,639
acid to a pH of about 2.3 that is

159
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,859
subject to high temperatures we say high

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,800
temperatures will get between 110 and

161
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,379
160 degrees Celsius under a constant

162
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,300
pressure of 40 bars this is a highly

163
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,519
effective technique for extracting

164
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,960
anthocyanins from fruit and you can see

165
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:11,639
it does require some equipment but

166
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,239
really offers the

167
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,918
greatest extraction percentage of this

168
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,199
particular compound

169
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,000
now separation of xanthocyanins while

170
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,860
anthocyanins are extracted from Plants

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,319
as a crude mixture for that reason

172
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,840
separation or isolation of specific

173
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,240
types of anthocyanin is needed for a

174
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,099
specific purpose separation and

175
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,300
identification of anti-science can be

176
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,939
done via various chromatic methods here

177
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,579
so just kind of an example here hplc

178
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,939
high pressure liquid chromatography

179
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:46,379
liquid chromatography Mass Spec NMR

180
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,699
nuclear magnetic resonance there's a lot

181
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,899
of different methods and that kind of

182
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,120
will depend what might be looking at

183
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,679
separating or what degree of specificity

184
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,978
you might need whether it's a

185
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,060
qualitative or a quantitative method as

186
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:58,318
well

187
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,879
now getting in more into the

188
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,319
biosynthesis so if you want to learn a

189
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,538
little bit more about the hygiene

190
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,699
regulation here this is a relatively new

191
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:07,318
published article that just came out uh

192
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,660
really gets into some of the details

193
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,840
maybe not for the you know the grower

194
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,039
more morphological macroscopic view but

195
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,619
really this is kind of a breakthrough

196
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,959
that's going to help us out with the bio

197
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,978
Gene regulation of anthocyanin

198
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,500
production

199
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:24,719
so transcription factors the molecular

200
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,360
basis of anthocyanin biosynthesis and

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,300
Cannabis sativa remains elusive however

202
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,098
for this reason research still provides

203
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,918
information regarding the regulatory

204
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:36,598
genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis this

205
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,519
will be useful for biotechnological

206
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:39,899
improvement so even though this is just

207
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,000
kind of like a little bit of a glimpse a

208
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,439
little bit of an Insight this could

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,379
potentially be the research that

210
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,819
perpetuates this going forward

211
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,620
so why do we want to look at a

212
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,180
transcription Factor transcription

213
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,160
factors and what are transcription

214
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,500
factors they're basically proteins

215
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,380
involved in the process of converting or

216
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,779
transcribing DNA into RNA so we have

217
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:04,199
genetic codes in our genes and then

218
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,579
those DNA goes to RNA and that RNA is a

219
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,038
messenger RNA that will then get made

220
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,079
into a protein so transcription factors

221
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:12,899
include a wide number of proteins

222
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,818
excluding RNA polymerase that initiate

223
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,439
and regulate the transcription of genes

224
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,060
there's a really simple way to think

225
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,918
about it you think about is it's an on

226
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,360
off switch the description factor

227
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,279
determines whether that Gene is made or

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,220
that protein is produced or whether that

229
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,719
is turned off there and again it occurs

230
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,639
at the molecular level but it's a simple

231
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,259
on off transcription Factor yes make

232
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,459
that protein or no do not make that

233
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,860
protein

234
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,359
so why look at transcription factors uh

235
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,360
well they're important for Gene

236
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,860
regulation and also cell signaling one

237
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,839
distinct feature of transcription

238
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,580
factors is that they have DNA binding

239
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,740
domains that give them the ability to

240
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,740
bind to specific sequences of DNA called

241
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,120
enhancer or promoter sequences again

242
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,799
that promoter reach would be the area

243
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,299
that can be the light switch turned on

244
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,278
or turned off

245
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:59,039
as a result this all the direct impact

246
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:00,659
on the expression or the suppression of

247
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,399
this particular Gene so we see here if

248
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,259
there's an enhancer it's going to allow

249
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,620
this to kind of go through and progress

250
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,299
and allow that protein to be made or if

251
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,799
there's a silencer or a suppressor

252
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,379
that's going to prevent that or stop

253
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,778
that act as a wall of barrier turn that

254
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,519
off now our bodies that want to make

255
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:19,019
everything all the time so this this is

256
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,580
important to have this regulation but

257
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,519
here we're looking at it specifically

258
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,720
for this anthocyanin a biosynthesis

259
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,539
process

260
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,580
So within that there is the um myb

261
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:32,219
family for of transcription factors the

262
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,620
my B transcription factors abbreviate

263
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,778
TFS if I use that um preceding or

264
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,179
preceding this as one of the largest

265
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:41,220
Gene families in Plants it gets its name

266
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,319
from the myoblast

267
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,300
um came from the first identification of

268
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,940
these which was in avian oncogenes

269
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,919
interesting background there 203

270
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,680
identified nyp family transcription

271
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,479
factors have been found in eukaryotes

272
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,159
now they do play important roles in

273
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,080
biological processes well beyond what

274
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,480
we're going to look at here including

275
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,820
plant growth plant cell morphology

276
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,620
pattern building physiological activity

277
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,240
primary and secondary metabolite

278
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,339
reactors responses to environmental

279
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,379
stresses you could see involved in a lot

280
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,240
this family of transcription factors

281
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,000
plays a vital role in regulating

282
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,379
anthocyanin biosynthesis as well in fact

283
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,259
99

284
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:21,778
R2 R3 myb genes have been identified in

285
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,679
the Cannabis sativa genome alone here

286
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:24,838
we're looking at an example here

287
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,338
arabidopsis but we're looking now at

288
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,339
this article really making it more

289
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,920
specific to the canvas sativa plant

290
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,180
so what are these R2 R3 and YB genes why

291
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,399
are they you know why are we looking at

292
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:39,139
them and this is other previous

293
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:41,820
researchers did confirm that the

294
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,399
esmybf1 as a flavonoid specific

295
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,920
regulator which participate in the

296
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,639
biosynthesis regulation of the flavonoid

297
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:52,379
derived bioactive components now this is

298
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,078
looking at kind of that genetics which I

299
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,639
know can be look a little confusing if

300
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,259
you're not used to looking at charts

301
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,879
like this but just think of this as a

302
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,458
genetic sequences you're looking at the

303
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,259
genes or the coating the recipes to make

304
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,479
certain proteins

305
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:07,860
so these transcription factors are

306
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,539
widely involved in the secondary

307
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,579
metabolites of organic acids in

308
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:14,639
medicinal plants it's been found that

309
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:16,620
these R2 R3 myb transcription factors of

310
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,039
the fourth subfamily are involved in

311
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,620
metabolism of the female paranoid as in

312
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,139
negative regulator in various medicinal

313
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,000
plants what does this mean in short

314
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,220
we're looking at we're in that Gene

315
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,019
regulation we can choose to upregulate

316
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,300
or down regulate certain genes and now

317
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,940
we've kind of identified that marker

318
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,620
according to this published study

319
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,839
so into science Regulators are

320
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,578
identified based on the phonology as

321
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,579
well as the expression profiling of

322
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:46,979
genes in two areas here of the canvas

323
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,659
sativa differing in the content of

324
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,759
anthocyanin pigmentation in the sugar

325
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:54,078
leaves to punitive regulations of

326
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:58,620
anthocyanin biosynthesis named as a

327
00:11:54,078 --> 00:12:00,299
csmyb33 and csmyb78 were identified so

328
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,700
again we're identifying specific regions

329
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,919
within the cannabis plant based on This

330
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,019
research so that can really be utilized

331
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,299
now to start to Target or look for

332
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,600
certain sequences we can definitely see

333
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:15,359
that image B has more of that purple

334
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,000
anthocyanin regular upregulation than

335
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,700
does a plant a here

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,259
so they looked at similar plant so they

337
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,700
were looking at the transit

338
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:29,220
overexpression of these in leaves of a

339
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,500
close relative of tobacco and as

340
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,600
comparison it was founded there was a

341
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,360
stronger in terms of activation of the

342
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,920
anthocyanin biosynthesis so we're

343
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,899
looking at the certain genes looking at

344
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,078
a you know a cross comparison here

345
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,820
developing that analog there for

346
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,159
comparison we're definitely seeing this

347
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,139
in derivatives of cultivated tobacco

348
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,699
seeing that increased expression I think

349
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,060
just on the pictures alone you can see

350
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,620
that higher degree of purple coloration

351
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:57,719
that enhanced anthocyanin pigmentation

352
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,519
the leaves as well as the sepals the

353
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,139
transatic lines there so we're able to

354
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,820
modify those genes and we are seeing

355
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,919
that proof of concept with that

356
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,899
increased purple coloration

357
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,639
so this is a start so it's great

358
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,559
information but there is still limited

359
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,919
knowledge about the structural and

360
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:16,018
functional attributes of the R2 R3 mybs

361
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,240
in canvas sativa we can see that they

362
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,799
are found in other plants as well we're

363
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,839
trying to understand specifically in the

364
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,519
cannabis plant so I know there's a lot

365
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,860
of background information there so how

366
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,240
does this actually help a grower after

367
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,100
this in-depth investigation about

368
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,259
anthocyanins and hopefully you've tuned

369
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,060
in this long most Growers recognize this

370
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,799
as a purple coloration to their plants

371
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,599
often this is a result of an

372
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,159
environmental stress I'm going to show

373
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,480
you two examples of this plant response

374
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,639
I'm going to be out in the field early

375
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,259
season showing you plant shock showing

376
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,360
increased anthocyanin pigmentation in

377
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:47,458
the main stem of recently transplanted

378
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,440
seedlings and here is going to show us

379
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:52,199
increased anthocyanin production on Leaf

380
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,120
petioles indicated right here due to a

381
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,700
sudden increase in light exposure due to

382
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,560
the removal of a nearby plant's shading

383
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,540
so hopefully you've enjoyed this kind of

384
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,699
like background look detailed new

385
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,259
genetic look and now let's go out in the

386
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,778
field where you can also see this

387
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:08,519
comparison of different plants with

388
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:09,958
different anthocyanin levels of

389
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,820
production

390
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,500
now many Growers may think this is a

391
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,820
phosphorus deficiency when they first

392
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,399
look at it because they're seeing the

393
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,440
purple coloration of the stem and also

394
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,600
the leaves here but this just may be a

395
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,820
simple transplant shock plants about two

396
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,459
weeks in the ground here and you can see

397
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,700
that knowing the soil test has a

398
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:31,559
adequate amount of phosphorus so a lot

399
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,778
of times it gets misdiagnosed as a

400
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,939
phosphorus deficiency when in actuality

401
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:37,139
this might be simply a stress the reason

402
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,579
why I continue to say that if you look

403
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,320
at some of the newer growth towards the

404
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,059
top here you're noticing that's green

405
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,100
and yes there is some still stress kind

406
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,138
of towards the edge but it's a way the

407
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,000
plant can produce what's called

408
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:49,680
anthocyanins those anthocyanins shade it

409
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,480
from the sun because it is out here in

410
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,219
the middle of the field so this might be

411
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,320
just a perfect example of a little plant

412
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,639
stress that is not a nutrient deficiency

413
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,040
at all

414
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,379
So today we're outside investigating

415
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,778
this purpling on one of our cannabis

416
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,159
plant stalks the reason that this had

417
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,958
occurred in the first place is that

418
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,939
right where the camera was there used to

419
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,458
be a much taller cannabis plant growing

420
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,500
providing constant shade to this side of

421
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:16,619
the plant but suddenly because of bunny

422
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,679
damage it got taken down so in result

423
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,419
this plant received much more light on

424
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,179
this side than it was typically used to

425
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:27,479
resulting in this purpling pigment it's

426
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:29,099
like a sunburn but for a plant you could

427
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,079
tell it's a sunburn

428
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,500
because it doesn't occur on the other

429
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,239
side it's just where the light hits the

430
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,320
stem that it has this purple

431
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,778
pigmentation the anthocyanin come out

432
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,240
and create this purple pigment

433
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:47,220
and that's what causes sometimes

434
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,879
purpling within the stems of your

435
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,879
cannabis plant
