1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,799
so on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,359
going to go over the june nitrate soil

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,040
test

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,720
it's a great way to evaluate the

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,919
nitrogen in your soil which is

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,360
constantly changing

7
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,439
but this test is a good job of

8
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,919
evaluating that content

9
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,920
of nitrogen in your soil

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,160
[Music]

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,800
all right let's get into the june

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
nitrate soil test well looking at that

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,480
june nitrate

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,839
test here the june nitrate test also

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,039
goes by the name of

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,359
presidedress nitrate test or the psnt

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,679
it was developed in the mid-1980s and

18
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,399
was the first soil test for nitrogen

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,399
in humid regions like new england and we

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,359
typically see it associated with corn as

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,439
it is here

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,519
but it can be used for other crops as

23
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,198
well so keep that in mind that while

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
you'll see a lot of images or a lot of

25
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,878
correlation with it for corn

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,840
yes that was where it developed is from

27
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,119
but it is applicable to many other crops

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,879
the june nitrate test is commonly

29
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,479
associated with corn production but can

30
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,919
also be applied to other field-grown

31
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,840
crops so even though the images might

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,159
show you here the graphs for corn

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,840
again realize it is applicable so the

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,439
data generated from this test can be

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,240
applied to other crops and field

36
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,599
conditions

37
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,359
here we're seeing the soil nitrate

38
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,199
concentration in parts per million

39
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,118
and the relative corn yield we do see

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,000
this kind of like general this kind of

41
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:21,759
curve here where

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
if we increase our soil nitrogen

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,519
concentration much above that

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,159
region here we can see there's really

45
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,679
not that much uh increase in relative

46
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,920
corn yield at least on a percentage

47
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,360
basis so that june

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
nitrate the test is based on

49
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,200
concentrations of nitrate nitrogen or

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
no3n

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
in the soil sample when the soil nitrate

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,360
concentration is greater

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,118
than 25 parts per million the

54
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,759
probability of increased yield from

55
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,719
n fertilizer applied to the field is

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,478
very low

57
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,920
so this is why with that psnt test

58
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,319
depending what the values come back

59
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
as estimate nitrogen to apply in pounds

60
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,639
per acre

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,478
you could see that there are values and

62
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,519
that's typically above that

63
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,200
uh 25 parts per million range that no

64
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,359
additional nitrogen fertilizer would be

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,640
recommended see that here

66
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:11,120
if it's a net 21-24 about 10

67
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,119
a likely loss so expected yield response

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,120
consider side dressing with 20 to 50

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,840
pounds of nitrogen per acre

70
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,439
less than 21 we look at here other

71
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,840
specific guidelines that have presented

72
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,239
here but realize about 25 and above

73
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,680
really no need to apply any nitrogen

74
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,439
fertilizer

75
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
so what does this test provide well the

76
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,120
test provides an indication of how much

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,878
nitrogen will be available to the crop

78
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,400
during the growing season a little bit

79
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,239
more than just a point in time trying to

80
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,760
estimate during the growing season

81
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,759
it measures nitrate in the soil at a

82
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,039
point in time but makes estimations

83
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,199
going forward

84
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,639
sampling is time to match before corn

85
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,318
goes into the higher requirement for

86
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,318
nitrogen which is why it's commonly

87
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,000
referred to as the june nitrate test

88
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,679
and really for other crops as well

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,639
sampling in june would also be

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
recommended

91
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,839
the goal is to minimize the uncertainty

92
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,840
and make for when you're making those

93
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
fertilizer recommendations from the lab

94
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,959
however this test can be performed

95
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,560
during other months but typically in

96
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,120
june a lot of the labs offer their

97
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
quickest

98
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,959
turnaround time which can be very

99
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,640
important when you're collecting a

100
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,120
sample so it's kind of like a soil

101
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,119
sample

102
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,319
but slightly different because unlike

103
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,158
traditional mineral based

104
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,839
soil tests the june nitrate test soil

105
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,878
sample should be collected from the

106
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
surface

107
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,039
foot of soil so from the very top all

108
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,760
the way down instead of six to nine

109
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,519
inches down to 12 inches down

110
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,518
the sample should be placed in a paper

111
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,239
bag and got into the lab as soon as

112
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,000
possible

113
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,280
you do not want to put them in plastic

114
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,199
because that will

115
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,878
cause a nitrogen to react and not give

116
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,280
you a proper field

117
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,959
representative sample results are sent

118
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,158
to growers within 24 hours of being

119
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,759
processed by the lab

120
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:42,719
typically only during the month of june

121
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,158
and that's why it's simply called

122
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,519
junitrate test

123
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,280
this is because soil samples are

124
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,319
collected when corn is about 6 to 12

125
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,080
inches tall

126
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,679
and it's actively growing so farmers

127
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,200
need to be able to get into equipment

128
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
into the field if necessary

129
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,280
to add fertilizer before the plants get

130
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,759
too tall that's why the lab has such a

131
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,519
quick turnaround time when they can

132
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,120
so what is the optimum rate well

133
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,920
excessive would be greater than 30 parts

134
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,000
per million

135
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,280
optum is at 20 to 30 parts per million

136
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,799
and deficient would be under

137
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,878
20 parts per million of that nitrate

138
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,400
nitrogen knowing your field history and

139
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,560
keeping records can help you dial in

140
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
your nitrogen and maximize yields

141
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,079
while minimizing potential for

142
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,798
environmental contamination

143
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,478
and increasing your overall costs so

144
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,000
here again another recommendation based

145
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,359
on your soil nitrate level

146
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,959
looking at silage corn again but

147
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
applicable to other crops as far as how

148
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,159
much nitrogen should you

149
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,359
add and here we can see that there are

150
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,880
some indications

151
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,160
where you don't want to add any nitrogen

152
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,279
fertilizer because you're just not going

153
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,199
to get any return

154
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,638
on that investment hopefully that

155
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,439
explains a little bit more

156
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,800
about the nitrate test and how you have

157
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,399
to sample the first foot

158
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,840
get the lab as quickly as possible don't

159
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,839
use a plastic bag

160
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,519
and it helps determine your nitrogen and

161
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,560
in some cases you may not need to add

162
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,560
any nitrogen
