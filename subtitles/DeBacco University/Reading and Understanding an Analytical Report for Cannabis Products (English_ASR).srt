1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
for any products regarding cannabis that

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,359
you're looking at consuming

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,399
getting an analytical report is very

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,638
important

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,800
this video here in debaco university

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,518
though is going to provide you with uh

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,280
organized sequence of steps to go about

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,320
how to properly read as well as

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,160
understand

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,560
what those reports are actually able to

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,559
tell you

12
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:28,160
[Music]

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,000
all right so here we're going to go

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,199
about reading and understanding an

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,238
analytical report

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,320
for cannabis products it does apply to

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,679
a whole host of canvas products not just

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,920
dry flour

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,119
so what is this certificate of analysis

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,399
typically abbreviated

21
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,119
coa well cuas are a document generated

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,000
by

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,038
a licensed lab that shows the analytical

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
test results

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,198
on a cannabis sample these are used to

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
confirm the potency as well as the

27
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,159
purity

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,159
while also ensuring safety for

29
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,599
consumption and that's really important

30
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,119
be aware that some states may have

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,879
different testing requirements different

32
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,118
labs may have different layouts

33
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,478
but for the most part the generalness of

34
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,359
what i'll talk about here

35
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,159
will be applicable so first off why is

36
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,319
testing just

37
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,840
important just in general well it

38
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,319
provides the consumer

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,359
with a report that is transparent

40
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,399
unbiased

41
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,879
and ensures a safety safe product in the

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,320
end

43
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,000
so a lot of people will look at the

44
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,758
certificate of analysis go right to what

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the cbd or tht levels are and forget

46
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,519
about

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,118
the rest sometimes look at the terpenes

48
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,839
but there's a lot more information than

49
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,400
just those

50
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,560
that's important to be able to recognize

51
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,680
so first off verifying an analytical lab

52
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,600
report

53
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,439
so calling the lab that the product was

54
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,158
tested by and provide them with a

55
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,359
certificate

56
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,240
id we see a client id we see

57
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,519
names we see license numbers we see that

58
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,679
sample id

59
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,359
all these little numbers and letters and

60
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,439
kind of all are important

61
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,799
so provide with that sample id kind of

62
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,798
like right here

63
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,960
as shown on the particular analysis

64
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,079
which they use to verify the lab report

65
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,519
is authentic

66
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,438
you give them their sample id and they

67
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,840
should be to tell you you know the

68
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,118
grower or the client id or the date that

69
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,439
was tested

70
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,199
avoid anything that's listed as what's

71
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,199
called an in-house test

72
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,719
as this has a high potential for bias if

73
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,799
they're testing their own product

74
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,479
companies are more likely to skew the

75
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
numbers in their favor

76
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,318
third-party lab reports usually have

77
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
special markings on it which does not

78
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,479
allow others to duplicate

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
and often will have signatures also also

80
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,000
associated with them

81
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,280
so third-party lab testing well what is

82
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that kind of referring to why is that

83
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
important

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,680
third-party testing means that their

85
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,039
products are tested by labs that are not

86
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,519
affiliated with them

87
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,598
hence the term third party just because

88
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,879
the company mentions that it doesn't

89
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,679
mean you shouldn't look for the lab

90
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,039
report to analyze before purchasing

91
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,879
because any product

92
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,079
can just be tested so getting making

93
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,000
sure it's a third-party test

94
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,000
is important the whole purpose of

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
getting proc process

96
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
these products tested i should say by

97
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,959
third parties labs

98
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,840
is to show that the consistency of the

99
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,959
product contains the actual advertised

100
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,878
information

101
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,878
and also most of all the the

102
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,199
transparency is important

103
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,560
since growing a hemp and extracting cbd

104
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,878
is a complex process

105
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,800
it's critical to make sure that the

106
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,799
product of a consumer's purchasing is

107
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,080
safe for them to ingest

108
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,400
that's only possible with the

109
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,200
confirmatory results of a third

110
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,879
party test so with some common testing

111
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,479
terminology as i said different labs

112
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,719
might use different terminology

113
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,759
but you see the word the letters nd

114
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,840
typically refers to as non-detectable

115
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,959
this non-detectable means that it does

116
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,519
not mean it's not

117
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,840
present but it is not able to be

118
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,840
detected with the equipment being used

119
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
so it's kind of below detectable levels

120
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
now it could be zero

121
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
but it's below detectable levels a lot

122
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
of times you'll see a ppm that simply

123
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,798
stands for parts per million

124
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,640
blq is below level of quantification

125
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
denotes concentrations so small that

126
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,719
they do not meet the qualifying

127
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,120
threshold for cannabinoid content

128
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,400
then there's loq which is the limit of

129
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,080
quantification

130
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
this is the smallest concentration that

131
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,840
can be accurately quantified

132
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,280
lod is the limit of detection

133
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,280
and this is the smallest amount of

134
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,199
cannabinoid or cannabinoids that can be

135
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,720
detected by the instrument

136
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,478
unless we have loss on drawing that

137
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,479
might be stated and that simply tests

138
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,879
for the percentages of water content

139
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,159
in the final product so this gives you

140
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,918
some idea some of the terminology you

141
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,199
might see on these examples as well as

142
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,120
others

143
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,360
so let's get into the find the full

144
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,680
analytical report and this is on

145
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
the consumer's kind of shoulders there

146
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,240
many companies

147
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,720
post the coas of their products on their

148
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,400
website for all to see which is great

149
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,800
if a product does not have a coa

150
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,560
available it is advisable for consumers

151
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,120
to not buy that product and

152
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,120
is effectively untested usually the full

153
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,680
sale will not be on a product's label

154
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,840
but the potency testing will to view the

155
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
full coa consumers should be able to

156
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,039
find the qr code on the label

157
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,199
which should take them to the company's

158
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,280
website with the full coa and at the

159
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,240
very least if this is not possible

160
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,079
it should be available upon request any

161
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,160
consumers looking at purchasing anything

162
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,680
canvas related should request a coa and

163
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
it should be provided to them if it's

164
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,560
not

165
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,240
simply do i would not advise buying that

166
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,918
particular product

167
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,439
now the cannabinoid analysis again some

168
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,198
things that you might see well the

169
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,038
active ingredients in canvas should be

170
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,478
clearly labeled as it ensures that

171
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,719
growers can verify

172
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,240
the quality of their product so the

173
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
cannabinoid analysis that's where a lot

174
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,800
of growers will

175
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,478
consumers will look and that's great but

176
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
just keep in mind there is more than

177
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,279
just the cannabinoid analysis to take

178
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,400
into consideration

179
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,839
and again we're seeing some of those

180
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,679
levels uh those abbreviations mentioned

181
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,079
here they have microbial contaminations

182
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,879
so this uh is the bacteria mold and our

183
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,038
yeast

184
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,120
present in the sample predetermined

185
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,680
containment limits are established for

186
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
each

187
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,439
expressed in what's called cfu g which

188
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,440
stands for colony forming units per gram

189
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,360
colony forming units per gram

190
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,439
example limit would be less than 500 000

191
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,240
cfus per gram just as a random example

192
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,560
there

193
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,960
most test results simply list pass or

194
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,120
fail as a result meaning were they below

195
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,638
or above that threshold they're above

196
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
that threshold would be a failure

197
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,240
test and if they were below that

198
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,199
threshold they'd be getting a passing

199
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
mark there

200
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,478
and this keep in mind that just because

201
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,960
the sample may look clean

202
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,000
and looks moldy just because it looks

203
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,519
clean doesn't necessarily

204
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,478
mean it will still pass one of these

205
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,000
microbial tests or analyses

206
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,318
then there's aflatoxins which are very

207
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,759
concerning they're a type of mycotoxin

208
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,319
produced by certain types of molds and

209
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,319
fungi

210
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,479
they're very dangerous and have been are

211
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,360
potent carcinogens which you

212
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,719
uh which is why you want to identify to

213
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,680
ensure that your canvas has no

214
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,520
aflotoxins

215
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,840
in it to ensure that it's safe at least

216
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,599
for this particular category

217
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,959
then the terpene profile and analysis

218
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,319
and this is getting a lot of

219
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,159
popularity amongst consumers terpenes

220
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,800
are a set of simple organic molecules

221
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,360
present in

222
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,280
living organisms most of the flavors and

223
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
aromas of the plants derived from their

224
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,598
terpenes

225
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,240
you can find icing and diamond hops and

226
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,879
lemonade and citrus fruits as well as

227
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,360
other

228
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,120
terpenes are not unique to cannabis but

229
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,560
a lot of times provided in the cannabis

230
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
analytical report

231
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,839
plants produce terpenes naturally to

232
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,280
attract pollinators which is why it's

233
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,679
found in more than just cannabis

234
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,879
as well as to repair predators or

235
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,720
herbivores as well

236
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,079
so there are other advantages to the

237
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,759
plants producing these

238
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,598
in cannabis they've been selected for

239
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,038
the potential for different effects

240
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:31,038
or smells or aromas there's also heavy

241
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,360
metal testing analysis so cannabis can

242
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,598
be a bioaccumulator of heavy metals

243
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,598
these include but not limited to mercury

244
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,519
arsenic and cadmium and lead

245
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,639
any amounts of heavy metals present will

246
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,719
be listed here

247
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,960
and again just like the microbial test

248
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,479
these will simply reset at a pass

249
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,318
or a fail here so if it's below

250
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,639
detectable levels non-detectable

251
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,879
this status here would be a passing mark

252
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,439
for on the arsenic the cadmium the

253
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,240
mercury in the lead in this example

254
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,160
there's also pesticide analysis so this

255
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,400
is where the challenge with pesticide

256
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,840
residue or analysis in cannabis is the

257
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,878
concentration difference between the

258
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,038
pesticide residues and those

259
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,840
co-extracted cannabinoids and terpenes

260
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,318
here we're seeing units listed in the

261
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,758
ppb so ppm is parts per million

262
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,759
in this case there needs to be

263
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,800
sufficient sensitivity for these

264
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,400
uh pesticides to the detection to the

265
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,639
ppb or parts per

266
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,079
billion level so if they're going to be

267
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,199
present in really small

268
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,758
amounts here we're still seeing a

269
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,919
passing which is great but we have to be

270
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,918
mindful of using the parts per billion

271
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,038
unit when it comes to pesticide testing

272
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,639
analysis

273
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,080
and again now we see a great extensive

274
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,519
list provided here

275
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,278
simply can't test for every single

276
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,799
pesticide so a lot of the common ones

277
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,278
are provided here

278
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,879
but just keep that in mind that no lab

279
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,759
is testing for every single possible

280
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,439
pesticide

281
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,120
you want to see a comprehensive list and

282
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,519
of course a passing mark

283
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,159
for all of the pesticides tested or

284
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,600
listed

285
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,159
so they're all below the non-detectable

286
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,320
levels

287
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,679
to get a passing mark for the pesticide

288
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
test analysis
