2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:09,900
subscriber thank you here on YouTube so

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,539
subscribers didn't get names here chosen

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,669
the name subscribers to vacuoles kind of

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,099
sounds like molecules and it goes along

6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:20,129
with the education and scientific based

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,529
theme of the channel if you have

8
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:25,169
subscribed thank you and if you have not

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,939
it's not too late by all means go down

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,240
click the subscribe button and help

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,030
build this community what subscribing

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,129
means so it may seem to you just a click

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,140
of a button but provide a general idea

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,960
of the community centered around this

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,030
channel and well you and I think much of

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,558
it subscribing or not subscribing it is

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,629
much appreciated so if you have not

18
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,689
you're encouraged to take the time to go

19
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,549
through and do that information about

20
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:54,329
the channel while it is educational

21
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:56,339
based the videos tend to contain a lot

22
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,259
of clickbait and are probably not likely

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,020
to go viral but the intention is to

24
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,210
provide quality video content videos

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,100
have been used in high schools across

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,260
the United States and also in college

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,879
classes if you want to share where you

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,618
are watching this video series and add

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,379
to the comments below that would be

30
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,150
great to just see where these videos are

31
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,089
being watched it's always encouraging to

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,090
see positive comments within the

33
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,159
channels are very much appreciated it

34
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,478
can be hard to find good questions have

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,640
been asked and it's creating that sense

36
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,459
of community within the comment section

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,228
which has been great to see going

38
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,359
forward in the comments below you may

39
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:36,150
want to add what video topics you may

40
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,409
