1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
ever look at your cannabis plant stigmas

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,720
and wonder if that can help you

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,120
determine

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,000
how ripe or when harvest should be for

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,839
your plants

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,759
well here i'm going to go over on this

7
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,240
debaco university video

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,679
recognizing how to look at those visual

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,440
cues of those stigmas

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,800
to try to give you some indication of

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,920
how close you are

12
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,920
to peak harvest

13
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:30,000
[Music]

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,760
all right let's get into recognizing the

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
visual cues of cannabis plants

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,200
stigmas related to harvesting so first

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,239
off

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,239
early development so stigmas start out

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,599
as white and this is when they are the

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,119
most receptive to

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,800
pollen this is when you definitely want

22
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,359
to keep any male plants or pollen away

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,238
from them

24
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,920
because this is when they're most

25
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:48,558
receptive to pollen they're the

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,760
stickiest

27
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,280
so to speak they're the most the

28
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,640
freshest so the most likely try to go

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,320
through and capture

30
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,079
any random pollen grains that are

31
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,119
existing around them and i say they

32
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,119
start out white

33
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,718
some cultivar some varieties will kind

34
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,320
of have more of a slight different

35
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,879
coloration in this case a little pinkish

36
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,000
hue

37
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,399
if you will a rosy glow so most will be

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,159
white

39
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
but keep in mind there are some

40
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,320
variabilities and that's a great thing

41
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,399
to see

42
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,759
with the diversity of different types of

43
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
cannabis plants but there'll be this

44
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,040
kind of

45
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,239
lighter coloration now as we get into

46
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,040
kind of the progression

47
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,118
of those stigmas as they age they will

48
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,759
start to turn a kind of a blonde

49
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,280
brownish kind of tannish color and here

50
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,159
we can see some that are still in white

51
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,519
in coloration

52
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
we're starting to see some getting those

53
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,640
kind of like tannish brownish

54
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,719
colorations as well and this is a sign

55
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,400
they don't all do not turn at once

56
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,840
this is a sign of that progression that

57
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,159
aging that's occurring

58
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,600
becoming less receptive to pollen at

59
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
this point they're kind of like drying

60
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,359
out

61
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,719
and this is where growers will probably

62
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,200
be shifting over to these structures

63
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,599
which are

64
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,280
trichomes and i have a separate video on

65
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,679
that if you want to learn more about

66
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,040
looking at determining the peak harvest

67
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,719
looking at trichomes

68
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
so getting into that near harvest kind

69
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,839
of stigma color there

70
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,359
well as harvest gets closer the

71
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
percentage of the brown stimulus will

72
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,718
increase

73
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,280
to the point of nearly 100 percent i say

74
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,640
nearly

75
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,479
might have a couple that just kind of

76
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,639
like to stay white for whatever reason

77
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,560
but nearly 100 percent while this may

78
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,238
not be the main visual signal used to

79
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,719
determine the point of harvest

80
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,239
it can be a valuable indication of the

81
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,479
overall plant progress

82
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,920
towards peak harvest reason being yes

83
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,878
you can look at the trichomes typically

84
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,878
you need to have a little bit of a

85
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,359
magnify and kind of zoom in on those

86
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,719
but the stigmas here kind of provide a

87
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,599
quick if you're walking down an area

88
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,439
looking quick in an

89
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,039
area uh usually a little bit more of a

90
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,120
predominant structure there

91
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,079
and help give you that indication of the

92
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,840
progression

93
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,680
of the development of that particular

94
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,800
flower so you can make a comparison with

95
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,120
on the same plant

96
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,640
or within multiple plants to ensure

97
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,280
you're trying to hit that peak

98
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,759
harvest without getting any degradation

99
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,239
of the valuable cannabinoids or terpenes

100
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,239
that your cannabis plant might be

101
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,239
producing
