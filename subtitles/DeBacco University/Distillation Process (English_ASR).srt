00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,629
so when I have a title that says the

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,849
distillation process we might be

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,859
thinking of distillation centers in

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:10,649
alcohol here with like a moonshine

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,929
copper still or the distillation process

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,030
here or we're taking heated crude oil

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,240
and producing gasoline or diesel or fuel

8
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,919
oil and while these two steps are part

9
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,320
of the distillation process and it's

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,810
basically separating substances out

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,018
based on different boiling points we

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:31,368
relate this to distilling or purifying

13
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:33,210
water so the distillation of water

14
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:35,429
results from boiling water into vapor

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,859
and condensing it back into a liquid

16
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,929
however this boiling doesn't necessarily

17
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,659
need to always have occur we can simply

18
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:45,149
evaporate water and condensed it into

19
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,468
clouds and then have it rain and then it

20
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,939
gets them to our rivers and streams and

21
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,250
lakes and then gets evaporated again

22
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,589
this is a natural process of the water

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,969
cycle so the distillation process while

24
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,350
we can kind of speed it along with

25
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,020
boiling the water and turn it into vapor

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,250
this isn't natural occurrence that

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,780
occurs as part of the water cycle now

28
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,728
typically when we're looking at the

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,650
apparatus required to form distilled

30
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,719
water typically takes a high energy

31
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,740
input to lose a lot of heat involved you

32
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,349
can see what the copper stills

33
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:16,048
temperature monitoring even here on a

34
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:18,209
lab a lot of energy required to heat

35
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,680
that water to boiling as a result though

36
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:22,079
it doesn't take a lot of energy it's not

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
a very fast process but the event is it

38
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,390
does produce as close to pure water as

39
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,709
just about any system out there so this

40
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,430
is important to keep in mind if you're

41
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:34,530
really trying to get that pure on h2o

42
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:37,200
this distillation process would be one

43
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,090
worth considering to try to get that

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,520
close to pure water as possible in

45
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,329
removing any potential contaminants and

46
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,328
impurities
