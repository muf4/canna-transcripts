1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,919
going to be looking at testing cannabis

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,240
plant material for heavy metals

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:17,170
and some research articles surrounding

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:18,320
this particular topic

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,840
[Music]

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,920
all right let's get into testing canvas

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,920
plant material for heavy metals

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,960
so as always we have one scientific

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,960
article here

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
uh providing a brief summary on the

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,039
following slides as well as a couple

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,759
other

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,359
research articles we provided in this

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
video lecture

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,238
so starting with the basics here of

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,359
cannabis being used for

18
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,679
phytoremediation this fight over

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,280
mediation refers to the

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,878
procedures which employ plants to

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,679
scavenge heavy metals from the

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,199
environment

23
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,679
so we have soil that's contaminated with

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,520
heavy metals using plants phyto

25
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,600
to remediate or remove some of those

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
heavy metals this technique depends on

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
the ability of certain plant to

28
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:57,839
sequester

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,680
heavy metals from the soil so that when

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,239
food producing crops are planted

31
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,840
there ideally be no heavy metals in that

32
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,759
particular crop

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
so this kind of picture here kind of

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,439
simplifies it

35
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,759
metal embolization and toxicity is

36
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,319
reduced we're then taking up those heavy

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,079
metals

38
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,679
assembling them in the plant then

39
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,879
cutting down and removing this

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,799
particular plant

41
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,478
with an efficient way to kind of pull

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
the heavy metals out of the soil

43
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,679
heavy metals can be very difficult to

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,920
extract in the soil with other means

45
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
plants can be efficient at uptaking that

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,159
by removing this plant and discarding

47
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
that

48
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
essentially we've fight over mediated

49
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,359
we've used plants to remediate the soil

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,879
remove those heavy metals

51
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,959
take this plant material cut that off

52
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,839
site and that can allow us to

53
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,000
utilize this soil to be used for food

54
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,200
crops with very low chance of any heavy

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,078
metals accumulating

56
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,759
in those subsequent crops so we're

57
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,719
looking at heavy metal accumulation in

58
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,719
particular

59
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,319
so however this does lead to

60
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,000
concentration of heavy metals in

61
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,078
cannabis plants material

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
where they can later reside in products

63
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,599
derived from the cannabis plant

64
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,118
so that means that if we're using fiber

65
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,438
remediation with cannabis

66
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,718
which can be effective it is taking up

67
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:05,359
those heavy metals taking up those

68
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,879
pollutants

69
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,719
but can accumulate them not only in the

70
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,000
plant material but potentially

71
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,680
in end products that could be used it is

72
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,639
important to understand that some metals

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,560
are beneficial

74
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,799
essential for life others are highly

75
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,360
toxic and have negative effects on good

76
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,599
health

77
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,360
plants do need certain metals but

78
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,759
typically not the heavy metals like

79
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,720
zinc or high amounts of zinc i should

80
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,959
say cadmium

81
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,878
lead things like that cannabis has

82
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,239
good phyto-remediation properties

83
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,120
because they can remove heavy metals

84
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
from the soil

85
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,519
with minimal adverse effects so that's

86
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,959
what makes it great as a potential use

87
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,360
or potential good plant

88
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,878
to utilize in a phytoremediation process

89
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
we need to be cautious

90
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,560
because it can great at pulling those

91
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,000
out of the soil but it can accumulate

92
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,439
those in potential

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,840
beneficial plant parts so user exposure

94
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,598
to

95
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,519
heavy metals why are we so concerned

96
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,039
about heavy metals the user may be

97
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,640
exposed to unhealthy levels of

98
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,158
potentially toxic heavy metals by

99
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,000
smoking or other

100
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,158
produced cannabis products from

101
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,878
contaminated plant material

102
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,239
for other for user safety it has become

103
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,239
standard practice

104
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,158
to analyze cannabis plant material as

105
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,200
well as products derived from them

106
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,318
for a number of heavy metals we just see

107
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,158
here just heavy metals

108
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,518
in general where they could be generated

109
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,000
from industrial products

110
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,158
electronic waste could be direct contact

111
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,120
could be plants could be aquatic animals

112
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,759
could affect adults children and also

113
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,080
unborn

114
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,759
children in this case so what are the

115
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,840
heavy metals tested for

116
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,039
in typical uh most commonly they're

117
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,080
tested for is lead

118
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,079
cadmium mercury as well as arsenic

119
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,360
however depending upon which state is

120
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,519
involved this

121
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,879
this testing list of heavy metals might

122
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,000
be longer

123
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:49,199
so just keep that in mind these aren't

124
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,639
the only heavy metals these are the

125
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,438
typical common four

126
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,559
others may have more stringent standards

127
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,719
so what's the analysis

128
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
techniques we're looking at heavy metals

129
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,400
icp

130
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
either the oes or the ms are techniques

131
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
capable of measuring

132
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,039
multiple elements simultaneously and are

133
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,120
this preferred methods where multiple

134
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,359
or multi-heavy metal measurements are

135
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,319
desired and is regarded to have the best

136
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,720
sensitivity and is the method used in

137
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:16,798
many

138
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,519
modern laboratories so this is a good

139
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,078
thing we're not just testing just for

140
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,160
arsenic or just for lead we want to test

141
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,800
multiple these so the icp is a great

142
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
method

143
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,478
for that the food and drug

144
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:32,000
administration fda and

145
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,439
the usp united states of pharmacopia

146
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
have standardized methods for heavy

147
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,160
metal analysis which are very useful

148
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,919
resources

149
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,080
in the emerging cannabis industry where

150
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,079
regulation has been a bit slow

151
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,279
to kind of catch up so we're kind of

152
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,478
getting into the regulations of heavy

153
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,599
metal testing and

154
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,599
cannabis products because we want to

155
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,800
make sure the test we're getting is an

156
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,280
accurate representation of what is or is

157
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,840
not

158
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,638
in that plant so this is looking at

159
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,638
another

160
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,560
research article but really just at the

161
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,680
abstract because only the abstract was

162
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,199
publicly available

163
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,439
but again welcome to look at this

164
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,360
looking at the mycorrhizae comparison

165
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,719
and metal accumulation changes in

166
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,800
cannabis

167
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,039
so what did the study investigate well

168
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,560
the effect of mycorrhizae on heavy metal

169
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,599
uptake and translocation was

170
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
investigated in

171
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,520
cannabis plants hemp has grown in the

172
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,720
presence and absence

173
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,439
of 100 micrograms of cadmium

174
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,800
and nickel and 300 micrograms of

175
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,038
chromium

176
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,918
sex here and inoculated or with the

177
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,599
fungus glomerulus mosaics so what is

178
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,319
mycorrhizae just in general as a quick

179
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,080
summary

180
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,439
well here we have our plant here we have

181
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,758
our roots

182
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,879
not no colonization no mycorrhizae we

183
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,520
just see the roots

184
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,199
kind of being able to produce certain

185
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,758
extra dates being able to uptake

186
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,319
whatever is immediately surrounding them

187
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,319
the advantage of mycorrhizae

188
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,120
associations with those roots is it

189
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,159
expands

190
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
the net or the network that these roots

191
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
have

192
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,038
they're able to get basically water more

193
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,439
efficiently

194
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,240
as well as other nutrients more

195
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,439
efficiently

196
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,439
simply because there's a greater

197
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,160
exposure of surface area

198
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,560
to the soil environment to that root

199
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,039
zone

200
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,839
compared to those that are not they do

201
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,240
not have an association with mycorrhizae

202
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,359
so we look at mycorrhizae colonization

203
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,319
hemp growth was

204
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,720
reduced in inoculated plants and the

205
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,360
reduction was related to the degree

206
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,919
of microvisit colonization the

207
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,479
percentage of microscopination was 42

208
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,560
and 9 and plants grown in

209
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,800
non-contaminated and contaminated soils

210
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,639
this suggests a significant negative

211
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,840
effect of high metal concentrations on

212
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,800
plant infections

213
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,519
by the mycorrhizae fungus keep in mind

214
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,079
soil ph

215
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,000
metal bioavailability and plant metal

216
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,399
uptake were not influenced

217
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,439
by the presence of this mycorrhizae

218
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,198
association

219
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,879
now when i say this is a fungus it is a

220
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,720
very small fungus well it looks very

221
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,918
large on the pictures here

222
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,720
it does work with the plants

223
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,318
you can visually see it here we as we're

224
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,720
stained but we can visually see the

225
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,360
vesicles in the hyphae of the fungus

226
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,199
it's a symbiotic relationship so the

227
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,680
fungus is getting more nutrients

228
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,280
and in this case metals for the plant in

229
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,199
exchange the plant provides sugars

230
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,279
so the fungus can more easily grow and

231
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,000
have a food source

232
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,559
so microarrays enhances translocations

233
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,680
more of the specifics of that study

234
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,918
plants grown in artificially

235
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
contaminated soil accumulated most metal

236
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,598
in the root organ

237
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,680
so the root region in this soil

238
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,519
microzations significantly enhance

239
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,199
though the translocation of all three

240
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,359
metals from the root

241
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,840
to the chute so that's a very important

242
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,720
point that microsay

243
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,519
is great at accessing different parts of

244
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,520
the soil

245
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,719
accumulating those metals but what they

246
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,959
noticed was that

247
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,639
the in the soil that had the

248
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,758
microorganism added to it

249
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,160
there was enhanced or improved more

250
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,400
translocation more movement of all three

251
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,800
metals from just the root environment

252
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,839
up into the shoot in upper portions of

253
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,199
the plant

254
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,439
the possibility to increase metal

255
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,319
accumulation in shoe is very interesting

256
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,639
for phyto

257
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,080
extraction purposes since most high

258
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,639
producing biomass plants

259
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,399
such as non-mycorrhized hemp retain most

260
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,639
of the heavy metals in the roots

261
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,560
limiting their application so this

262
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,639
translocation is a very

263
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,839
important kind of discovery here as far

264
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,038
as being able to move

265
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,119
those nutrients from just the root

266
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,918
environment up into the upper portions

267
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,439
of the plant

268
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,120
and we see that here on this diagram

269
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,559
where we're seeing kind of the heavy

270
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,479
metals and we're seeing them being

271
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,319
translocated up here

272
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,839
and transported to upper portions of the

273
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,200
plant now here's another research

274
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,800
article a little more current than

275
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,320
the last one that looks at the

276
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,439
non-essential heavy metal contaminants

277
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,040
in industrial chemist

278
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,560
bioeconomy so they looked at kind of

279
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,399
mitigation of heavy metal uptake

280
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,119
suggestions how to kind of reduce the

281
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,480
ability

282
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,399
for heavy metals to be uptaken and

283
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920
translocated through the plant

284
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,919
they recommended avoiding the use of

285
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,199
mycorrhizae the previous study shown

286
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,439
which i just discussed

287
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,560
showed enhanced translocation of cadmium

288
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,800
nickel

289
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,000
and chromium-6 from the roots to the

290
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,479
shoot of cannabis

291
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,159
so it helps move those heavy metals into

292
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,320
the upper portions of the plant

293
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,240
which is something ideally we really

294
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
would not want to have happen

295
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,759
and keep it in the roots remove that

296
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,039
plant perfectly fine but as it gets into

297
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,720
those upper portions

298
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,719
can get into other vital plant

299
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,120
components

300
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,839
other suggestions that they provided

301
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,480
here was

302
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,160
they avoid the use of echo of bacteria

303
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,920
which is another trigger

304
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,319
for increased uptake of cannabis

305
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,599
associated with this strain has been

306
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,920
shown to

307
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,000
committedly enhance plant growth

308
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,958
accumulation of cadmium in zinc and

309
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
fiber plants

310
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,639
this is another additive another

311
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,600
bacteria that can help

312
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,480
increase the uptake and translocation of

313
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,560
heavy metals

314
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,800
in the soil so avoid inoculation of that

315
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,639
also want to be monitoring the field so

316
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,278
the farmer must perform a robust soil

317
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,278
test

318
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,519
as well as monitoring field conditions

319
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,240
such as field soil ph

320
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,919
weather conditions related to rain water

321
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,240
or irrigation water

322
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,599
irrigation water ph's and things like

323
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,278
that are also things

324
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,639
that should be monitored and carefully

325
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,919
monitored

326
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,720
and as i mentioned those ph

327
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:21,199
modifications for

328
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,040
injection in irrigation water cannabis

329
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,160
is acephilic

330
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,240
and basically in the uptake of

331
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,480
lead and mercury and plants occurred at

332
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,799
ph below the level of six

333
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,159
thus ensuring that the ph stays above a

334
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,479
6.5 level

335
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,679
and all chemo injection practices can

336
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,480
mitigate lead

337
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,919
and also mercury absorption in the soil

338
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,680
so when we say chemo injection this is

339
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,838
like growers who are looking at

340
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,719
fertilizing with water fertilizing with

341
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,120
water that has

342
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,879
fertilizer added to it the suggestion

343
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,679
here is to keep that ph above

344
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,399
6.5 to reduce the uptake and absorption

345
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,078
of lead in mercury by cannabis plants

346
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
and then the last mitigation heavy metal

347
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,359
uptake that they suggested

348
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,120
would be coupling ozone water treatment

349
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,278
with water softener system

350
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,919
ozone water treatment could help oxidize

351
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:11,360
these heavy metals in irrigation water

352
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,919
and coupled i ionized system with

353
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,399
a water softener system could help

354
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,078
remove oxidized forms of heavy metals

355
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,399
before they're delivered to the cannabis

356
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,719
crops so just another way to mitigate or

357
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,799
reduce the amount of heavy metal uptake

358
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,240
so heavy metals are a great concern

359
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,958
cannabis is a great

360
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,600
potential use for phyto remediation we

361
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,838
have to keep

362
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,920
in mind of the factors that cause the

363
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,600
translocation of these heavy metals

364
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,039
and limit the use of those upper

365
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,800
portions of the plant

366
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,319
as well as any plant material grown

367
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,679
indoors or outdoors

368
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
making sure we're getting proper

369
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,559
analytical tests that test for the

370
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,239
presence of these

371
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,639
heavy metals and making sure we're

372
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,440
staying below any thresholds that are

373
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,439
set
