1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
okay here we look at population

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:09,210
demographics and what we see pictured

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:12,150
here is a population pyramid and it goes

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,000
over and it shows the number of

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,490
individuals in a certain age of the male

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,320
and female gender here in this case this

7
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:22,409
is representing the u.s. population for

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,969
the year 2010 so we're gonna look at

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,730
some of these and understand a little

10
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:29,759
bit more about what this may show us so

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,740
first off population demography well the

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,620
demography is it statistical study of

13
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:36,899
populations there must many people and

14
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:39,179
graphically a measurement so it's a

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,289
measurement of people and we may be

16
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:42,719
familiar with kind of the world

17
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:45,149
population here in billions I and the

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,980
exponential growth that we're in and is

19
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,350
it going to continue at high rate

20
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,869
continue at a medium rate or low rate

21
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,719
erection to grade is the question here

22
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,939
that we're looking at so this study

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,058
helps us predict how population sizes

24
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,608
will change going forward and the growth

25
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,890
rate is sensitive to the sex ratio it's

26
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,170
the males to females and the age

27
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,728
structure how many young people how many

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,070
older people and how many middle-aged

29
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,859
people so if we look here at the world

30
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:16,529
here well the sex ratio the portion of

31
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,140
males to females in a population is the

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,090
basic definition of this the number of

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,040
births is usually directly related to

34
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,770
the number of females is they're the

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,009
ones that convert children so we see our

36
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:30,899
map indicating here while blue indicates

37
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,409
countries with more females than males

38
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,540
we see that it here countries with the

39
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,490
same number of males or females are in

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,549
green and countries with more males and

41
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:43,289
females are in red there and note it is

42
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,780
here so this can be a little misleading

43
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,729
when we see some of these large areas

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,920
I'll remember this is just looking at

45
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,750
the country isn't saying that there's a

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,090
definite border here it's looking at

47
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,069
just the sex ratio of the different

48
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,049
countries we can see a definitely a

49
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:00,539
general trend here of these countries

50
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,880
having more males and females and in the

51
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,368
United States here and North America

52
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:09,840
overall having more females than males

53
00:02:07,368 --> 00:02:11,969
the gender gap and in the other child

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,629
sex ratio overall there are more males

55
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:15,310
and females in various

56
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,079
Indian states particularly in the

57
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:22,539
northern area where they're going to be

58
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:25,450
as many as 125 to 130 males to female to

59
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:27,849
100 females what are some of the

60
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:29,799
long-term impacts overall population of

61
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:32,829
this country so in the country that has

62
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,810
this many more males than females how is

63
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,800
this going to impact different areas and

64
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,530
that's the thing we need to think about

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,060
and when there's a gender gap these are

66
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,879
some of the questions that are generated

67
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,670
and as the impact it can have on that

68
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,289
country in the long term

69
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:50,530
now the gender gap in the worldwide view

70
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:53,769
here looking at gender equality here

71
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,379
again in red we have a larger gender gap

72
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,290
and in green we have a less gender gap

73
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,719
there gender gap of one would be

74
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:03,069
incomplete equal here and we could see

75
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,870
here the different countries where there

76
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:09,699
is a greater gender gap where that is

77
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:11,890
existing based on 2013 data and this

78
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:15,280
gender imbalance is very evident in

79
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:17,529
China where it's in 1982 and the

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,979
ultrasound was widely available we see

81
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:24,759
now an increase in the number of males

82
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:27,369
present in 2012 for every 100 girls born

83
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:31,000
there were a hundred and sixteen boys

84
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,580
born here now this Chinese gender

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,680
imbalance problem the gap may not look

86
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:40,420
large but it represents a gender gap of

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,400
about 34 million women in 2011 there so

88
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,619
there's a lot more males than there are

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,209
females despite our growing population

90
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:52,450
here overall in billions is uneven there

91
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:55,610
are more males than females there

92
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:57,500
just a general population demographic

93
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:01,730
well in Singapore

94
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,009
I hear we have a poster that says 1 2

95
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:06,919
and that's ideal the goal here was to

96
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:10,189
try to limit the amount of population

97
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:13,068
growth that may occur and on the picture

98
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:15,739
here countries at by birthrate those of

99
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:17,988
the brighter collaborations here we're

100
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:19,370
seeing births per thousand and

101
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:21,679
population we're seeing a lot higher

102
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,290
birth rate in the countries here of

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,910
Africa so the age structure as I

104
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,639
mentioned cohort is a group of

105
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,250
individuals of the same age with

106
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:34,100
characteristics birth rate of London C

107
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:37,220
is the number of offsprings born in a

108
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,139
standard time that directly relates to

109
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,060
the death rate or mortality or looking

110
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,680
at populations here it's the number of

111
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:47,269
individuals that die in that same period

112
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,879
the relative number of individuals in

113
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:51,500
each current defines populations age and

114
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,750
that goes back to the first image we saw

115
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,079
with the bars who are looking at the

116
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,569
number of individuals of male and female

117
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,728
sex ratio there how many occur in

118
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:03,949
particular population so the birth

119
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:06,560
weight is the number being born death

120
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,389
rates number dying off how these relate

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,339
to one another will determine a

122
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,340
populations demographics
