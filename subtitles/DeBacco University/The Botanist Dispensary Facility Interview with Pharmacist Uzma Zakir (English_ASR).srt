pharmacist osma Zakir we're going to ask

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,020
her a little bit about herself about

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,420
questions about the botanist their

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,340
educational Outreach some misconceptions

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,079
that people may have and just other

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,780
general information about being a

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,820
medical patient over at the botanist

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,039
so good morning thank you so much for

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,079

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,939
start just introduce yourself give us a

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,619
background tell us what you do here sure

22
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,659
thank you so much for having me my name

23
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,339
is azma zakar and I'm a pharmacist and

24
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,500
I've been a dispensary pharmacist since

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,079
2015.

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,500
um where we get to treat patients using

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,079
marijuana as their medicine it's been a

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,118
very very rewarding experience and it's

29
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,920
amazing to be a part of something that's

30
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,920
evolving and progressing so quickly

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,020
at the botanist we really pride

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,420
ourselves in our education department

33
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,938
where we do keep up to date with the

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,379
current cannabinoid research really

35
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,118
keeping close relationships with the

36
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,938
Growers and understanding their products

37
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,340
and then putting that together to really

38
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:33,658
see how much this plant can do for us

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,478
and it's been such a remarkable

40
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,460
experience to see how much patients

41
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,039
improve when they do get their medical

42
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,658
marijuana card and work with us thing so

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,759
how would somebody get started in the

44
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,920
process of becoming a medical patient at

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,959
the bottom so it is a two-step process

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,240
so first your doctor has to determine

47
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,859
that you have one of the 38 qualifying

48
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,719
conditions and then your doctor will

49
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,000
enter your certification into the state

50
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,420
system then the patient completes an

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,938
online application where your Val you

52
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,700
need a valid government-issued ID as

53
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,379
well as well as proof of residency and

54
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,659
that can be a little complicated so we

55
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,978
do help patients by appointment to help

56
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,139
them complete that part of the

57
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,940
application that's great of you guys to

58
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,439
do is there anything that patients

59
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,300
should keep in mind while going through

60
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,159
this process yeah there is a hundred

61
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,739
dollar fee to the state that we

62
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,299
currently reimburse to our patients can

63
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,739
you describe the different delivery

64
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,719
methods and how someone could best

65
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,580
utilize each of them yeah absolutely

66
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,039
it's really great that we have such a

67
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,099
wide range of Delivery Systems because

68
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,780
it can really the program can really get

69
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,598
tailored for a patient's individual

70
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,300
needs so there's of course flour to

71
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,919
smoke and there is vaping products after

72
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,300
that there's so many choices which is

73
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,219
great because many patients come to us

74
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,200
they don't want to smoke or vape and

75
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,300
they can still get the full benefit of

76
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,280
the program using things like oral

77
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,800
Solutions which are like dropper bottles

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,259
tablets capsules there's baked goods

79
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,660
there's even topicals which can help

80
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,679
with a whole range of conditions it's so

81
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,419
great that there's so many different

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,620
ways to go about that it is really great

83
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,780
because everyone has their own

84
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,340
individual needs and really

85
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,500
understanding and I think my favorite

86
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,120
part about what I do is just talking to

87
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,219
patients understanding their lifestyle

88
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,840
and really getting an idea of what's

89
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:17,098
going to work for them to empower them

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,319
and just give them the right Tools in

91
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,959
their toolbox and Delivery Systems are

92
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,598
really important because also the

93
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,519
delivery system determines how quickly a

94
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:28,679
medication is going to take effect and

95
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,480
also how long the duration of action is

96
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,819
how long it's going to last so it's

97
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,219
really nice to to tailor very

98
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:37,560
specifically for each patient

99
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,780
what are cannabinoids and how do they

100
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,640
differ from turkeys so cannabinoids and

101
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,180
terpenes are from two different families

102
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,798
of molecules so cannabinoids are the

103
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,420
molecular components of the cannabis

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,760
plant that actually makes cannabis

105
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,878
medicine so it works physiologically in

106
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,378
our body with our endocannabinoid system

107
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,298
terpenes are aromatic compounds that

108
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,939
actually exist in all plants fruits and

109
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,920
vegetables so for example Lavender is

110
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,919
very high in linole which sort of makes

111
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,378
lavender very relaxing the most common

112
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,899
terpenes found in the cannabis plant are

113
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:12,419
betamercine beta-cariathylene linole

114
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,640
limonene and pinene and in Connecticut

115
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,379
they're measured and they're on they're

116
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,019
on the product labels and that really

117
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:20,339
help us give us an idea of how a

118
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,358
particular Harvest is going to make a

119
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,579
patient feel

120
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,839
what are some general precautions and

121
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,519
warnings that you would give to your

122
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,560
patients prior to coming here and

123
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,359
ordering yeah I would definitely say

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,519
make that consultation with your

125
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,900
pharmacist so all of our locations have

126
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,459
really great medical cannabis

127
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,500
pharmacists that are here to help you

128
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,779
and assist you because we're pharmacists

129
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,639
we also understand your medications from

130
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,500
your from your regular doctor and your

131
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,879
pharmaceutical medication so we can go

132
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,319
through your regular medication list

133
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,379
make sure that there's no drug

134
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:54,319
interactions and then introduce cannabis

135
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,319
safely into your medic medication regime

136
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,800
if you have never used cannabis before

137
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,599
that's totally okay we have lots of

138
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,220
different products that have no

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,300
psychoactive effect if that's what

140
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,419
you're looking for but you're still

141
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,699
looking for that relief and so really

142
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:14,159
starting off with low doses speaking to

143
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,199
your pharmacist on how to safely titrate

144
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,939
up and explore different options and

145
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,680
different regimens so that's what makes

146
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:22,199
medical cannabis unique is that you have

147
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,000
a guide and that's what I love doing the

148
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,500
most is getting to know the patients

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,180
getting to know what they need and what

150
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,459
they're looking for and then being able

151
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:33,379
to set them up on something to empower

152
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,379
them on on getting better

153
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:41,519
hi everyone it's Kiara

154
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,978
um I'm here to talk about my story being

155
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,258
a medical patient at the botanist so

156
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:48,478
when I first qualified to get my med

157
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,460
card I thought it was pretty difficult

158
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,519
to find really a home base for a

159
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:56,038
dispensary because a lot of places are

160
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,978
pretty variable with their products with

161
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:01,259
their customer service hours but I find

162
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:02,579
that the botanist is very consistent and

163
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,439
that's what I really like about this

164
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,899
place is that there's always great

165
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,939
customer service I'm in and out pretty

166
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:12,060
quickly you know it's quick but not

167
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:14,839
hurried a lot of these products here you

168
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,240
can see that they have lab testing for

169
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:20,219
microbiology micro toxins having Metals

170
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,079
pesticides which of course are not

171
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,479
things that you want to be consuming and

172
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,978
so it's really great to know right on

173
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,500
the bottle that you're not getting any

174
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:30,478
of that in your product in my opinion

175
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,519
one thing that really sets the botanist

176
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,439
apart from other dispensaries is how

177
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,939
informative they are to their customers

178
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,038
you don't have to worry when you come to

179
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,418
the bottom cause they will let you know

180
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:41,459
exactly what you're going to get

181
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:43,379
yourself into there's no confusion they

182
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,180
have so many options here and I just

183
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,740
really love how transparent they are

184
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,038
with everything and how helpful they are

185
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,560
as a dispensary in general so that's why

186
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,918
I always come back to the botanists no

187
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,300
matter where I go it seems

188
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,978
so here at the botanist we really

189
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,960
understand the endocannabinoid system

190
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:03,959
and the science behind cannabis's

191
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,339
medicine so the endocannabinoid system I

192
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,019
really like to take the time out to

193
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,719
explain to patients why we're why

194
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:12,538
cannabis works as medicine and it's

195
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,039
really amazing to see patients when they

196
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:15,839
realize that just like we have a

197
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:17,519
cardiovascular system or an endocrine

198
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:20,818
system we also have an endocannabinoid

199
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,439
system that the molecules in the

200
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,000
cannabis plant that make cannabis

201
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,800
medicine are called cannabinoids and we

202
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,079
call them phytocannabinoids because they

203
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,819
come from a plant but lo and behold the

204
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,500
human body actually makes its own

205
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,120
versions of these cannabinoids and

206
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,120
they're called endogenous cannabinoids

207
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,160
because they come from the inside so the

208
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,800
two most prominent are anandamide and

209
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,780
2ag and anandamide was actually named

210
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,579
after the Sanskrit word for Bliss or

211
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:47,279
Supreme Joy

212
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,659
so how do these work in the body well

213
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,538
they work like a lock and key on our

214
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,340
cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 so the

215
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,259
cannabinoid one receptor is actually the

216
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,818
most prevalent receptor in our central

217
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,560
nervous system that means you have more

218
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,000
receptors for cannabinoids in your

219
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,978
central nervous system than for anything

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,740
else that's a really phenomenal

221
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:06,300
statement and the cannabinoid two

222
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,918
receptors are mostly found on your

223
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,860
immune system your tissue cells your

224
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,659
organs and even in your skin so what all

225
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,098
what are all these compounds doing we've

226
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,900
got these receptors and we even have

227
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:17,639
enzymes that work on the endocannabinoid

228
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,159
system and we have our endogenous

229
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,180
cannabinoids well scientists put it all

230
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,939
together they named it the

231
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,038
endocannabinoid system and it is really

232
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,319
a complex molecular signaling system

233
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,120
that really helps to regulate almost

234
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,860
every physiological function in the

235
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,200
human body and that's why when you look

236
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,360
at a state qualifying conditions list

237
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,759
there's so many different types of

238
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,219
illnesses so you're looking at something

239
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,200
like ALS which is neurodegenerative or

240
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,720
neuroinflammatory but then there's also

241
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,899
PTSD on the list there's also Crohn's

242
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,420
disease on the list so how this explains

243
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,039
the endocannabinoid system explains why

244
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,419
one plant is good for so many different

245
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,879
disease States

246
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:59,338
so the cannabinoid two receptors on our

247
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,200
immune system is really what helps

248
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,600
modulate inflammation and why

249
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,640
cannabinoids are such potent

250
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,440
anti-inflammatories and then with the

251
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,299
cannabinoid one receptors if we just

252
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,620
look for an example of like pain for

253
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,139
example in our central nervous system

254
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,419
it's actually been shown in studies that

255
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,399
are cannabinoids actually modulate every

256
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,439
step of the pain processing pathway in

257
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,000
the human body so that's ascending

258
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Pathways descending Pathways and the

259
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,659
cannabinoids are there playing a part in

260
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,160
all of it so again it's just so much

261
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:29,278
potential for the plant the more you

262
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,458
learn the more you want to help people

263
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,320
you know I work with patients who have

264
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,179
who suffer from fatigue because of some

265
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,620
of their illnesses so it could be an

266
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:40,500
autoimmune arthritis it could be

267
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,200
fibromyalgia but fatigue is a top

268
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,059
symptom or cheat complaint for them and

269
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,259
what's really remarkable is when you

270
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,819
start working with patients and you get

271
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,500
them to sleep properly through the night

272
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,060
you get them on the right cannabinoids

273
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,620
maybe CBD during the day you really

274
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,119
start fighting that inflammation they

275
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,519
start relieving their symptoms they're

276
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,500
in better mood and then lo and behold

277
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,820
they have more energy patients have come

278
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,259
back to and said to me well I didn't

279
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,420
think getting something from the pot

280
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:05,100
place would give me more energy but it

281
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:07,439
has and that's really fighting that

282
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,759
stereotype that people who use marijuana

283
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,800
are going to be sitting on the couch

284
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,939
ordering pizza I mean our patients are

285
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,620
getting back into the gym they're

286
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,019
getting back to work they're walking

287
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,519
their dogs again and they're they're

288
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,019
loving more parts of their life or more

289
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,600
parts of their day

290
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,459
okay so I do believe that all illness

291
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,899
right you have to include the Mind Body

292
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,299
and the spirit and I feel that that's

293
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,519
why cannabis has helped so many people

294
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,740
is that not only does it relieve your

295
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,860
pain it also puts you in a better mood

296
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,259
and that is one of the reasons why in a

297
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,000
lot of studies cannabis is a more

298
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:40,759
successful pain reliever than opioids

299
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,679
it's because of that mood component

300
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,659
understanding that patients have gone

301
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,699
through a lot in their health Journey

302
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:50,039
before they have even come through our

303
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,140
door and we really like to focus on

304
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,179
being sympathetic and compassionate and

305
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:56,100
completely non-judgmental we have

306
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,379
patients that have been using cannabis

307
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,019
for years or decades we have many

308
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,759
patients who've never used it before we

309
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,740
welcome everyone the same way we have

310
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,078
something for everybody and we really

311
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,940
like to tailor our services to to

312
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:09,979
everyone for their uniqueness as an

313
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,480
individual

314
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,278
so when we look at our products and one

315
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,320
thing that's great about Connecticut is

316
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,360
that we do have a lot of information on

317
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,120
the label so we have the cannabinoid

318
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,519
potency so how how much THC or CBD and

319
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,500
as well as the terpenes now terpenes are

320
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,480
really important because we like to put

321
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,519
together the strain the cannabinoid

322
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,399
potency as well as the terpene profile

323
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,379
to really give a good kind of estimate

324
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,820
on how that particular Harvest is going

325
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:39,200
to make a patient feel

326
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:42,959
so you may have a classic Indica strain

327
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,360
that's maybe very high in THC and then

328
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:48,000
we look at the terpene profile and it

329
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,379
has maybe it's very high in pinine and

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,059
limonene will patients have come back

331
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,759
and told us well that's really good for

332
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,319
focus and energy and so we'll say okay

333
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:56,578
well you know perhaps that particular

334
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,980
Harvest is going to hit more like a

335
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:00,838
hybrid and not just be an Indica that's

336
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,240
going to put you to sleep so when

337
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,240
patients call or come in and they're

338
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,980
looking for a recommendation my advice

339
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,539
is tell me what delivery system you want

340
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,879
to use and how you want to feel and let

341
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,919
us do the rest

342
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,659
so there's some common misconceptions

343
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,860
that I'd like to clear up because I

344
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:18,659
think it's intimidating right and

345
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,399
patients might not want to get their car

346
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:22,078
to come to the dispensary they're

347
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,839
missing out on on so much potential

348
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,519
benefit a really common thing that I

349
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,019
hear is I don't want to get high I don't

350
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,899
want to get high and I say you know what

351
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,419
that is no problem whatsoever we can

352
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,639
cover your symptoms from morning to

353
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,199
night with cannabinoids that are not

354
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,600
going to give you a psychoactive effect

355
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,100
and you never have to smoke or vape some

356
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,659
patients do not feel comfortable with

357
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,740
that and that's completely okay because

358
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,379
we have so many different types of

359
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,820
Delivery Systems so you never have to

360
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,039
smoke or vape and you can still get that

361
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,379
full benefit from the program one of the

362
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,719
favorite things about my job is hosting

363
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:58,200
the monthly can of convos so we have

364
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,240
monthly virtual sessions where patients

365
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,339
can join general population and even

366
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,220
providers from other states have joined

367
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:08,220
and we talk about insomnia and terpenes

368
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,680
we talk about chronic illness and PTSD

369
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,778
and I like to share the current

370
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,059
cannabinoid research that is going on

371
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:16,559
how I implement it and how our

372
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:19,018
pharmacists because we also do staff

373
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,539
education as well so we share our

374
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:23,399
knowledge and how we can really use the

375
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,199
current research in treating our

376
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,179
patients every single day with the

377
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,160
products in Connecticut so that can look

378
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,799
like targeted cannabinoid therapy that

379
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,719
can look like not using THC all the time

380
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,578
or not using just CBD all the time

381
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,980
there's other minor cannabinoids right

382
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:40,679
there's thca there's CBN that we have in

383
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,019
the program and really understanding how

384
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,458
you can use different Delivery Systems

385
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:47,700
different cannabinoids at different

386
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:49,199
times of day to get 24-hour relief of

387
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,379
your symptoms it's really just having

388
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,560
those right Tools in your toolbox to

389
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:57,059
really get back control of your life and

390
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,559
it becomes a beautiful cannabis

391
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,018
community and our patients have even

392
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,338
given us feedback saying my favorite

393
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,139
part about these events is that I feel

394
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,079
like I belong to a community because

395
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,639
really it's also about

396
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,219
removing the stigma from using marijuana

397
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,720
as medicine we have patients that are

398
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,940
even judged by their our own family

399
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,500
members for how they choose to medicate

400
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,180
and treat their symptoms and we wanted

401
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,179
them to know that we're here for them we

402
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:23,578
understand we're all in on this together

403
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:26,338
and really getting sharing the knowledge

404
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:29,219
of why cannabis medicine using

405
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:32,519
scientific evidence is so empowering for

406
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,259
us and it really helps patients feel

407
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,820
more comfortable and strong in their

408
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:37,919
decision to use cannabis as their

409
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,139
medicine so the monthly events are

410
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,439
definitely one of my favorite parts of

411
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:45,539
the job and so coming up I'm going to be

412
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,360
doing cannabis and Pain Management which

413
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:50,099
is a huge topic and then for Valentine's

414
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,839
Day in February we're going to do PTSD

415
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,000
and relationships I'm looking forward to

416
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,160
that as well what we also do for our

417
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,679
education department is spend time with

418
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,600
certifiers providers and doctors so

419
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,479
really getting them to understand what

420
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,860
we're doing here at the dispensary again

421
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,720
talking about how we do the

422
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,419
consultations how we review patients

423
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,220
medication lists all other diagnoses

424
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,620
that they may have because the body is

425
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,459
just one body it's all connected and

426
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,740
that's what's amazing about the

427
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,899
endocannabinoid system it helps regulate

428
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,698
all of the physiological functions in

429
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,958
the body so you really have to

430
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:25,019
understand what's going on everywhere

431
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,759
and I like to really push for the

432
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:30,060
potential of the plant to see what this

433
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,220
plant can do and that is that really

434
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,539
kind of keeps me going all right so my

435
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,579
