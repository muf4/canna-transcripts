1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,760
here on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,929
going to be going over

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:10,618
radish use in organic farming systems

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:10,618
[Music]

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,160
okay if you're wondering how you might

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,199
want to incorporate radish in organic

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,960
farming systems

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,600
this is a little research article that

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,080
i'm going to provide a great summary of

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,599
so first off that article this is that

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,598
if you want to look at it in more detail

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,518
but for the citation right here

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,799
so if you want to look at some more of

14
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,119
the specifics

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,119
here is your resource to look at too i'm

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,000
going to provide a summary here

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,799
so first off the radish seed stock well

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,238
when we're looking

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,479
at our radishes there are currently

20
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,679
two radish varieties that are marketed

21
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,119
for cover cropping

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:54,159
with certified genetics graza raza

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,679
and tillage radish all radishes

24
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,759
are insect pollinated and

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,159
cross-pollinate easily increasing the

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,799
likelihood of genetic variability

27
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,919
if not grown in strict isolation of one

28
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,158
another

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,760
so the effects on soil structure well

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,760
when we're looking at under favorable

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,359
conditions

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
roots can actually extend three feet

33
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,920
deep in only 60 days

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,759
the root commonly referred to as a tuber

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,320
even though it's not botanically correct

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,319
can extend more than 12 inches after

37
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,798
radishes winter kill their large fleshy

38
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,879
roots

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,560
desiccate and the channels created by

40
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,039
those roots tend to remain

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,079
open at the soil surface this opening

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,479
that we can see

43
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,359
located right over here created by those

44
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,118
roots

45
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,519
tend to allow for improving of

46
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:40,319
infiltration surface drainage

47
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,640
and also aid in soil warming all great

48
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,559
benefits

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
however radishes can also have effect on

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,719
weeds a good stand of radishes can

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,600
eliminate nearly all weed growth both

52
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,118
during and for some time after active

53
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,359
radish growth

54
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,200
the to obtain near complete weed

55
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,920
suppression radishes should be planted

56
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
early

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,159
basically six or more weeks before frost

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,840
at relatively high population densities

59
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,640
which is considered to be more than five

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,080
plants

61
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,199
per square foot into a clean seed bed

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,719
so they don't really compete well

63
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,159
initially depending on that clean seed

64
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,000
bed you can have kind of those kind of

65
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,799
suppression weed suppression allopathic

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,800
effects

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,480
even post radish removal or death

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,840
now the effects on seed bed preparation

69
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,079
well after winter kill

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,159
or other causes of mortality radish

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,480
residues deteriorate rapidly

72
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,560
as a result fall biomass production is

73
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,639
unlikely to interfere with spring

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
field work which is a great thing unlike

75
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,679
some other cover crops

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,519
so when we're looking here at the dates

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,920
this is basically the month of

78
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,719
april and we're looking at volumetric

79
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,318
soil

80
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,479
concentration and then we're looking at

81
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,799
daily range of soil temperature

82
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,518
we're seeing rye compared to a radish

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,519
here

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,840
now the rye tends to have colder soil

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,280
temps than the radish overall

86
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,959
so that can be important for spring

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,598
planting we're trying to get that soil

88
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,519
warmed up

89
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,199
quicker to get germination here we're

90
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,080
looking at no cover crop forage radish

91
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,000
and rye

92
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,760
rye being up here and then down here

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
being the forage rash that volumetric

94
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,120
soil water concentration so we're

95
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
reducing the amount of water in that

96
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,959
soil learning to infiltrate more

97
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,120
in the early spring that is what can

98
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,959
help allow our soils to warm

99
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,158
up we're removing some of that water now

100
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
we see here at the end must have been

101
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,959
some rain events that occurred

102
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,280
but for the most part reducing that

103
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,280
moisture can allow that

104
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,560
ability for growers to go into a field

105
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,039
earlier

106
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,199
that effects on soil erosion and runoff

107
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,878
so radishes grow rapidly when planted in

108
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,839
late summer or early fall

109
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,798
and 10 pounds acre drilled on a 7.5 inch

110
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,560
rose can provide

111
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,400
full canopy enclosure in about 3 weeks

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,479
this canopy interrupts raindrops

113
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,200
minimizing surface impaction

114
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,719
and detachment of soil particles

115
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,639
decomposing residue

116
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,080
due to winter kill can still provide

117
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,878
early spring

118
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,560
erosion control all great things we look

119
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,798
at it kind of here in soil loss in

120
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,878
pounds per acre at farm a and farm b

121
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,480
we can see no cover crop versus cover

122
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,560
crop being a radish

123
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,399
the erosion from the three february to

124
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
march storms was negligible

125
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,039
for forage rash despite rapidly

126
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,719
decomposition soil surface residues here

127
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,120
so we can see just clearly here two

128
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,279
different farms the massive difference

129
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
that the incorporation of radish as a

130
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,279
cover crop

131
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,320
can impact on the reduction in soil loss

132
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,319
and as we all know

133
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,759
soil is very important so anyways we can

134
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,478
reduce erosion and runoff

135
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
are good things lastly there are some

136
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:30,560
potential problems so not everything is

137
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,399
100

138
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,399
perfect because radishes have little

139
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,079
tons for wet soils

140
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,319
so radishes are very responsive to

141
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,319
nitrogen and nitrogen deficiency limits

142
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,879
their ability to compete with weeds

143
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,560
and grow through compacted soil so not

144
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,918
great to put into a really severely

145
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,560
nitrogen deficient

146
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,319
field rashes are only moderately cold

147
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,079
hearty and need about six weeks of

148
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,519
favorable growing conditions to produce

149
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,359
sufficient biomass

150
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,359
to achieve most of the potential

151
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,240
benefits so again keep that in mind as

152
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
well

153
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,478
as a warning rotting radishes residues

154
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,960
can produce a powerful

155
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,959
rotten egg-like kind of sulfur-like odor

156
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,560
particularly during winter thaws

157
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,638
if you have neighbors close by and are

158
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,240
planting in high densities

159
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,800
that could potentially cause you some

160
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,840
problems so just be aware of that with

161
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,840
everything there is a

162
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,918
benefit and there can also be some

163
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,079
drawbacks so just want you to be fully

164
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,159
aware before you commit to this entirely

165
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,159
but definitely worth some consideration

166
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,840
for some of the benefits but also keep

167
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,840
in mind some of those drawbacks
