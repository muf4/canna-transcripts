1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
okay here I want to talk about high

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:06,298
intensity discharge grow light bulbs and

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,219
here's an example of one right here I

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,609
hopefully understand that was a little

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,888
bit more after this lecture so HID bulbs

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:16,259
installation and removal well never

7
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,969
directly touch the bulb as the oils of

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,730
your hands can weaken the glass and

9
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:23,910
increase the odds of breaking here using

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,310
our plastic gloves in addition to paper

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,469
towel also here putting them on paper

12
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,118
towel right from the start to ensure

13
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,399
you're not going to go and touch them

14
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,619
also on the not if you're gonna be

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,689
removing the bulb make sure that it is

16
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,429
not warm why make sure it's fully cooled

17
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,128
before you're even going through and

18
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:43,229
touching it with anything before you're

19
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:44,669
removing it from the fixture so bulb

20
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:46,259
breaks hopefully you're not in the area

21
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,520
when it does you want to make sure you

22
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,530
turn off electricity as soon as you

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,809
realize it and give it sufficient time

24
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,280
to cool off then to remove it because

25
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,698
it'll be shards of glass when I take a

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,649
potato cut it in half take the flat side

27
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,899
and jam it against the broken shards of

28
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,509
glass and then we're also holding onto

29
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,460
the potato you want to then turn to

30
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,769
loosen the bulb without way it's a very

31
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,709
safe way to remove a bulb that has

32
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,750
broken which is not a good condition to

33
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,000
be in but it is a safe way to help

34
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,670
remove that bulb with minimal chance of

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,200
damage to yourself

36
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,579
want to replace the bulbs well lumen

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,700
output will degrade over time resulting

38
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,188
in less heat and poor growing spectrum

39
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,978
when a document the day the month in the

40
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:30,959
year of purchase if your grow shop does

41
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,209
not do this when you purchase it bulb

42
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,649
replacement is often debated but chip if

43
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,658
the stated life of the bulb you are

44
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,700
using and then by having that

45
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,950
documentation of that day that month in

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,450
the year allows you to make a judgment

47
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,859
of how long when the hours to be running

48
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,859
in today and what the expected life

49
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,868
would be of that bulb make sure you have

50
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:52,319
some bulbs on hand and that can means

51
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:54,599
you need to match up with whatever type

52
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,368
of fixture you're using keeps in spirits

53
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,109
on hand replacing bulbs after six to

54
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:59,280
eight months is not unheard of in

55
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,560
depending what type of light you're

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,718
running do not look at the bulb all it's

57
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,579
on turn it off a lot to cool and then

58
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,349
inspect the arc tube for a cloudy or

59
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,359
dark discoloration if you're not sure

60
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:10,859
how old the bulb is this will indicate

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
it you need to change the bulb when they

62
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,950
get that kind of arcing a net blackness

63
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,259
there some grow

64
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,359
so even keep extra fixtures on hand in

65
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,219
case of Alice goes out but make sure

66
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,110
you're having definitely plenty of extra

67
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:26,370
bulbs especially for running many of the

68
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:28,050
same light structure there's a debate

69
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,878
between single and double ended bulbs

70
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,790
it's a single ina this is a double ended

71
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:34,620
see lemons produce less heat they're

72
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,120
better fit for smaller areas with low

73
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,480
ceiling height and they're typically

74
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,909
used in growing operations double ended

75
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,798
as this as we see the de this is single

76
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,419
ended in double and these are typically

77
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:47,010
used for a large-scale production as

78
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,298
they produce more heat but you're

79
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:50,729
getting more light for the same energy

80
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:53,640
and as a result these are typically used

81
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:56,189
in larger areas or grow rooms than the

82
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,529
single ended ones are and both very

83
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,120
effective but looking at just maximizing

84
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,280
the efficiency that much more in a large

85
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,299
area that you can cool the double-ended

86
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,299
is the way to go
