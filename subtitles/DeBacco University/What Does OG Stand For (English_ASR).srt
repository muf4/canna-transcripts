1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
okay see I'm gonna go over what does og

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:07,169
stand for and particularly what is o

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,388
dstean for in relation to cannabis now a

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:10,980
picture of Stonehenge here simply

5
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,199
because it's kind of one of those things

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,320
that for OG in the cannabis world

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:19,739
everyone recognizes that's there but may

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,980
argue or debate the actual original or

9
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:25,559
the reason why it's simply put there and

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,018
also there's some varying opinions on

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,278
what it actually does stand for so I

12
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,219
tried to provide some information on

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,659
that so first off Oh G usually stands

14
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,450
for some people think it's ocean grown

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,759
other people original gangster this is a

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,410
highly debated topic however most

17
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,000
indications refer to the fact that the

18
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:45,179
og name started in Southern California

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,519
and close proximity to the ocean but is

20
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,920
also where the Crips Street gang started

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,379
the cush is the main cultivar to focus

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,809
on because it's often said he who has

23
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,089
the cush wins so the og cush did find

24
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,459
one of more familiar Oh G names out

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,780
there their supporting arguments for

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,129
both ocean grown and original gangster

27
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,689
so OD for ocean grown what was

28
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,219
supporting arguments for that well the

29
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,228
coast range came from the Hindu Kush

30
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,060
mountains that's where it got its throw

31
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:14,280
the cush name came from it was brought

32
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,960
to the west coast on the ocean climate

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,950
particularly California Southern

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,438
California also and this is a very

35
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,359
different climate than the Hindu Kush

36
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,179
mountains so it's resulted the change in

37
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,828
terpenes this leads to the term OG Kush

38
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,750
to indicate where it was grown since

39
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,219
cush grown near the ocean would have

40
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,379
different effects and curse ground in

41
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,989
the mountains so the presence of the

42
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,179
name o G the absence would be identifier

43
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:42,298
letting people know what effects stick

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,700
expect and it would indicate also where

45
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,770
it was grown

46
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,079
now the og for original gangster support

47
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,719
hovers also in this area in Los Angeles

48
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,219
Southern California the term original

49
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,429
gangster is quite popular due to the

50
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,618
Crips Street gang that started around in

51
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,740
1969 the first became popular or

52
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,000
originated in the Los Angeles area where

53
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,280
oh gee has strong ties with the

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,379
established street gang which means

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,878
original gangster since growing the

56
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,709
coach started in Southern California

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,739
it's natural that should be called the

58
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,640
original due to the coaches potency

59
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,810
more than qualifies it and a gangster so

60
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,849
let's try to get this to be a kind of

61
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,319
answer to the ocean grounders Original

62
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,729
Gangster so it's likely when the

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,650
cannabis cultivar cush was grown in

64
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,079
Southern California the flavor profile

65
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,450
was changed from the native mountain

66
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,860
regions the same can be applied to

67
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:33,449
growing the cush cultivar in other

68
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,460
places of the United States so it was

69
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:37,979
kind of like the new cush we could think

70
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,540
about it as like these hard candies here

71
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:41,219
is Jolly Ranchers there are different

72
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,590
flavors there are also gelling ranchers

73
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,419
but they have different effects or

74
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,800
different those flavors and this is

75
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:49,349
relating to different maybe terpene

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,530
profiles despite being that same broad

77
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:54,210
category so it's most likely resulted in

78
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,650
other growers relating something special

79
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,659
about being grown near the ocean

80
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,670
meanwhile in Southern California growers

81
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:02,520
were referring to their homegrown

82
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:04,859
cultivar as the original due to the

83
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,700
history of the area in title Rijal

84
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,760
gangster is very logical

85
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:13,649
so where's OG stand for so oh gee is

86
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,439
most likely referred to which is ocean

87
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,150
grown as a way to distinguish the flavor

88
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,639
change but those in Southern California

89
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,590
know that this potent cultivar started

90
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,649
in their backyard so they're more up to

91
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,689
call original gangster so was this kind

92
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,730
of meanwhile OG to the masses I think is

93
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,680
where the confusion comes in however

94
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:34,679
since OD has been transferred to many

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,840
other facets of life in these situations

96
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,430
it's there's no connection to a plant so

97
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,530
it's only thought of to connect with

98
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,629
Original Gangster this is probably the

99
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,789
most accepted kind of term there that

100
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,930
refers to that original gangster simply

101
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:49,229
because it's being applied to other

102
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,120
situations but there is some clear

103
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,340
evidence that og may stand for at least

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,890
the cannabis originally as getting into

105
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,659
that ocean grown standpoint even though

106
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:01,619
now with its popularity OG to the masses

107
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,960
most people have a connection to

108
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,770
original gangster being the definition

109
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,770
of og
