1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
this is a term that gets tossed down a

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:06,089
lot that's pH you know live check your

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,580
pH what's the pH speech went up went

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,250
down where I look here exactly what is

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,019
pH well the definition is it's the

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,388
measure of molar concentrations of

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,278
hydrogen ions in a solution it can

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,230
towards whether it's an acid or a base

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,820
what is this measure kind of mean while

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,859
we're measuring hydrogen ions

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,170
what's a hydrogen ion well it's a

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,970
hydrogen atom that has a charge in this

13
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,720
case a hydrogen ion has a positive

14
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,118
charge here

15
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,460
a cation typically hydrogen contains a

16
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,920
proton and electron when it loses that

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,500
electron becomes just a proton and here

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,439
we have our hydrogen ion and that

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,509
hydrogen ion h+ cations also usually

20
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,899
just refer to or sometimes as just a

21
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:49,738
proton now the scale of pH it's measured

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,649
from 0 to 14 if you're us under 7 that

23
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:55,500
range of pH is is considered acidic 7 is

24
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:59,399
considered neutral and above 7 is the

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,460
basic range or alkaline now pH directly

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,049
means potential of hydrogen the scale is

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,879
a logarithmic we'll talk about that a

28
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,270
little bit do you determine the city a

29
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,158
basis of a water based aqueous which is

30
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,170
increasing from water based solution

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,479
there's also something called Poh and

32
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,759
that's potential of hydroxide and while

33
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,750
we typically focus on pH hydroxides kind

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,819
of like the opposite so we take P h2 and

35
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,859
the Poh of that would be 12 if we add

36
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,258
them together we get 14 which is our

37
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:31,650
scale here so again we're focusing on

38
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,659
the hydrogen ions here are the 0 14

39
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,549
scale there's also a Poh it works on the

40
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,109
same 0 to 14 CL it's kind of just the

41
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,890
opposite you can kind of see related

42
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:42,840
here but again our focus here is pH now

43
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,368
acids and bases so an acid is a

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,850
substance that increases the hydrogen

45
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:50,009
ion concentration of a solution so this

46
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:53,250
kind of lever shows here as the hydrogen

47
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,688
ions increase the pH will decrease so

48
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,530
examples of tomato juice grapefruit

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,449
juice and lemon juice

50
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,439
they have investing amounts of hydrogen

51
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,820
ions therefore the pH becomes lower

52
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:04,709
bases are any substance that reduces the

53
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,589
hydrogen ion concentration in a solution

54
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:09,750
that's defined as a base simply those

55
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,810
bases reduced hydrogen ions directly by

56
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,889
accepting them again examples of

57
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,680
solutions that are bases

58
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,329
be like baking soda ammonia and bleaches

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,890
and drain cleaners those are much more

60
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,260
in the base side or that pH below 7 pH

61
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:27,049
neutral is set is 7 so this is a

62
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:30,509
solution that's not acidic or alkaline

63
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,400
such as pure water pure h2o there's a pH

64
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,959
of 7 you can see these universal

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,060
indicators you know colors that they may

66
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,070
turn typically around that green range

67
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,459
would be representative of a solution

68
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:43,530
within neutral pH the pH scale of the

69
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,689
aqueous solution it's the measure of the

70
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,150
hydrogen and hydroxide ions measure of

71
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:50,370
the zero to 14 degree in most biological

72
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,330
fluids are in the page range of 6 to 8

73
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,400
each pH unit represents a tenfold a

74
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,830
difference that scales logarithm we see

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,840
it here this means a small change in pH

76
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,120
actually indicates a substantial change

77
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,129
in hydrogen and hydroxide ion

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,439
concentrations as you can kind of see an

79
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:10,439
example here 2 tenfold increase we're

80
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,449
moving that decimal place every pH so

81
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,039
you can see a large difference and we

82
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:15,659
may hear terms something called like

83
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,759
strong acids or bases so what does this

84
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,379
mean well strong acids and bases are

85
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,899
ones that completely disassociate in

86
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,060
water so here we see hydrochloric acid

87
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,340
HCL that breaks apart into a hydrogen

88
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,709
ion and chloride ion completely the

89
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,390
strong base here sodium hydroxide sodium

90
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,209
and hydroxide completely breaking apart

91
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:35,099
in water weak acids and bases they only

92
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,330
partially break apart either they only

93
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,530
partially break apart they can kind of

94
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,049
flip back and forth that's what these

95
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,140
arrows refer to so sometimes we see

96
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,549
strong acids strong bases weak acids

97
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,529
weak bases and this is just kind of

98
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,319
giving you the background of the kind of

99
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,360
a chemistry that's going on behind these

100
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,489
now we had a acid and a base for example

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,500
a strong acid and the strong base mix

102
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,750
them together in equal proportions we

103
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,069
should get pure water and salt what does

104
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,719
that look like here well if you have

105
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,969
hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide

106
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,919
which I mentioned are both strong acids

107
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:07,799
and strong bases they'll break apart

108
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,389
into h2o and sodium chloride that's

109
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,730
basically water flipping back and forth

110
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:14,189
so where does the h2o come from we have

111
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:16,829
the H here in H here that's the two H's

112
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,988
in the oxygen form in water and in the

113
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,608
sodium and the chloride forming here so

114
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,978
you kind of get salt water in an ideal

115
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:27,060
situation mixing a strong acid in base

116
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,599
here the pH scale is a concentration of

117
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,819
hydrogen

118
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,920
and given substance in the equation

119
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,439
behind that speech equals minus the log

120
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,449
and these brackets mean concentration of

121
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,949
hydrogen ions what does this kind of

122
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,909
look like kind of in a graphical

123
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,699
representation here

124
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,880
well pH neutral seven has equal amounts

125
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,729
of hydrogen ions in equal amounts of

126
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,069
hydroxide ions as we become increasing

127
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,140
acidity we are working our way this way

128
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:54,990
we can see the percentage of our hydrant

129
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,389
ions increases as we become more basic

130
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,920
the hydrogen ions decrease remember as I

131
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,839
mentioned the pH we're talking about it

132
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,460
from the standpoint Poh would look at

133
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,289
the opposite and that's the hydroxide

134
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,829
ion so you can see how that changes as

135
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,830
we shift our pH from 7 now here's just

136
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:12,779
an example why being precise with pH is

137
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:14,669
important how much greater is the

138
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,489
hydrogen ion concentration in the

139
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:20,670
solution with pH 2 than a pH with

140
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,069
solutions 6 so we're looking at this is

141
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,620
only a difference of 4 but we apply this

142
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,689
to this equation here pH minus the log

143
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,949
of the hydrogen ion concentration

144
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,290
comparing these two pH is that only

145
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:33,569
differ by 4 well it's not just off

146
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,860
difference of 4 points it's actually a

147
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:40,469
difference of 10,000 times greater our

148
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,150
four decimal places greater that's

149
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,490
because again this is a logarithmic

150
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:46,289
scale so that's why it's very important

151
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,600
to maintain pH in a very tight range

152
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:52,310
because if you don't really bad things

153
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:55,740
can happen in biological systems so so

154
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,839
allow these organisms to buffer

155
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,930
themselves on these PHS what is a buffer

156
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,329
mean well it resists a change in pH may

157
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,150
help order in particular the body and

158
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:08,129
also in plants with peaches within a

159
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:09,839
narrow range there are combinations of

160
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:12,240
hydrogen ion acceptors and donors to

161
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,189
help kind of reduce the change that

162
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,699
occurs so let's take distilled water for

163
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:19,230
an extreme example here is our volume of

164
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,199
sodium hydroxide this is a strong base

165
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:24,270
added so we started at neutral pH and we

166
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,099
add the ever slightest drop of sodium

167
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:28,229
hydroxide and we see the peach spiked up

168
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,790
immediately then we have different

169
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,590
levels of buffer or different

170
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,150
concentrations above her you can see

171
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:36,569
even adding a very small amount of

172
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:38,879
buffer will reduce that the quickly

173
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,949
changing pH the higher amount of buffer

174
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,319
here we can see we maintain

175
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,599
this ph prayed well consistent

176
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,480
throughout all the different volume of

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,879
sodium hydroxide found added here so

178
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,590
again this helps organisms maintain life

179
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:57,899
or homeostasis you're maintaining a very

180
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:59,219
tight buffer system for your blood so

181
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,649
this is very important that your blood

182
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,000
stays in a very tight range of 7.34 to

183
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:07,919
7.38 that's normal pH of 7 to 7 point

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,959
it's gonna cause some issues and if you

185
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,300
reach as low as a pH of 6 or as high pH

186
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,009
of 9 it's gonna result in death luckily

187
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,470
your body has ways of maintaining this

188
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:18,240
through buffers and other means and we

189
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,120
can see just the importance of

190
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,189
maintaining pH knowing what it is and

191
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,600
keeping it within a tight range to allow

192
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:26,600
organs to grow and develop
