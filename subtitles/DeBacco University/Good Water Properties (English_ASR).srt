1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
so here we're going to go over what

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,730
properties define good water so for

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,169
plants are typically wanting to irrigate

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,059
with good water well what does that look

5
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:11,580
like what does that contain and I go

6
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:13,048
over some of those properties here so

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,150
starting with potable or drinking water

8
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:17,100
this is water that has a high

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,769
cleanliness rating this is the symbol

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,449
for it and what potable means now that

11
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,550
can be used for drinking but it can also

12
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,070
be used for cooking or food preparation

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,599
tap water meets the drinking water

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,820
standards but this does not mean all

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,349
water is the same this means is that

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,329
just because it's drinking a potable

17
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,039
that means you can drink it but it

18
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,558
doesn't mean that there's any set

19
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,109
standards for exactly what it contains

20
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,359
there's certain levels that needs to

21
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,039
meet to be defined as this drinking

22
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,769
water but there could be different

23
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,628
levels of chlorine or cured imide or

24
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,920
other kind of properties in it that

25
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:52,339
would still classify it as drinking

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,620
water but can have other adverse effects

27
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,440
if you're looking at adding microbes for

28
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,820
example so good water is critical so

29
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,500
again what defines that good water

30
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,719
well potable drinking water as I say is

31
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,519
a good start but you're also looking for

32
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,640
properties such as as a neutral pH

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,618
around seven low easy or electrical

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,359
connectivity and minimal additives such

35
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,670
as chlorine because chlorine is gonna

36
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,430
kill some microbes and could cause some

37
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,079
other issues with growing plants that

38
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,850
would be perfectly fine and safe for

39
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,649
drinking so again the drinking water

40
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:23,669
potable waters good place to start but

41
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,130
there are some other properties you

42
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,259
should be checking there's something

43
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,000
called grey water and this is second

44
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,700
grade water it's not like perfectly

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,259
clean it's kind of at this grayish look

46
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,630
to it this is typically used for

47
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,728
flushing toilets but it can also be used

48
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:40,349
for irrigation so I think you have to

49
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:42,478
use potable or drinking water for

50
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:45,179
irrigation grey water is often used for

51
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,578
irrigation however if it is used there

52
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,159
can be risks associated with it so it

53
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,688
needs to be used with caution and in

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,020
different situations it may be more

55
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:56,908
advantageous than others so it's good

56
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,468
whether it's drinking water grey water

57
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,570
or whatever irrigation water you're

58
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:02,339
using is to get it tested good for

59
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,929
multiple tests in multiple samples I'm

60
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,450
just taking one test at one time and

61
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,640
consider that good for the entire year

62
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,709
for example if using city water you can

63
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,439
get a report from the place where you

64
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,360
get it from the municipality and

65
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,210
see the metropolitan district Commission

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,570
of Connecticut is one in the local area

67
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,490
here that's great at providing testing

68
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:25,379
so the MDC and they prepare water

69
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,200
quality reports annually provide

70
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,699
summaries of past years water quality

71
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,709
the test one hundred and thirty

72
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,179
potential water contaminants reservoirs

73
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,950
treatment plants forty seven state

74
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,379
approved sampling sites throughout

75
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:38,849
twelve towns service areas they

76
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,859
distribute an average of fifty million

77
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:42,870
gallons of water per day to a population

78
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,670
about four hundred thousand located in

79
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,349
the state of Connecticut they've been

80
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,349
great I've personally just called them

81
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:51,539
up and I was able to get a water sample

82
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:54,090
report for water samples that they had

83
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,709
pulled the previous day in my local area

84
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,879
so again reach out to where you're

85
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,390
getting your water from if you are

86
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,579
getting it from a from the tap water

87
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,109
source they can provide you with reports

88
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,990
not only annual that sometimes very

89
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,390
current you can also test it yourself to

90
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,710
ensure that you have properties that

91
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,709
constitute good water
