1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,240
okay so here I'm gonna go over the

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:09,330
basics of a Gram stain and this is used

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,230
for identifying certain bacteria based

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:16,710
on the type of exterior structure that

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,289
these prokaryotes have so starting with

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,199
the basics Gram stain as it says in the

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,580
name it's a staining technique for

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,800
primarily identification of bacteria

9
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,348
there's something called a gram positive

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,160
my gram negative so what's this

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,899
referring to as gram positive bacteria

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,340
located up here they have a very thick

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,719
outer cell wall here I'll peptidoglycan

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,870
gram negative had this kind of

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,450
protective outer layer here this doesn't

16
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,729
allow the stain really penetrate so I

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,829
think about gram positive you've

18
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,679
positively accepting the dye

19
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,899
I'm gram negative not kind of accepting

20
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:58,469
the main die there in the outer outer

21
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,439
walls so for example here we have a

22
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,329
plasma membrane and this outer area here

23
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,359
is our pepto glycan this is our gram

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,728
positive you see how it's very thick

25
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,909
here we there's a peptidoglycan layer in

26
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:14,938
it gram negative but this exterior here

27
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,430
is kind of a polysaccharide in the

28
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,679
protein the peptidoglycan here is really

29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,780
good absorbing some of this purple dye

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,210
but because it's embedded below another

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,340
membrane that's that stain really

32
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:29,429
doesn't work all that well or if it's a

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,930
gram positive bacteria because of that

34
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,360
thick peptidoglycan while being on the

35
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,790
outside it is able to accept some of

36
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,379
that dye so difference in diabete engine

37
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,780
is depend on the physical and chemical

38
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,399
properties of the bacterial cell wall in

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,200
this case the exterior portion is cell

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,240
wall this gram stain was developed in

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,290
the 1800's by someone by the last name

42
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,769
gram and that's where it gets its name

43
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,229
from so here's the basic procedure

44
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:54,679
so just remember grandpa's bacteria

45
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:57,899
thick dense relatively non-porous walls

46
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,700
long comparison gram-negative bacteria

47
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,478
have thin walls surrounded by a lipid

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,399
rich membranes

49
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,030
think of lipids as kind of repelling

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,799
things this is a detailed procedure here

51
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,580
I'm gonna go through it kind of step by

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,349
step for you another example of the gram

53
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,160
staining procedure what things are going

54
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:16,139
to look like

55
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,319
we're looking at basically making our

56
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,189
bacterial cells either purple or red

57
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,009
let's go through this kind of this

58
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:25,139
procedure again I got this off online

59
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,609
here I made some modifications myself

60
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,059
but you always want to be careful to set

61
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,200
your sources so I'm including that here

62
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,140
step one of a gram same procedure

63
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,379
prepare the smear so you're taking your

64
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,849
bacteria you're smearing them on a slide

65
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,979
suspend some material stained in the

66
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:42,900
drop stand in a drop of water and a

67
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,060
microscope slide spread the drop about

68
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,219
the size of a nickel allow to air dry

69
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,990
initially then heat fix by gently

70
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,449
warming above the flame or other heat

71
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,360
source what this is doing this is fixing

72
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:56,459
the bacteria so we're basically sticking

73
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,520
them to the slide here we just let the

74
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,490
drop of water dry I think when we re wet

75
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,740
that I'm just going to slide around this

76
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,600
fixing procedure not only denatures that

77
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,939
in basel but it allows them to also the

78
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,379
stick to the slide wouldn't be careful

79
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,449
make them as thin as possible if it's

80
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,969
too thick it won't work really great so

81
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:17,639
thin is very important here okay

82
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:19,680
procedure to apply the primary stain

83
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,869
flood stands in this case crystal

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,430
eyelets a very purple color will last

85
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,020
and for thirty Seconds to a minute and

86
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,599
rinsed water to remove excessive stain

87
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,760
so here just a little circles and boxes

88
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,159
or different bacteria we flood the whole

89
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,669
areas crystal violet then we let it sit

90
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,310
for a period of time then here's our

91
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:41,458
same bacteria we flood the smear with

92
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,530
iodine solution will allow that stand

93
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,539
for 30 seconds to a minute you'll notice

94
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,459
technically at this point of the Gram

95
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,069
stain procedure all of our bacteria are

96
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,479
purple a couple other important areas

97
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:54,209
will go through a little change those

98
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,789
colors we want to rinse off to remove

99
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,009
excessive iodine so now they're all the

100
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:00,840
item that was here we've rinsed all that

101
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,370
off and now it is ten they have all

102
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,500
ourselves being purple but we're not

103
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,819
done yet

104
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,400
Step five is to decolorize this is

105
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,439
important step when I dip it in 95%

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,140
alcohol or drip ninety-five percent

107
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,949
alcohol across the entire slide for only

108
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:19,620
about five seconds this will basically

109
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:21,599
decolorize those cells that aren't

110
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,280
holding on to that stain very strongly

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,110
you can notice here there are a lighter

112
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,029
purple color well these are still a

113
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,990
strong part more if you let it sit for

114
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:30,269
too long

115
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,430
all the cells so not only is the

116
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:35,279
procedure and steps important but also

117
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,740
timing they'll enter rinsed remove all

118
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,568
excess alcohol what that's going to do

119
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,720
is kind of leave us with the purple

120
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:44,879
cells and now these are decolorized we

121
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,500
want to counter stain the Safran

122
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,629
solution is very kind of deep red

123
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,538
solution pour this on the side let the

124
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:53,430
stand for 30 seconds then we want to

125
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:55,649
rinse dry and observe with that staff is

126
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,019
saying does is it takes those that don't

127
00:04:55,649 --> 00:05:00,000
have any color and it just binds lightly

128
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:01,469
and those are a gram negatives we don't

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,038
want to sit too long or kind of mess up

130
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,590
the crystal violet of the gram positives

131
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,060
so this is why timing is important so

132
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:11,159
rinse with water move excesses stain

133
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,329
blot dry and observant of the oil

134
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,009
immersion of the microscope gives it

135
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:18,508
same basic procedure I walked you

136
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,460
through it and you're welcome to pause

137
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:22,800
the video and look this over you feel

138
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,239
this might be more helpful but this is

139
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,069
kind of the end result that you get and

140
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,379
as a result we can see if they're very

141
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:30,930
rod shaped a very circular shaped both

142
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,908
of these are gram positives indicating

143
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,300
these have that very thick peptidoglycan

144
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:38,219
wall example cream stands for the

145
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,800
negative here's to the rods and the

146
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,840
circles again King was a very thin of

147
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,389
neglecting and basically having a

148
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,418
thicker lipid on the lipid layer on the

149
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:50,728
outside here this slide contains both

150
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:53,639
this is from the previous image and this

151
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:56,089
contains both of the gram positives and

152
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,079
grand negatives on the same slide

153
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,329
looking again look a little closer look

154
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,250
at those gram negatives zooming in on

155
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:04,019
that you know that so cell layers here

156
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,939
there's cell walls we see there's an

157
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:07,649
inner and outer membrane the

158
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,348
peptidoglycan is located here kind of

159
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:12,750
sandwiched between the two as a result

160
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:14,788
that crystal violet can't really bind or

161
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,668
stick to this very well and this is why

162
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:19,468
we call them gram negatives lastly

163
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,448
there's a couple of video links if

164
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:23,639
you're interested in learning more if

165
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,468
you feel to just want to review you're

166
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,740
