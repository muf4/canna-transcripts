1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,919
okay here we're gonna take a brief

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,778
overview of the pilum eleska found kind

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:10,009
of a cool image here of a greater blue

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:13,939
ringed octopus and a snail both are

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:17,730
classified under this particular phylum

6
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:20,160
so start off with these mollusks are

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,289
sila mates they have a soft body and

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,570
it's comprised of three regions we have

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,609
a head foot region visceral mass

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,810
canoeing the body's organs and then a

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,399
mantle which envelops the visceral mass

12
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:34,949
and is associated with gills that

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,390
capture oxygen from water and release

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,700
carbon dioxide's it's kind of the way

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,558
that they breathe now looking at that

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,450
head foot region you know the foot

17
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,328
region of looking in this case of the

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,489
snail and the head region located here

19
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,250
visceral mass is that main area

20
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:52,709
containing all the organs and that

21
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,448
mantle hearing kid in blue here is that

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,679
area that's allowing that gas exchange

23
00:00:54,448 --> 00:01:00,689
between oxygen and carbon dioxide so

24
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,789
there's three main groups of mouths

25
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,349
there's a castro paws which are your

26
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,239
snails and slugs actually may be most

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,298
familiar with bivalves with clams

28
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,949
oysters and scallops and cephalopods are

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,350
your octopus and your squid

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,420
these are all classified under the same

31
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:20,489
phylum a little bit more of a detailed

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,070
look here as we can see over here all

33
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,079
the different types this snail the

34
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,779
gastropods we have a little bit of

35
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,728
description there are clams sea ice kind

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,829
of it's partially open here bivalve

37
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:34,069
contains two shells that's where we've

38
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:37,438
got two valves bivalve comes from

39
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:39,239
cephalopods such as the octopus they can

40
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,419
release ink when they're trying to

41
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:45,390
escape from predators and they have ways

42
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,118
to propel themselves also very smart

43
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,609
animals here a large brain of

44
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,709
considering their relative body size and

45
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,349
very soon videos on them they can figure

46
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,938
quite a bit of complex problems and

47
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:01,649
puzzles out which is quite interesting

48
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:05,069
now looking at addition here our snail

49
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,799
for example as is rad you lot this is a

50
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:08,579
feeding structure now this is a very

51
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,370
unique structure

52
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,710
it's a rasping tongue like organ that

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,840
has rows of pointed backward

54
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,040
teeth look at it here it's like there's

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
kind of a little bit of rough region

56
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,030
when we look at it very specifically and

57
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,849
close up in our microscope we see how

58
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,270
aggressive this can be this backward

59
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:29,519
kind of rows of curved teeth here this

60
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,159
is how the animal feeds doesn't have

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,370
true teeth this backward facing allow

62
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,109
food to come in easier and it has it

63
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,969
creates a much harder time for it to

64
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,500
exit it would get caught here and it

65
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:44,219
allows it to be worked into the organism

66
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,229
for digestion the basic body plan you

67
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:47,550
can see here again there's not so much

68
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:49,319
going on here that we need to kind of

69
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,969
worry about no these for purposes of

70
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,459
this class but we may be doing

71
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:56,310
dissections of animals within this

72
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,530
phylum so this might be a good area to

73
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,680
kind of come back and refer to you just

74
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,719
have kind of a general idea of how this

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,540
body system compares to some others that

76
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,819
I talked about in other videos lastly

77
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,560
here are Cielo mates they have an outer

78
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,289
surface of the mantle that secretes a

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,699
protective shell I mean not every Cielo

80
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:19,679
mates with that for one moment several

81
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:22,019
species here have can no longer have

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,689
shells but many do so again it's a

83
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,240
distinguishing feature but those that do

84
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:29,819
have shells in the outer surface it's

85
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,070
access protection and there's multiple

86
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,650
layers and it's comprised of protein

87
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,389
calcium and pearl and so if you've ever

88
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,010
opened in this case a clam it's kind of

89
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,049
got that nice shiny pearl like look

90
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:42,689
that's because it is composed of some

91
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,760
pearl substance there's many species in

92
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,219
various forms this is an illustration

93
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,590
that shows you not the anatomy of an

94
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:54,620
aquatic gastropod so again this is just

95
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,620
one example of this very diverse phylum
