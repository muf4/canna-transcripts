1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
here I'm going to go over pruning of

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,490
cannabis and while there may be

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,068
different techniques for the most part

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,929
in the end the goal is the same to kind

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,139
of trim out the plant to make it more

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,480
productive so looking at plant pruning

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,278
in general it involves selectively

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,289
removing portions of the plant with the

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,420
goal to allow the plant to only put its

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,910
energy into parts that will produce its

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,380
greatest yields I want to cut off the

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,368
ones that are just not going to produce

13
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,299
well so can focus its energy elsewhere

14
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:31,768
different methods can result in

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,299
different flowering times so keep that

16
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:35,369
in mind that if you are switching or

17
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,049
pruning nothing it could adjust your

18
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,909
entire growth cycle and your flowering

19
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,799
times I'm going to be sure to clean your

20
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,718
tools and wash them frequently to reduce

21
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,009
the potential for cross-contamination as

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,689
you move from plant to plant

23
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,119
if one plant does have an internal

24
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,070
vascular disease you want to have your

25
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,198
tools be the transmission to go through

26
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,600
and infect all the plants down that well

27
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,609
and also while it can be fun to prune

28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,890
initially and you kind of enjoy moving

29
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,960
plant material don't get prune happy and

30
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,179
cut I call the Charlie Brown plant where

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,739
you look back at the plant and go if I

32
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,829
should have taken that much of it so

33
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,060
just keep that in mind also the goal for

34
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:10,739
pruning is you want to remove the weak

35
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,228
branches so this can be referred to as

36
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,640
freshening up at the plant these poor

37
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:16,379
yielding portions should be removed

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,000
because they're hurting your yields

39
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,259
overall and they themselves are not

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,478
going to produce all that well

41
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,000
dead or dying leaves should be removed

42
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,829
it's like the one pictured here on a

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,049
regular basis again to reduce the chance

44
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,328
of disease and that is a technically a

45
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,970
form of pruning be sure to discard these

46
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,039
leaves away from the main crop and by

47
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,658
removing these leaves and and weak

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,250
branches in general you can also

49
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,880
increase the air circulation in your

50
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,228
plant these are all great benefits some

51
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,819
people say well I'm not gonna prune you

52
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,959
know what's the downfall if I just kind

53
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:47,758
of let the plant grow and do its own

54
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,099
thing well this can increase plant

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,469
density which is advantageous in small

56
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,149
spaces it's most beneficial if your

57
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:56,489
plants are growing under three feet tall

58
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,629
in the short season so there are options

59
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:59,699
where you potentially can get away with

60
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:02,368
not pruning but it's not really the most

61
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,840
efficient method I should state should

62
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,430
still take care of you move older leaves

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,170
that are browning there's good harbour

64
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,118
disease or potential for insects

65
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,530
the downfall when you don't prune is you

66
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,409
have this kind of situation that could

67
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,469
develop we have poor air circulation

68
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,969
mainly

69
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,859
will not get adequate light penetration

70
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:18,810
this can make them you know reduce the

71
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,370
productivity the plant in general but

72
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,960
also get into some cases here we have

73
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,150
the opposite or if you don't prune

74
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,070
plants to get really leggy you're not

75
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,480
kind of pruning them to kind of take

76
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,250
away the apical meristem to make them

77
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,949
kind of grow outward a little bit more

78
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,289
so that's a potential another downfall

79
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:37,530
again depending what cultivar or what

80
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:39,060
plant stock you're using it's also plant

81
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,979
topping this involves removal of the

82
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,560
main chute to create two stronger and

83
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:46,319
shoots to develop so removal the apical

84
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,539
dominance or that main stalk is

85
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,909
advantageous because then you can have

86
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,409
now a two-litre system this is coming

87
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,750
for poinsettias and this is referred to

88
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:57,780
as pinching the plant this removes the

89
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,060
presence of a dense top bud but overall

90
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,740
yield will not be that negatively

91
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,680
impacted because now you're gonna have

92
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,180
more buds growing off these branches and

93
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,650
the port leader system is kind of like

94
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,500
what I just showed is kinda do it twice

95
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,140
remove the top dominant apical meristem

96
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,969
allow for four main branches to grow the

97
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,458
goal here to produce a large dense but

98
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:19,620
at the flower tops training these newly

99
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,450
developed four leaders is needed to

100
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,099
maximize the benefits of this pruning

101
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:24,149
style so again this does require a

102
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,699
little bit of a commitment throughout

103
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,489
the season and you gotta kind of set

104
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,979
your plant up early for this then

105
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,629
there's the film technique and it seems

106
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,119
4fi missed

107
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,000
instead of clearly removing the top grow

108
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,709
that I got showed in the previous one

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,900
just below the bud the traditional

110
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,189
method the bottom 10% of the butter is

111
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,890
actually gonna remain with this

112
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:49,289
technique this allows for different

113
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,298
growing tops to form kind of see that's

114
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,250
evident here a little bit the zoomed in

115
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,920
version here this can induce the

116
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,750
emergence of eight or more branches this

117
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,518
is beneficial in producing many branches

118
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,379
especially if you're looking at cloning

119
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,230
it's often used with the what's called

120
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,509
the screen of green style of growing but

121
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,909
very common for cloning simply because

122
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:09,929
you have so many branch points Nevin

123
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,340
would say will help me just don't want

124
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,739
to have all these branch points all the

125
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,019
time is this can have more branch points

126
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,009
correct but it could potentially reduce

127
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,269
total size of each of those buds

128
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,519
there's the bending of the plants less

129
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,530
stress on plants and pruning just his

130
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,180
name implies the branches are bent to

131
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:28,619
the ground and staked and play

132
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,780
this can be used to kind of jump plants

133
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,699
around it's called tip propagation used

134
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,500
with raspberries sometimes this is not

135
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,420
quite the full bending the plants

136
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,910
technique but gives you the idea of kind

137
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,710
of setting that plant up potentially to

138
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,180
go to that technique now it's more

139
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,949
commonly those plans so they get close

140
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,509
to the light source with a limited

141
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,129
ceiling height so you know that one

142
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,839
branch is getting a little bit high and

143
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:50,670
kind of branch it kind of Bend that

144
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,649
branch over to keep it away from the

145
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,650
light but not lose anything on that

146
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:57,779
particular side shoot there's a sea of

147
00:04:55,649 --> 00:05:00,120
green SOG focuses on flowering plants

148
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,469
early can be done at one foot or about

149
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,930
thirty centimeters tall with the goal of

150
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,790
producing fewer but larger buds which is

151
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,699
kind of an example here come with town

152
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:12,060
and grow spaces that are growing a high

153
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,969
plant density then there's a screen of

154
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,639
green and this uses mesh screen netting

155
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,800
it's layered horizontally you see here

156
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,019
above the plants and the growing tips

157
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,669
grow through that material typically

158
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,918
players must remain in a vegetative

159
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:27,779
state a little bit longer several more

160
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,060
weeks than the previous sea of green

161
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,439
that I had mentioned so again this is an

162
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,418
outdoor operation a little bit better

163
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,399
for this area look not quite as height

164
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:37,049
limited a little bit longer growing

165
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:40,259
season so again you have to choose what

166
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,000
fits your particular operation there's

167
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,829
something called lolli popping and this

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,180
is a technique that involves removing

169
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:47,250
the lower growth of the plant that

170
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,370
receives little to no light could see

171
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,779
this down the whole grow facility the

172
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,090
goal is to have plants make the most

173
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,279
uses energy it produces by having it

174
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:58,560
focus on the upper buds and branches

175
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,659
timing of the photo period flip is based

176
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,280
on cultivar and height for plants make

177
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,050
the slips for indicas about three three

178
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,179
and a half feet to revive more time for

179
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,530
the vegetative state and sativas you tip

180
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,418
some we want to flip maybe a little bit

181
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,459
earlier they're almost sometimes half

182
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,409
the height since they can grow much

183
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,209
taller during the flowering phase this

184
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,910
might be a little bit specific to the

185
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:20,069
particular cultivars you are growing

186
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,860
within the indica of the city folk

187
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,870
classification lastly here we have super

188
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,370
cropping the goals produced very heavy

189
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,740
yields with minimal number of plants

190
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,800
it's accomplished this by the plants

191
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,629
that yield that are held higher in the

192
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,610
vegetative phase longer super cropping

193
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:37,918
involves bending the upper branches see

194
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,528
here this 90 degree angle occurs right

195
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,658
here down so it allow for more light

196
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:44,519
to reach deeper into lower parts of the

197
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:46,889
plant but keeping the plant material

198
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,048
away from the lights this allows the

199
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,239
extended vegetative phase with minimal

200
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:54,438
leaf burn and this is referred to as

201
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:54,438
super cropping
