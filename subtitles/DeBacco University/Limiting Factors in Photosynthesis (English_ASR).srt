1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,068
okay heroic the looming factors in

2
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:07,289
photosynthesis we've looked at

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:08,699
biological systems and there's always

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,559
some sort of limiting factor that's

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,829
involved we're a look at that as more of

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:16,048
a micro scale here specifically we're

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,629
look at light intensity Kerman acid

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:21,570
concentration and also temperature and

9
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:24,960
how this impacts the rate of horses

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,240
synthesis strong with limiting factor in

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,760
the general sense a lumen fit factor

12
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,439
these can be resources in environmental

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,719
conditions that restrict growth

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,030
abundance or distribution of an organism

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,609
or a population of organisms in an

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,129
ecosystem we've talked about predators

17
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:44,488
before physical barriers particular

18
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:47,609
biomes speed limits all these impacts

19
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:49,709
are limiting factors to an individual

20
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:54,509
we're now going to take this and look at

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:57,840
more of a micro scale here so late

22
00:00:54,509 --> 00:01:00,479
intensity so light energy is necessary

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,670
for photosynthesis and as it applies in

24
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,679
the name flow to meeting light but the

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,990
intensity of light can vary due to

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,540
weather for example is it a cloudy day

27
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,849
is it a sunny day is it a foggy morning

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,490
how is that impact impacting the light

29
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:17,158
intensity the location of the plant is

30
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:20,489
it in a large open field is it near some

31
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,350
rocks is it under large trees different

32
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,000
areas is it on the north side of the

33
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,489
building the south side this could

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,500
impact the intensity that that was light

35
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,649
that that plant may have received also

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,569
the season spring summer winter or fall

37
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:36,090
it can impact the light intensity based

38
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:37,769
on the angle of the Sun relative season

39
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,740
of nearby plants what this means is if

40
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:41,819
your plant living under a deciduous tree

41
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:44,158
they drop their leaves in the fall

42
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,019
meaning in the winter and early spring

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,380
that plant will we serve a greater

44
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:52,289
intensity looking at our light intensity

45
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:54,239
to a photosynthetic rate graph unless as

46
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,149
light intensity increases from A to B

47
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,548
the rate of opposed synthesis will also

48
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,239
increase however this is not continuous

49
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,540
and forever

50
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,099
when we reach here our maximum rate even

51
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,320
if the light becomes brighter from B to

52
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:10,109
C the light is brighter the rate of

53
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:14,030
photosynthesis will remain the same we

54
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,050
reach that plateau or that maximum rate

55
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,289
now light intensity follows this

56
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,180
particular inverse square law and what

57
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:22,949
this is the inverse square law is a

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,599
specified intensity is inversely

59
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:27,239
proportional to the square of the

60
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,489
distance from the source what does this

61
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,430
mean kind of a little easier terms here

62
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,490
energy twice as far from the source it's

63
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,469
right out over four times the area so

64
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,810
we'll notice here with our light and as

65
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,389
we get further away take an exponential

66
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,580
decrease in the intensity of light you

67
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,859
can see that here with our candle in our

68
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,750
book on our clock and getting as we get

69
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,780
further away the intensive that light

70
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,340
drops off significantly and we see that

71
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,680
here the little mathematical here the

72
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,629
inverse square of the sphere we've got

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,360
our area and it's being spread out over

74
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:03,359
that four times the area as the distance

75
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,820
becomes twice as far so this is part of

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,100
the reason why light decreases so

77
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:12,359
quickly because it's an inverse square

78
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:14,819
law now lights met readings in the

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,250
called power PA are I'm flow

80
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,629
synthetically active radiation and it

81
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,530
says made for the spectral range or

82
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,019
waveband

83
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,840
of solar radiation from 400 to 700

84
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,379
nanometers that photosynthetic organisms

85
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,590
are able to use and process of

86
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:32,370
photosynthesis

87
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,099
now this 408 to 700 nanometers be from

88
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,969
specific wavelengths the 400 you can see

89
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:42,840
here verses 7 and 800 and we notice on

90
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:45,930
our graph over here that or the

91
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,140
wavelengths are not all used by the same

92
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,629
pigments in a plant's CR chlorophyll b

93
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,699
chlorophyll a carotenoids are all using

94
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,949
different wavelengths this is helping

95
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:59,789
the plant be able to use a greater

96
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:01,828
portion of this spectrum with this image

97
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:03,599
shows here we have our light intensity

98
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,430
at the center point and as we get

99
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,289
further away from that light intensity

100
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,340
you notice how quick the power may drop

101
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:13,349
off so consumed being very limited or

102
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,329
very low intensity to the parameters a

103
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:17,279
very high intensity in the center point

104
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,540
here so important for considering and

105
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,089
lighting a plant you won't have that

106
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,220
plant directly under that light because

107
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,199
the further we keep that light away the

108
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,960
less intensity of light that it will

109
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,250
receive

110
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,739
ComNet save concentration is another

111
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,209
consideration it can help limit or

112
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,460
potentially limit plant growth

113
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:37,378
so Kerman oxide is a common limiting

114
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,658
factor assuming all other factors

115
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,819
example water and lighting are not

116
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:43,468
limiting so all these limiting factors

117
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,590
assume that they're the most limiting

118
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:48,029
amongst all the other factors keep in

119
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:50,758
mind that the atmospheric percentage of

120
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:53,489
carbon acid is only about point zero

121
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,340
four percent the more carbon accident

122
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,250
plant is given the faster it can put

123
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:00,978
synthesize but this only occurs up to a

124
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,399
certain rate as we see here again

125
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:04,050
increasing the carbon dioxide

126
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,750
concentration these brackets and

127
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,180
concentration will not increase the rate

128
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,370
of post synthesis beyond that point so

129
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,590
here's our normal atmospheric air it's a

130
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,449
mixture we get some water vapor here's

131
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:17,939
our carbon dioxide these are oxygen lots

132
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:21,090
of nitrogen we're increasing our carbon

133
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:23,218
dioxide concentration from A to B listen

134
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:25,198
that a great is also increasing have

135
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:27,810
them get to see we're in that plateau

136
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,389
phase increase in carbon dioxide here at

137
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:34,668
this point is not yielding any greater

138
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:37,110
photosynthesis how this may look

139
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,519
elevated carbon dioxide concentrations

140
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,020
can increase plant growth assume

141
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,848
sunlight and nutrients are not limiting

142
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,978
factors keep in mind the average

143
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:46,680
atmospheric carbon dioxide expressed in

144
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:50,189
parts per million is approximately 410

145
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,978
so here's our ambient here these images

146
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,418
show growth with additional carbon

147
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,810
dioxide expressed in parts per million

148
00:05:54,418 --> 00:06:01,258
so ambient to be about 410 for

149
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:04,199
increasing it by additional 150 so this

150
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,588
would be about 500 in 60 parts per

151
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,028
million

152
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:08,370
notice that plants grown a little bit

153
00:06:06,028 --> 00:06:10,468
better we releasing 300 parts per

154
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,228
million from ambient better growth and

155
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:15,149
450 parts were almost doubling the

156
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:17,218
amount of carbon dioxide present in the

157
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:19,769
natural atmosphere we noticed a gross

158
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:22,110
difference that does occur same thing

159
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:24,180
here is 196 this is about half of the

160
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,930
normal carbon oxide in the atmosphere

161
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,848
and here's 752 a study done on average

162
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,918
growth response to 300 parts per minute

163
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,689
of additional carbon dioxide you can

164
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,120
look at all the some of the data

165
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:38,908
provided here and pretty much it all

166
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,199
comes through an increase in some

167
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:44,098
average

168
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,830
anywhere from an average of 32.8% to as

169
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:50,128
high as 70% for trees increasing the

170
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:52,709
ambient carbon dioxide levels so this is

171
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:54,689
one way assuming again water nutrients

172
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:57,799
and lights are all not limiting factors

173
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:59,879
to help increase yields of plants

174
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,069
temperatures the last one chemical

175
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,229
reactions office photosynthesis are

176
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,210
impacted by temperature the rate in

177
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:07,769
temperature are directly proportional

178
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:10,620
meaning as temperature increases so does

179
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:12,838
the photosynthetic rate however since

180
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,329
this is a biological system there's an

181
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:18,509
optimum temperature pretty much for most

182
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:21,478
plants any rate above or any temperature

183
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:25,069
above 86 degrees Fahrenheit it's going

184
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:27,568
to be the maximum rate of photosynthesis

185
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:30,060
anything above or below that it's going

186
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:31,889
to be below maximum now if we get too

187
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,620
high we notice that our rate does drop

188
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,838
off significantly proteins are starting

189
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,379
denature and there's other issues below

190
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:43,019
86 there's just not enough energy to

191
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,449
move those molecules fast enough 86 is

192
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,468
considered the optimum temperature

193
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:48,838
anything above that again we see a

194
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:53,459
dramatic decrease and below that we're

195
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:54,990
noticing an increase up to that point so

196
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,968
the general summary here just to put it

197
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,468
in graphical form how does light carbon

198
00:07:56,968 --> 00:08:00,509
oxide and temperature impact the rate of

199
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:02,699
photosynthesis we can see how light

200
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:06,419
impacts it in carbon dioxide have very

201
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,218
similar graphs and temperature has that

202
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:08,668
optimum again around 86 degrees

203
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:11,788
Fahrenheit

204
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:14,158
and post and dedicated be lower at

205
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:17,028
temperatures greater than 86 or less

206
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:17,028
than 86 degrees
