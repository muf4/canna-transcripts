1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,129
for those that developing a product that

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:08,220
they can ultimately sell to consumers

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:09,750
the packaging is important so for

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,750
chemists we're going to score some brief

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,330
cannabis packaging it's a way to kind of

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,410
market your product in what things you

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,160
should be looking for whether you're a

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,609
consumer or a producer in this case so

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,980
product packaging heavy-duty bags cans

10
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:27,599
containers can all be used typically if

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,519
you're looking for a long-term storage

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,559
they'll be nitrogen filled this is an

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,570
inert gas to help preserve the product

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,879
it's an example of a canned here can be

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,609
used in seeable bags even my nitrogen is

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,920
the most high gas of highest abundance

17
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,890
in the atmosphere these nitrogen fill

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,390
bags will be filled with near 100%

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:49,530
nitrogen there that just helps increase

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,239
the longevity of the product now within

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,149
the product packaging I want to keep

22
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,250
light out however a customer viewing

23
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,640
window is strongly encouraged as this

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,289
can allow for inspections by your

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,359
consumer without opening or breaking the

26
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,219
seal of the package so the seals are

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
very important I want to make sure

28
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:08,670
you're keeping those contents under

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,250
controlled conditions but take their

30
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,260
nitrogen filled but the consumer still

31
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,420
wants a way to view them so much like an

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,340
agro tank here we're viewing window you

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,810
can peek in and see what you might be

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,909
purchasing I might be growing in this

35
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,129
case the same thing should be applied to

36
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,070
packaging this window does not to be you

37
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:28,079
know super large but an area where the

38
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,419
consumer can look in and inspect the

39
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,519
product that they are looking to

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,650
potentially purchased without damaging

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:37,590
the seal ruining all the work that was

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,618
done to increase the longevity of that

43
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,180
product branding ensuring your customer

44
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,578
knows where their canvas is coming from

45
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,860
is important bringing your product as a

46
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,679
result and having it be effective is

47
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,478
important to you as a grower remember

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,630
though this can work to help or hurt you

49
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,938
so ensure that there's a quality product

50
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,519
inside in a consistent product inside

51
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,289
and if you produce a poor product and

52
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,700
people associate your name with poor

53
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,810
products that's going to work against

54
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,420
you but if you brand your cannabis and

55
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,098
consumers like it and it gets sold that

56
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,379
can be much to your benefit in the long

57
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:15,269
term mark

58
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,030
so not gonna get too much into this but

59
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,270
container size that you use the shape

60
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,340
the color the design of the label all

61
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,680
play into marketing the picture here for

62
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,719
right elbow food star I'm just showing

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,330
you all the different marketing that

64
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,639
occurs with all the different fruits and

65
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,440
vegetables and products here there are

66
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,500
many many options and while this is

67
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,210
important your first priority a priority

68
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,860
number one should be the actual product

69
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,210
if you're not producing a quality

70
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,070
product if you're reducing a so-so

71
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,460
product doesn't matter how good your

72
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:49,620
marketing is if it's not that great but

73
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,360
product they won't get sold people may

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,950
try it initially because of the great

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
you know advertisement or the great

76
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:56,579
color or shape of the container or label

77
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,800
but ultimately if they find to be poor

78
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,620
quality they will typically seek out

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,420
better quality product so that should be

80
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,099
your first step but you should still

81
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,709
have someone dedicated into marketing

82
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,840
and consider this because it can be a

83
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,330
very competitive environment out there

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,789
so you want to make sure that your high

85
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,890
quality product is being put in front of

86
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:19,229
as many consumers as possible to help

87
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,069
increase sales to drive the business

88
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:22,069
model that you have
