1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,958
okay here I'm gonna go over the very

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,609
basics of plant breeding and first and

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,798
foremost there's kind of two ways to

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,388
look at this there's a traditional way

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,669
which is what I'm gonna focus on here

6
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,169
where you have a donor variety strand

7
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,469
and recipient you're kind of getting

8
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,240
that mix of that new variety and we have

9
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,460
genetic engineering which is we're

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,489
taking these very specific desired gene

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,859
and very precisely inserting it into the

12
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:27,479
DNA sequence so this is still breeding

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,910
as you are still producing a new

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,250
individual but in this case if they're

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,530
very directed and only producing that

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,409
desired gene being transferred at one

17
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,058
time traditional is kind of that many

18
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,738
genes are transferred and the hope is

19
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,539
that desired gene will carry over and

20
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,308
here's that desire gene hope that desire

21
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,140
gene is carried over but there's also a

22
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:47,280
nice mother carry over she make

23
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,320
engineering is going to take them to

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,179
just that desire gene they only insert

25
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,289
that one we're gonna again focus a

26
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,170
little bit more the traditional breeding

27
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,609
here so a pure reading lines so starting

28
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,730
with the basics this is established

29
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,019
lines that come true from seed in order

30
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,109
for this to happen there needs to be a

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,969
limited amount of variation and reduced

32
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:07,650
amounts i gossiped ii the genetics need

33
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,688
to be either homozygous dominant or

34
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,150
homozygous recessive

35
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:14,158
this is different than clones because

36
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,219
clones are taking the same plant

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,840
material here we're having a male and

38
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,640
female are having a crossbreeding that's

39
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,400
occurring but essentially all of the

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,618
offspring are the same so there would

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,140
not be high variability at the x over

42
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,759
the puppies here pure breeding lines is

43
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,909
always going to kind of come true from

44
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,140
type whatever you get in the parents

45
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,700
here across to parents are going to be

46
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,530
very similar and you're gonna get

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,060
basically the same thing as a result

48
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,890
you're not going to get different colors

49
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,399
different splotches on different coat

50
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,989
patterns now for other terms use just

51
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,629
crossing selfing and sipping these are

52
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,009
common terms used within growers and use

53
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,228
when they're generating seeds are doing

54
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,599
crosses so the first are obvious one is

55
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,218
crossbreeding this is simple breeding of

56
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,478
two different variety gather and this

57
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:01,548
can create the highest degree of genetic

58
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:03,420
variability here we see a homozygous

59
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:06,420
recessive green color

60
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,449
Peapod and here we see a heterozygous

61
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,580
Peapod with one with yellow being

62
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,530
dominant we cross these together and we

63
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,840
see the variability that we get not only

64
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,599
and phenotype how they look but also in

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,520
genotype even kind of see the same thing

66
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,400
down here we're looking at our punnett

67
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,140
square we have two purple flowers both

68
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,330
heterozygotes I mean they both contain

69
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:31,289
this other recessive gene when we bring

70
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:34,319
these together we get 75% or 3 out of 4

71
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:37,289
phenotypes will be purple one will have

72
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:40,679
a white phenotype if we look at the

73
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:42,629
genotypes one is homozygous dominant at

74
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,629
a for one out of four will be homozygous

75
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:48,000
recessive and two will be heterozygotes

76
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:51,120
this means that this will always produce

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,280
the purple gene if it's bred with

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
another homozygous dominant all their

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,340
offspring will be considered to pure

80
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,659
breeding the same goes for the pure

81
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,700
breeding white here where they're

82
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,659
homozygous recessive these they'll

83
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,449
create a little bit more variability

84
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:05,400
just as we see here so again phenotype

85
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:08,899
genotype crossbreeding will kind of

86
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,340
create the highest degree of variability

87
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,689
something called sailfin this is the

88
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,030
name implies it's taking pollen

89
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:17,068
fertilizing the same plant no in canvas

90
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,319
this is because their money assistance

91
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:20,669
is very difficult to do this is the

92
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,039
concept of kind of getting that

93
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:25,530
feminized seen sort of speak this

94
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,828
selfing in general as you see here with

95
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,930
a lily flower this restricts the genetic

96
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,360
variability of the offspring you simply

97
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,969
have the male pollen fertilizing the

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,940
same female here so this is gonna limit

99
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:41,129
the genetic variability sitting this is

100
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,889
taking two seeds from the same plant and

101
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:46,139
that's the same individual plan and

102
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,599
using one plant for pollen and the other

103
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,219
for the flower this is a way to create a

104
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,769
small amount of variability because they

105
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:55,739
both came from the exact same original

106
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,689
plant in the offspring so you're getting

107
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,069
some variability but not a lot this is

108
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:00,840
kind of you looking at maybe refining

109
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:04,829
something or selecting for something

110
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,420
more specific so what's a hybrid so I

111
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,469
use corn as an example this hybrid corn

112
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,319
is probably pretty well known and

113
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:12,359
understood hybrids are botanically

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,030
different as an offspring from two

115
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:17,549
plants that are different species or

116
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,988
varieties so what this actually does

117
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,389
what the hybrid does it creates a

118
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,609
mixture of genetics and is often the

119
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,769
results of some crossbreeding

120
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,850
depending on what plants specifically

121
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,829
cross bred so what is this kind of

122
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,960
an example we consider these two

123
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:34,240
different corn plants that were

124
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,279
crossbreeding together this one produces

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,340
very small kernel system produces very

126
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,469
large kernels but it's kind of a smaller

127
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:44,289
cob itself we can crossbreed these to

128
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:47,290
develop a hybrid this hybrid has larger

129
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:50,290
kernels but more of this longer shape to

130
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:52,090
it and maybe has a greater area so this

131
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,370
is the resultant to be a hybrid we're

132
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:57,699
kind of seeing evidence of both of the

133
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,079
parents resulting in the offspring then

134
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,629
we can do something called f1 hybrid

135
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:03,339
synthesis hybrid vigor it's thought to

136
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:06,670
produce seeds or plants that are 25%

137
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:09,519
bigger than either parent alone well how

138
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,379
is an f1 hybrid example here as it's

139
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,259
accomplished well by developing two

140
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:16,180
distinctly stable breeding lines we have

141
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:19,420
violet and white flowers for obvious

142
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,850
examples we would self cross these for

143
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,650
about seven to nine generations and self

144
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,080
across white flowers in this example for

145
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:29,289
seven to nine generations after we have

146
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,000
these two isolated generations we breed

147
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,300
them together we would cross these

148
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,970
together to ideally hopefully create the

149
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,860
best of both worlds in the resulting f1

150
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,240
offspring so what does this kind of look

151
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,150
like in real life well this is kind of a

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,160
nice example here that I found we're

153
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:46,899
seeing seeds offer hybrid vigor which

154
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,270
can not be obtained directly from a

155
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:51,250
clone hybrids are created by crossing to

156
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:53,199
true reading parents to produce f1 seeds

157
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,300
and grow more vigorous in each parent

158
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,149
let me see parent one on this side

159
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,970
parent two on this side these are corn

160
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:02,109
plants this is the hybrid here so we

161
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,040
could see as we go through this

162
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:09,040
time-lapse showing the progression and

163
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,280
see this this plant here tends to

164
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,720
produce bigger and better than either of

165
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:17,979
the lines that it was used to breed with

166
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,290
and again isn't growing the full terms

167
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,300
is growing for about a little over 30

168
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,730
days we can see even from the beginning

169
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,220
the wider leaves the bigger plant then

170
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,620
either of the offspring there so again

171
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,300
just interested to see how hybrid vigor

172
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,870
can play out and this is something you

173
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,550
cannot get from clones lastly here's

174
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,110
something called the f2 generation well

175
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,790
this is further generations are just

176
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,379
continuations of the original breeding

177
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,840
lineage and it's tracked through

178
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:46,600
family treatment pedigree the downfall

179
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,359
is a resulting f2 generations offspring

180
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,680
may vary greatly from the f1 parents so

181
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,930
we take a pure breeding line a pure

182
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,509
breeding line that kind of self that 479

183
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,030
generations we get our hybrid vigor but

184
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,889
then if we plant that seeds from that f1

185
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:02,769
generation we do get something that may

186
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,349
revert back to one of the original so

187
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:07,240
just keep that in mind if you ever have

188
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,520
some hybrid plants or hybrid tomatoes it

189
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,560
you grow you save the seeds you may get

190
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,659
offspring that look nothing like the

191
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,100
original because it's reverting back to

192
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,100
one of the original generations
