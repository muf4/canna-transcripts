1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,960

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,080
tobacco university video will go over

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,080
just that

6
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:20,160
[Music]

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,000
all right let's get into what does a

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,359
head grower at a cannabis facility

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,679
actually do

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,240
so first off their general uh job

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,800
description well they manage all aspects

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,119
of cultivation including budgeting

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,280
they're ahead of all growers and all

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,599
cultivators and their job is basically

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,760
to oversee the crops from the seed all

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,920
the way up to and including the

17
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,839
harvesting procedure

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,520
now their day-to-day activities again

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
will always kind of be a little bit

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,359
variable depending on the size of the

21
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,280
operation where their plans are but they

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,039
basically will oversee daily growing

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,280
operations and they ensure all

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,120
documentation is complete and accurate

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
and documentation is a very important

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,198
component of the cannabis industry they

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,239
will also issue corrective and

28
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,640
preventive actions called kappas work

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,880
with laboratory employees in creating a

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,280
production schedule and maintain and

31
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,399
conduct vault inventory and again this

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,719
might depend on the size of the

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,520
operation they're also responsible for

34
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,280
overseeing the the cure room operations

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,959
and conducting employee training from

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
entry level all the way up to upper

37
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,959
level create maintain standard operating

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,478
procedures and ensure the safety

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,959
requirements for staff

40
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,118
and product are maintained they're kind

41
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,640
of like the one that is responsible for

42
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,040
all aspects of

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,280
the plant growing process now there will

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
be of lower entry level growers and

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,799
responsible more for the day to day

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
everyone just call it quote grunt work

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
here the head grower

48
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,478
really all the responsibility comes down

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,640
to them at the end of the day

50
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,679
so the qualities that a head grower must

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
have is typically a bachelor's degree

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,720
knowledge and experience with the

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
american herbal

54
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,280
pharmacopia as far as knowing their

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
practices

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,920
in

57
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,560
extensive knowledge of the harvest and

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,439
care of medicinal marijuana plants in

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
general

60
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,639
requirements are 21 years of age or

61
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,000
older

62
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,439
pass a criminal background check good

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,038
communication skills and good

64
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,639
organization skills

65
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,238
the organization skills are very

66
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,559
important because you need to have the

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,959
ability to document all of the different

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,239
aspects regarding the entire growing

69
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,520
process

70
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,200
now the connection of the cannabis

71
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,760
industry just kind of how this head

72
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,359
grower ties in is that they are the head

73
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,679
of the entire growing operation after

74
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,400
the name comes from therefore they have

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,239
over oversight over all other growers

76
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
and complete control so that's why the

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,640
responsibility lands on their shoulders

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,080
when they make a decision that's why

79
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,839
it's going to proceed forward hopefully

80
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
for the better but if it's not it

81
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,878
doesn't work out as favorable they take

82
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,560
the blame

83
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,159
any slight mistake from the head grower

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
could potentially harm the consumer so

85
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,479
redundancy and quality control are key

86
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
in this position and that documentation

87
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,318
is very important and it's important to

88
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,839
be involved with the plants yes a lot of

89
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,679
head growers can get caught up in a lot

90
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,598
of the other aspects of growing it's

91
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
important for them also to have a direct

92
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,439
plant connections as well as well as

93
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,840
those communication skills to hear from

94
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,120
those might be lower on the list there

95
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,439
hearing what they're seeing making

96
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,360
adjustments catching problems early and

97
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,719
preventing them from becoming larger

98
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
problems because ultimately the

99
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,759
responsibility all comes back to the

100
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,759
head grower
