00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,080
this tobacco university video is going

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,480
to look at the identification

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,359
and control of fungus gnats related to

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,359
cannabis plants

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,199
[Music]

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,800
all right let's go over how to identify

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,480
and control gnats on

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,719
cannabis plants particularly fungus

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,760
gnats so let's start off with a

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,239
description here

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,840
fungus gnat larvae need wet conditions

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,639
to thrive and are typically found

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,719
growing in

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,320
the substrates and typically near the

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,320
kind of surface of those

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,558
substrates you can see here the fungus

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,280
now larvae how it looks and then we see

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,159
the adult

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,480
uh now in the actual soil here we see

20
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,039
one actually affixed to a yellow sticky

21
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,599
card

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,479
which are used are hung in and around

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
plants

24
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,078
to capture insects so that growers can

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
identify or know

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,759
what's in the area as far as pest

27
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,519
pressure goes

28
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,599
now the identification here we see a

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,280
large yellow sticky trap with all sorts

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,960
of fungus gnats attached to it

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,439
those yellow sticky cards can be helpful

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,079
for early detection however you can also

33
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,640
use

34
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,920
sliced potatoes placed near the soil or

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,599
substrate surface

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,200
as it should only take about four to

37
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,679
eight hours for maggots if they're

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,840
present

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,118
to find the potatoes so if you're

40
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,079
looking for something that you can just

41
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,680
easily go

42
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,200
maybe right in the kitchen and grab take

43
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,159
some potatoes slice them up put them

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,560
near the plant

45
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,359
and you should know very quickly if you

46
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,920
have any

47
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,118
fungus maggots it's because the insects

48
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,879
tend to feed on the roots of the

49
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,719
cannabis plant so placing it near the

50
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,078
soil substrate structure

51
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,000
will put it near where they are and

52
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:38,559
they're very likely to find this

53
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,239
basic area here to feed on as well

54
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,478
now a good about managing them so how to

55
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,399
go about managing fungus gnats

56
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,519
well wet substrate surface is key to

57
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
their proliferation

58
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,519
so sometimes putting a layer of sand or

59
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
rice holes on the surface of a container

60
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,239
substrate

61
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,478
will reduce the surface moisture and

62
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,118
thus result in less fungus gnats

63
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,000
keeping that real high surface moisture

64
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,438
very wet

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
really increases the likelihood and

66
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,039
pressure of your plants will have

67
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,399
fungus gnats in general keeping that

68
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,399
substrate surface dry

69
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,680
is important for their control so those

70
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,520
rice holes are sand

71
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
dry very easily let water pour through

72
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,480
very easily keeping the upper layer dry

73
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,920
will reduce the pressure of fungus gnats

74
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,000
on your plants

75
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,639
some do suggest application applications

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,959
of bacillus thuringiensis or bt

77
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,759
can be helpful but really that moisture

78
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,598
is key

79
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,759
the last resort should be insecticides

80
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,238
that contain pyrethrum

81
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,518
in neem oil as these need several soil

82
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,599
based applications

83
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,680
and can also damage the plant roots as

84
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,518
well so i want to avoid those at

85
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
all cost start with the environmental

86
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,200
change reducing the moisture

87
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,318
hopefully that will take care of your

88
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,959
numbers especially

89
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,958
if you're able to identify them early
