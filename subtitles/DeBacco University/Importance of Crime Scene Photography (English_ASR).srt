1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,878
Photography is very important for

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,589
crime-scene investigation if you're the

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:09,570
head person responsible for taking

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,250
photographs that's extremely important

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,440
here's something that's involved being

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,019
able to take good photographs is also a

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,118
very important skill to have because it

8
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:20,219
would be very helpful now you do not

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,469
need the most expensive of camera gear

10
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,299
or equipment we're gonna go over some of

11
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:26,969
the key photographs you need to be

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,640
considering or taking when investigating

13
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,678
a crime scene so first off the basic

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,808
rules never move an object before

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,488
photographing it and this doesn't mean

16
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:37,558
just take one quick picture and move on

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,890
you can may want to take it from

18
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,808
multiple angles you might be looking at

19
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,579
multiple zoom in multiple areas you

20
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,140
might be photographing again depending

21
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,058
with that object maybe I think that's

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,920
important even if you don't deem it

23
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:51,718
important to begin with it's very

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,300
important to take pictures before you

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,100
move it the key thing to remember when

26
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,709
in doubt take a photograph especially

27
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,070
now with the digital age of photographs

28
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,780
it's carry here extra memory cards and

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,159
make sure you got plenty of space and

30
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,960
just take a lot of pictures now

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,490
photograph advantages the reason why we

32
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,529
take a lot of pictures is it's a quick

33
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:15,868
method of documentation that's very

34
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,420
accurate generates interest and can be

35
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,849
used as evidence digital images can be

36
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,710
enhanced and also stored want to be

37
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:25,109
careful on you know how far we enhance

38
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:27,239
them but the key part is they can be

39
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,978
stored for a long periods of time how

40
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,929
they can be backed up and this is all

41
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:34,438
important especially if a crime scene

42
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,390
gets reinvestigated later so the age of

43
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:39,359
digital photography you know could be

44
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,060
the larger cameras or even just phones

45
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:46,170
as well in some way documenting that

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,240
what was seen so some of the

47
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,009
disadvantages though of photography so

48
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,478
it's not all pros they can be altered

49
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,000
that's one to be careful of you know

50
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:57,000
modifying them a distortion is possible

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,950
and perspective can add an influence so

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,868
we're not creates a scene that you know

53
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,090
through modifications that didn't really

54
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:04,799
occur nor do we want to just capture one

55
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,350
thing without maybe taking into account

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,580
something else that occurred there so

57
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,038
they're not perfect but they are

58
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,640
definitely a major piece it's expected

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,259
of documentation for crime scenes

60
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,488
so perspective is everything so I

61
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:20,348
mentioned this where are we got to be

62
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:21,959
careful on how we take pictures you know

63
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:24,009
looking like the baby is large feet

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,810
person holding the plane it's really

65
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:27,969
just coming in for a landing look quick

66
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,489
here else there's pigs feet and properly

67
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,229
placed flags here off of the swimmer so

68
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:34,299
perspective is everything we want to be

69
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:36,429
mindful not just focusing maybe on one

70
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:38,438
thing gonna be focused on the entire

71
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,390
scene to make sure we're not causing

72
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:42,669
some sort of false story or false

73
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:46,208
depiction or what might be going on in

74
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:48,699
that image so types of photographs will

75
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,680
live establishing photographs mid medium

76
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:53,229
range of photographs close-up in

77
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,909
macroscopic photographs we're kind of

78
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:56,828
gonna break those down and kind of roll

79
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,929
represented right here basically we want

80
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,219
to establish the scene we want to get to

81
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,290
an area where maybe something came in

82
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:03,579
this doorway a close-up look so it may

83
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,798
have occurred it may be more of a

84
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:07,480
macroscopic view maybe the details of

85
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,340
what's going on there so that

86
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,289
establishing photograph depicts an

87
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,150
overall view of the scene this can

88
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:15,039
include a broad shot the buildings the

89
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,260
approach to escape routes witnesses and

90
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,229
etc so here we're gonna be focusing on

91
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:23,259
here justice gives you an idea is looks

92
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:24,848
like a the high school here a car nearby

93
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:26,828
you know where to be focusing on the

94
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:28,840
doorway here but kind of give us an idea

95
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:30,189
okay maybe someone could pull up here

96
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,930
very easily

97
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:33,669
there's park benches near the convened

98
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,269
witnesses check the front of the school

99
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:38,169
so this kind of establishes the area

100
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,730
getting a little bit closer to said

101
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,769
we're focusing on that door in this case

102
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:43,899
this is the medium range of photograph

103
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,849
shows the relationship between objects

104
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,919
with the concentration on the immediate

105
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:50,018
scene who shows a relationship of

106
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,250
evidence in a given space so while we're

107
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,019
focused on the door now that we're a

108
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,329
little bit closer you see that there's

109
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,849
some sort of water hose here that could

110
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,989
plate into it out it could be some could

111
00:03:57,848 --> 00:04:01,840
have tripped on it so I'm gonna move

112
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,370
that there could be soil that's left

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,590
behind it could be some sort of movement

114
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,959
some sort of trace elements also the

115
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,150
door is propped open so maybe there

116
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,729
could be fingerprints on here I'll look

117
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:16,090
at the close proximity here to a corner

118
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:17,530
so this this all gives us ideas and that

119
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,259
relationship of how these objects may

120
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,908
interrelate we need to close up

121
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,490
photography this is depicts a single

122
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:26,889
item as evidence and oftentimes these

123
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,730
are included from multiple angles so

124
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,230
here we're seeing the door

125
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,759
popped up with this piece of wood could

126
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,560
take it from another angle taking it

127
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,899
we're really focused on just that one

128
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,810
piece of evidence there that maybe this

129
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:40,839
was added by someone to kind of allow

130
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,610
for easy access in and out there are

131
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,159
macroscopic so they're not microscopic

132
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,170
macroscopic this is an extreme closeup

133
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,720
of very small objects in which the size

134
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,400
of the subject is in in the photograph

135
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,570
is greater than life in size so here

136
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,909
we're looking just as an example of a

137
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:56,829
fly you can see a lot of great details

138
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,250
that's going on it's great for this

139
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:02,589
evidence this type of photograph is

140
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,410
evidence for showing that fine detail

141
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:07,179
defying the subpoenas to find hairs can

142
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,720
really get at something that might be

143
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,569
needed as trace evidence for example so

144
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,090
I'll photographs need include a size

145
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:18,730
reference to help establish that so now

146
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:21,009
I'll always do we have this advantage of

147
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,069
having the ruler but we could have the

148
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:26,860
need for putting a dollar bill that's

149
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:29,829
six inches long or something of known

150
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,600
size pocket knife or just something a

151
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,849
quarter a penny some that we know the

152
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,920
size of so that it can be determined and

153
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,379
easily measured as we get the size

154
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,270
general idea the perspective of the size

155
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:43,740
of whatever object we're looking at

156
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:46,389
hopefully this is helpful looking at our

157
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,560
information about photography and how

158
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,560
important it is for crime scenes
