1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,359
here we're going to look at the analysis

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,519
of inks

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,878
particularly in pens and while you may

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,080
think they're all the same

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,320
there's actually some unique

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,199
characteristics and identifiable

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,839
characteristics

8
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,439
that can be applied to forensic science

9
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,600
so first off just a general ink

10
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,079
comparisons if you've got this kind of

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,679
container here with a bunch of pens well

12
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,038
inks in question documents may be

13
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,039
examined and compared

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,199
with other inks of the same document or

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,160
with ink in other documents

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,559
even with ink that's in seized pens so

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,000
this is important to consider

18
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,159
collecting if you're collecting evidence

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
to be collecting pens from the area

20
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,000
of the crime scene because the goal is

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,960
to determine where the similarities and

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,920
differences

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,039
potentially may exist so when we're

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,840
talking about comparing

25
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,320
inks if an old document has newer ink or

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,160
alter

27
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,238
alterations to that ink it could be

28
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,078
determined if you look at kind of the

29
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,238
straight copy here everything looks the

30
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
same but there are certain techniques

31
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,078
that we can do to determine what might

32
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,038
be a different ink what might be a new

33
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,600
ink

34
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,799
and it can allow us to see some changes

35
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,920
that may have been made

36
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,400
in a questioned document so just in

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,719
general

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,478
what is ink inks are a complex mixture

39
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,840
of colors and additives

40
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,239
in a simple diagram describing the

41
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,000
selective reflectance of a pigment

42
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,679
so we have kind of we'll say say white

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,920
light with all wavelengths hitting our

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,118
ink surface it's only it's absorbing

45
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
these different colors

46
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,959
and reflecting in this case the blue

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,840
color so we'll interpret that as

48
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,359
blue ink now we look at a little more

49
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,680
technical kind of terms

50
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,719
to identify ink components scientists

51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,600
can use

52
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,000
infrared or mass spec or chromatography

53
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,719
in both the glass gas or liquid phase

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
this can help determine a signature to

55
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,039
that

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,399
ink what particular components and

57
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,280
ingredients are being used

58
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,960
to specifically identify that one

59
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,879
particular ink

60
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,959
well why would we have this high degree

61
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,679
of specificity well there's actually an

62
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,399
international

63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,159
inc library where a lot of inks from

64
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,718
different manufacturers

65
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,320
are stored it's maintained by the us

66
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,438
secret service and the international

67
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,839
revenue service

68
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,399
includes more than five hundred ing

69
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,800
steaming back to the 1920s

70
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,400
every year pen and ink manufacturers are

71
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,280
asked to submit a new ink

72
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,680
if they have new formulations so this is

73
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,120
a

74
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,760
giant library of inks that can allow

75
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,439
pinpointing of if a pen was used to try

76
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,639
to identify

77
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:31,280
what time period that pen came from

78
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,279
and how that might be able to impact the

79
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,280
materials found at the crime scene

80
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,878
these are chemically tested and added to

81
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,878
the reference for collection

82
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,639
and this is what develops this library

83
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,759
which allows for this

84
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,759
great database to be used for comparison

85
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,639
when we're trying to identify certain

86
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,639
inks
