1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,680
okay regarding water pressure and volume

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:06,719
I wanna go over just a couple terms that

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,039
are used for each so you can understand

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,650
them when they're applied in different

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,449
situations so you put this picture here

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,888
of a firefighters fighting the fire with

7
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,138
water pressure and versus volume

8
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:19,500
pressure is referring to that force

9
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:21,509
that's occurring on the hose here I'm

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,550
going out to extremes to fire and the

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,220
volume is just simply that the amount of

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,469
water being applied so let's first look

13
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,169
at water pressure it's measured in

14
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,879
pounds per square inch that's psi and

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,190
it's typically see it's PSI that again

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,140
stands for pounds per square inch

17
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:39,689
typical home water pressure is about 40

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,670
to 50 psi an excessive water pressure

19
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,960
can lead to leaks so we don't want to

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,820
have just more pressure isn't always

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,739
better that pressure is coming from

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,899
those molecules bouncing against on the

23
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:50,759
container the sides here pressure

24
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,469
regulators can help insure that pipe

25
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,119
pressure doesn't exceed a certain amount

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,850
they can be important for irrigation

27
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,488
systems however regularly regulators are

28
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,198
mechanical usually in nature and it

29
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:03,479
should be changed outs as they can wear

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,920
out over time I'm you know if you're

31
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,719
having an increase in pressure and you

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,189
have a regular still in place that

33
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,609
regulator is old you might want to

34
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:13,469
change that out and also buy some water

35
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,599
pressure gauges here so you can have an

36
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,728
idea if that regulator is actually

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,199
wearing out over time the other one I

38
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,519
mentioned here is water volume and

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,978
that's a measure of the amount of water

40
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,079
that can be delivered over a set time it

41
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,489
can be thought of as the flow rate so

42
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,328
typically it's dated as gallons per

43
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:32,250
minute GPM or gallons per hour gph this

44
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:34,349
can be impacted by the diameter of the

45
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,000
pipe used that can affect the amount of

46
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:38,009
gallons you can deliver in one minute or

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,478
one hour the minimum flow rate would be

48
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,368
about five gallons per minute for many

49
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,920
irrigation systems you want to work in

50
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:46,530
some way calculate this so you know what

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,509
your volume is your flow rate this is

52
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,649
very easy to do you simply get a

53
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,078
five-gallon pail

54
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,859
make sure it's marked I get the hose

55
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,809
ready get a timer and start the timer

56
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,239
start to fill in the bucket up and see

57
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,920
how far you can get it in a set amount

58
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,399
of time and you can factor that out for

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,920
a minute

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,030
you do it for 30 seconds to just figure

61
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,350
out what your flow rate is because

62
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,409
that's going to be used in a lot of

63
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,030
irrigation calculations as far as what

64
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,889
you can actually run and what the flow

65
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,759
rate is of your system

66
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,069
so hopefully that was helpful to

67
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,469
arriving the volume versus pressure

68
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:22,079
water because it is applied to a lot of

69
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:24,439
situations with plants in irrigation in

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,440
general
