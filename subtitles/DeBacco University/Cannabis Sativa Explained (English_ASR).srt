00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,080
video here we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,400
some of the details behind cannabis

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,480
sativa i'm going to be explaining some

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,679
of the morphological characteristics

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,400
where it might be used

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,960
some advantages as well as some of its

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,439
disadvantages as a strain in general

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,439
so looking first at the origin well this

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,439
isn't the annual herbaceous flowering

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,559
plant it's in goodness to eastern asia

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,439
but is now very

13
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,278
widespread throughout the entire globe

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,879
this is probably where it originated

15
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,640
from it's been cultivated throughout

16
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,759
recorded history and it's been

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,439
has a very diverse history of its use

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,039
it's been used for industrial fiber seed

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,640
oil food recreation

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,079
religious and spiritual foods and

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
medicine there's a whole bunch of

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,759
different uses that's been used for

23
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,959
each part of the plant is harvested

24
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,920
differently depending on what the

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,920
purpose of the use

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,640
is and it was first classified by carl

27
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,439
linnaeus in 1753

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,359
and the word sativa means things that

29
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,000
are cultivated so it applies to kind of

30
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,039
a lot of other

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,719
plants indicas and other flowering

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,799
plants just in general but

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,920
the sativa is thought to be one of the

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,960
more original

35
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,799
ones there the morphology of these

36
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,118
sativa strains they're typically very

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,720
tall growing 14 to 15 feet tall

38
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,400
their internode spacing is about three

39
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,400
to six inches and their leaves if you

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
took one off would be very long and thin

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,320
compared to some of the other strains

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
make sure you have the height to grow in

43
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,199
the area if you are planning on growing

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,000
a sativa a

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,759
strain of cannabis however remember that

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,840
they're also photoperiod dependent which

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,599
can limit their height so careful timing

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,118
and planting for outdoor locations or

49
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,679
manipulation of photo period

50
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,159
for an indoor location can to some

51
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
degree

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,479
limit their overall height that they

53
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,240
achieve now popular cultivation

54
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,799
locations for sativas

55
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,000
are outdoors because of the areas with

56
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,118
long growing season because of the

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,959
height that they get

58
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,560
this season also prefer to get maximum

59
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,158
yield from this type of plant

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,519
others will time it to be later in the

61
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,200
season to limit the height due to the

62
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,560
change in the natural photo period

63
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,560
if you are growing in a greenhouse or

64
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,879
high tunnel or something as a ceiling

65
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,079
limit there's also the possibility to be

66
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,399
mindful

67
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,318
for the potential limitations of how

68
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,840
tall that plant could get so it may

69
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,439
outgrow your location

70
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,039
pruning is recommended to help increase

71
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,000
the plant efficiency and ultimately the

72
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,000
yields

73
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,759
if you're wondering what are some common

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,439
sativa cultivars well there are many

75
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,000
it's an extensive list

76
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,800
a one is high in thc but sour diesel

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
very common

78
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
or famous on the east coast united

79
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,160
states as well as many

80
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,238
many others that just provided a quick

81
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,280
list of three there for some comma

82
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:37,519
sativa cultivars to help you understand

83
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,519
ones that fall into this classification
