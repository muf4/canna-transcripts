00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,839
in this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:04,480
going to go over should you be changing

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,160
rooms

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,680
or should be changing conditions within

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,839
the room when you're flipping your

6
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,839
cannabis plants from the vegetative

7
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,839
to the flowering phase of growth and

8
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,800
production

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,320
[Music]

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,760
all right let's go over changing rooms

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,480
or what should you change conditions

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,160
within the room for cannabis flipping

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
so first off when you're changing the

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,399
room well this in this case growers will

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
maintain conditions in the

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,600
same in the room which causes the need

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
to move plants

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,039
when growers want plants to be exposed

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
to different conditions as you're taking

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,039
your plants from one room that's under

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,480
one set of

22
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,039
parameters and conditions environment

23
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,799
and moving them to another as different

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,239
parameters and conditions this is

25
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,320
efficient when it comes to lighting and

26
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,799
cooling needs because it's all set up

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,399
and all climate controlled the downfall

28
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,000
is the need to physically move those

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,640
plants which could result in damage

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,119
also labor and working them from one

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,439
area

32
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,198
to another this is why some growers will

33
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,158
choose to change the conditions within

34
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:05,518
the room

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,359
and this allows plants to stay in the

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,200
same physical location but the

37
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,040
conditions must be changed by the grower

38
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,640
we must be altering or have a way

39
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240
of altering those environmental

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,920
conditions because those plants

41
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,079
have different requirements as they go

42
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,159
through the aging process

43
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,519
so it's not just veg to flower when

44
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,080
we're talking about this transition

45
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,840
to occur the largest change in plants is

46
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,679
from veg to flower but these same

47
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,000
concepts can be applied to other

48
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,520
stage changes that the plants go through

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,959
because another key transition point is

50
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,319
from the propagation phase

51
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,000
to the vegetative stage where we're

52
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,559
going from the seedling or small clone

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,599
phase

54
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,439
to kind of that true vegetative phase

55
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,719
that can be another alteration that

56
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,438
occurs in the

57
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,200
environment so changing the room when

58
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,199
we're looking at changing the room

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,560
when certain when certain specific

60
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,719
conditions are dialed in

61
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,560
by an indoor grower often this comes at

62
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,840
the result of many pieces of equipment

63
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680
working in conjunction

64
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,359
with one another the lighting the

65
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,960
heating the hvac the

66
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,959
next enrichment a lot of factors come

67
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,478
into play this can be quite a challenge

68
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,000
since once the systems are dialed in

69
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:10,639
making changes can offset this balance

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,159
this is why some growers tend to set up

71
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,359
a room get it all dialed in

72
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,120
and have another room with different

73
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,120
conditions all dialed in and then simply

74
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,239
move the plants into or out of

75
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,080
how they want them to be exposed to so

76
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,759
the moving the plants well with the

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,280
environment being set when a grower

78
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,560
wants to change the conditions plants

79
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,000
need to be moved

80
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,439
often the type of lighting and the

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,039
cooling system can be important and

82
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,159
these two systems are in competition

83
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,679
with one another

84
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,120
this typically occurs when the plants

85
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,000
are transitioning from the vegetative

86
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,800
growth cycle

87
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
to the flowering phase growers do need

88
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,519
to be careful when

89
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,878
it comes to moving plants since often

90
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,680
they need to pass through a small

91
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,518
doorway

92
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,719
you need to move down a hallway we want

93
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,080
to make sure that they're well staked

94
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,439
they're well supported

95
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,719
before we're going through and making

96
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:55,039
that move or that physical transition

97
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,878
so those dedicated flower rooms so often

98
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,400
the flower rooms gets the attention

99
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,000
and this is where the final product is

100
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,319
harvested but remember

101
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,080
flower rooms vegetative propagation dry

102
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,598
all are important rooms

103
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
in these rooms to fly rooms to humidity

104
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,518
control is extra important to reduce the

105
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,640
chance of bud rot developing or botrytis

106
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,039
especially late in the season or late in

107
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,719
plant development so when you're

108
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,318
changing the conditions

109
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,840
keep in mind that when growers decide to

110
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,439
change the environmental conditions in a

111
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,439
room so the plants can stay in the same

112
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,039
physical place we need to have a way to

113
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,199
completely alter those

114
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,959
however changing should not be

115
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,359
distracted to use

116
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
advanced plant stress so if we're

117
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,000
changing from

118
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,598
one environmental condition to another

119
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,280
that drastic change

120
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,878
we don't have that drastic change occur

121
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,680
in just one

122
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,719
two hour period i want to slowly reduce

123
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,319
and change

124
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,799
so this plants are not exposed to a

125
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,399
drastic stress

126
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
growers also need systems to check to

127
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,920
make sure the change is made or what is

128
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,798
expected and the systems are able to

129
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,719
maintain

130
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,920
those plant favorable conditions just

131
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,438
because you check it once and you go

132
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,039
okay that looks perfectly good

133
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,639
now let's go through and just assume it

134
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,158
all went to plan might want to make some

135
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,639
alterations there here we're seeing a

136
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,679
change

137
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,359
in humidity in 24 hours um quite

138
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,400
drastically so we want to be sure we're

139
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,799
prepared for that

140
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,319
and are able to have our plants make

141
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,360
that transition and for it to be

142
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,798
favorable for their growth and

143
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,400
development

144
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,358
now either method is the same result

145
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,198
whether you're changing the room or

146
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,879
changing the conditions within the room

147
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,800
it doesn't matter what method is

148
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,478
implemented since if done correctly

149
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
plant performance will be the same

150
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,680
however for ease for the grower

151
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,879
sometimes having those independent rooms

152
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
if it's an option

153
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,159
is tend to be favored because it really

154
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,399
allows

155
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,439
conditions to be set and only the plants

156
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,679
to go through that

157
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,680
alteration of the environment
