1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,949
okay here oh look at the plant hormone

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:07,830
ethylene but you don't realize that this

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,990
one you may have experience with before

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,699
even if didn't realize it was this

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,519
particular hormone that was doing it so

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,919
to start off with ethylene plays a role

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,170
in fruit ripening so here we have an

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,480
apples acid and soured Starkiller

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,910
chlorophyll and pectins hard and large

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,829
molecules when we had ethylene it can

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,170
activate a bunch of enzymes who knows

12
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:31,259
all these and in the ACE indicating that

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,559
their enzymes and we can develop a ripe

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,210
apple now which is neutral pH has a lot

15
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,070
of sugar instead of starch less

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,289
chlorophyll less peckmon so it's offer

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,270
and increased fragrance notes with our

18
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,820
banana here it's going from a green

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,760
banana all the way to a ripe banana to

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,520
an overly ripe banana this is showing an

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:54,718
increase in ethylene that is causing

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,730
this ripening to occur so ethylene what

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,399
is it it's a smallest hormone it

24
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,108
typically is this as a gas it's

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,058
important for seed germination fruit

26
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,570
ripening and abscission of leaves that

27
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,829
means leaves get basically fall off

28
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:10,969
we're noticing here our fruit ripening

29
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:13,349
the stage of a fruit and our ethylene

30
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,908
concentrations here those in the green

31
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:17,099
or unripe stage are ethylene production

32
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,109
is quite low then others have a large

33
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,269
spike as we get closer to ripening and

34
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,118
at peak ripeness your notes and the high

35
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:26,699
amount of ethylene produced now that's a

36
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,349
slow decrease over time here but we

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,960
notice that those where the fruit is

38
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:35,459
ripe the ethylene is much higher than it

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,868
is when it is unripe so looking at the

40
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,899
functions of ethylene well I mentioned

41
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:42,509
that a decision person it has a rapid

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,280
diffusion so ethylene can work in the

43
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,109
leaf here the obsessions hindered the

44
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,420
shedding phase where the leaf is dropped

45
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:49,890
off deathly can actually block it to

46
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,728
this kind of line here means block

47
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,439
auxins from from activating nuts with a

48
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:57,509
lot of hormones or interactions between

49
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,489
them i'm gonna try to focus on this with

50
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,799
these specific hormones do or what

51
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,298
they're kind of known for and ethylene

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,340
because it's a gas can diffuse very

53
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,039
rapidly

54
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,420
also affects adjacent individuals so we

55
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,559
come up with the same which you may have

56
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,799
heard of one that apple spoils the bunch

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,240
and this

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,090
because one bad apple is gonna produce

59
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,800
high amounts of ethylene that ethylene

60
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,870
is going to affect the adjacent

61
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,460
individuals so this one bad apple is

62
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,409
going to cause the apples adjacent to

63
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,760
ripen which those are gonna cause ones

64
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:28,319
basement another ripening and it's gonna

65
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:31,349
spread throughout the entire barrel or

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,780
area here we go back here to senescence

67
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,710
in abscission that's where the leaves

68
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,479
senesce is where they're being broken

69
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,250
down and obsessions where they're

70
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,289
actually falling off the plant and

71
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,539
that's ethylene is involved in that

72
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:43,769
process in in the end the one bad apple

73
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,169
spoils the bunch of nuts because of

74
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,400
ethylene one bad apples gonna ripen all

75
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:52,199
the other apples now this could be used

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,689
to our advantage if you've ever had a

77
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,639
hard peach or unripe bananas that you

78
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:57,930
want to speed up the ripening may have

79
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,129
heard you put them in a brown paper bag

80
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,990
and let them sit for a day or two

81
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:03,479
that'll speed up the ripening process

82
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,550
that brown paper bag is trapping in the

83
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,769
ethylene causing that fruit to ripen a

84
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,600
little bit faster so the brown paper

85
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,159
bags something you might have put fruit

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,719
in miraculously they come out and

87
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,879
they're softer especially peaches and

88
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,219
nectarines well that's because of the

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,709
ethylene production that's being kept in

90
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,979
a closed confined area speeding up the

91
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,939
ripening process lastly with ethylene

92
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,609
there's something called a triple

93
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,739
responds this triple responds indicated

94
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,390
here we have zero ethylene concentration

95
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,700
of parts per million more slowly

96
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:34,649
increasing them keep in mind all home

97
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,229
was working very small quantities so

98
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,569
here the triple responds well I think

99
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,369
inhibits stem elongation who knows hairs

100
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,370
were increasing our concentration the

101
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,439
elongation of the stem is being reduced

102
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,780
the stem is being thickened compared

103
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,900
this stem diameter to this stem name of

104
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,430
the highest ethylene concentration and

105
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,500
lastly a third part of the triple

106
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,870
responds horizontal growth of the stem

107
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,789
as a concentration of ethylene increases

108
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,560
we see that here was shaved upright

109
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:03,030
growth with no ethylene as we're

110
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,670
increasing the ethylene we're noticing

111
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,209
that stem is slowly starting to bend to

112
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:10,829
the side there it's also thickening and

113
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,959
we're noticing some there

114
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,780
the leaves are being different

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,209
maturation rates they're also so

116
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,910
hormones despite their very small size

117
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:23,100
and typically very small concentrations

118
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,490
can have a large influence on plant

119
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,490
behavior
