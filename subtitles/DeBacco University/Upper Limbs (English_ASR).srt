1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,119
okay here we'll be looking at the upper

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,200
limbs of

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,200
the body and to provide you some

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,320
information and some comparisons between

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,759
those uh bones

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,798
in particular so first off those upper

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,120
limb region what do they consist of well

8
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,358
the

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,879
they consist of about 30 bones in three

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,039
regions your arm or

11
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,559
shoulder to elbow your forearm your ulna

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,359
and your radius and your wrist and your

13
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,198
hand

14
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,519
the upper limbs consist of the humerus

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,359
which is that upper arm portion here

16
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,118
radius and all on the forearm you have

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,960
eight bones inside your carpals

18
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,479
five bones and your metacarpals and

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,399
fourteen bones in your

20
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,000
phalanges you can kind of see them

21
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,439
listed here in this

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,359
image as well now we have the humerus

23
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,718
which is a bone of the upper arm i'm

24
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,640
talking right in this region

25
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,879
here it runs from the shoulder to the

26
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
elbow approximately it articulates with

27
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:51,839
the

28
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,520
scapula from the shoulder joint and

29
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
distally articulates with the radius and

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,680
ulna

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,238
at the at the elbow joint again see that

32
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,079
here

33
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,320
and it's highlighted in red in this

34
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,079
image

35
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
now looking specifically at the forearm

36
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,560
contains those two bones

37
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520
looking over here the ulna and the

38
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,280
radius

39
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,959
so a lot of people confuse these two so

40
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,478
hopefully i'll be able to provide some

41
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,399
clarification

42
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,679
now the radius all the extend parallel

43
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,719
from the elbow where they articulate

44
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
with the humerus

45
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,840
uh and the wrist the humerus and the

46
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,798
wrist

47
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,079
the radius is larger than the ulna so

48
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,040
that's kind of like your big

49
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,519
taco message of the radius being larger

50
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,840
than the

51
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,039
oma not to try to put it here in bold

52
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
and small

53
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
and you can see them listed right here

54
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
and this might be a little hard to tell

55
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,319
but i think here you can kind of see

56
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,040
radius compared to

57
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,879
the ulna and atomically the radius is

58
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
located laterally to the ulna

59
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,560
placing it near the thumb you can see

60
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,159
that here so the radius if you're

61
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,118
looking at your hand

62
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,000
race would be located near your thumb

63
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,399
and the ulna would be

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,599
on the other side and atomically the

65
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,718
ulna is located immediately to the

66
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,118
radius placing it

67
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,118
near the little finger again so your

68
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,040
radius would be closer to your thumb

69
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,159
and your ulna would be located closer to

70
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,560
your pinky

71
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,599
finger so now looking at pronation and

72
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
supination

73
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,159
so pronation and the forearm is the

74
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,120
rotational movement where the hand

75
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,560
and upper arm are turned inwards so if

76
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,680
we're looking here this is where you can

77
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
because if you feel

78
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,120
if you hold your hand here you can feel

79
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
that a bone is moving

80
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,039
and that is basically the radius rolling

81
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
over the ulna

82
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,159
supination is the forearm occurring when

83
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
the forearm and palm are rotated

84
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,519
outwards

85
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
that's kind of exposing the palm when

86
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
both bones are essentially

87
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,039
parallel to one another it's considered

88
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,719
to be the standard position

89
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,318
so if you ever see an image of anyone

90
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,919
their palms are usually facing out

91
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,000
because that keeps the bones

92
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,598
parallel and that's considered the

93
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,598
standard position
