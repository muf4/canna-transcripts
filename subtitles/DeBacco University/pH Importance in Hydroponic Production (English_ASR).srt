1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,019
if you are going to be participating in

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,139
growing plants hydroponically should be

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,449
very familiar in well versed with pH and

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,279
what it means and keep a close eye and

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:14,308
monitoring and also know how to adjust

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,198
it pH is the number one concern with any

7
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:18,300
operation but it's especially the case

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,070
with hydroponic setups because there's a

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,769
lack of buffer factors it can result in

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,439
quick changes in pH keep in mind that

11
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:27,750
it's a tenfold increase for every number

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,550
so if you're just two numbers off and

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,980
where you want to be that's that there's

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,840
two places that's a hundred full

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,399
difference in the hydrogen ion

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,219
concentrations and that can largely

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,350
affect and impact the nutrient

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,850
availability to your plants again

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,710
there's lack of buffer factors that

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,359
typically are more present in soil based

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,378
conditions if you are transitioning from

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:51,808
a soil base to a purely hydroponic base

23
00:00:48,378 --> 00:00:55,019
you're gonna realize that pure water has

24
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,549
just about no buffering capacities as a

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,710
result the grow needs to keep a close

26
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:00,780
eye on this and people monitor and know

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,780
how to adjust it and not let it get too

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,540
far out of the ideal range because if it

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,040
does it will drastically impact the

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,320
nutrient availability to the plants it

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,189
can also burn or kill the crop if a

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,188
growers not careful
