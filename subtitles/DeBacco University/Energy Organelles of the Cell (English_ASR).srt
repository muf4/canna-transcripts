1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,000
every cell needs to kind of produce

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,679
energy to be for an organism to be able

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,439
to survive so we're going to look at

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,759
some of those organelles

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,719
responsible for producing some of that

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,080
energy

7
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:13,759
in plants we have most notably the

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,839
chloroplast and then we have everyone's

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,079
favorite the mitochondria

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,920
so first off chloroplasts are the

11
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,239
contain chlorophyll those green pigments

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,320
that

13
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,559
allow to capture solar energy you can

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,800
see even with a light microscope you can

15
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,518
easily pick them out and see them as

16
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,199
they're very well defined in the cell

17
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,799
now chloroplast what's unique about them

18
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,719
is that they are they are

19
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,919
mobile they can actually change position

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,039
to maximize

21
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,840
their ability to capture sunlight so top

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,079
view here

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
in kind of sideways view in dark

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,280
environments those chloroplasts will

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
move kind of towards the top

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,879
so that they're able to try to maximize

27
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,320
as much light as possible

28
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:51,759
and if there's too much light they can

29
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,600
actually move to the side or kind of

30
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,439
work their way through

31
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,280
the um the cells a little bit more

32
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,759
diffused but when they want to maximize

33
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,000
the light

34
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,519
absorption they can actually move within

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,679
the cell

36
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,920
now these chloroplasts are originated as

37
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,840
endosomatic

38
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,599
cyanobacterium so they retain their own

39
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
independent genome and there's some

40
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,959
evidence to suggest

41
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,199
they may have once been free living and

42
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,759
are now through the endosymbatic theory

43
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
are now components particularly of plant

44
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,239
cells

45
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,000
so now these chloroplasts have a triple

46
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,920
membrane structure and outer and

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,040
inner membrane this again is part of the

48
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,239
reason why

49
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,600
the theory is that they may have been

50
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,359
one's free living because they already

51
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,719
have a membrane structure

52
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:35,280
this cyloquid forms disk-like structures

53
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,438
which are stacked in the form of grana

54
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,079
these kind of stacks allow for a very

55
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,158
efficient

56
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,078
surface area to volume ratio to allow

57
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
for exchange of materials

58
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,919
and then they're suspended within the

59
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,240
semi fluid of the stroma

60
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,439
so you can see here and also located

61
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,879
here now there's a lot of chemical

62
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,478
reactions as i mentioned

63
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,879
so we want to be able to have a lot of

64
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,640
surface area for them to occur

65
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,078
this is a zoomed in version here again

66
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
showing you kind of these like discs

67
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,399
that are on top of one another

68
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,439
allowing for that a lot of area for

69
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
these

70
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,478
chemical reactions to occur which are

71
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,399
very important because we want to be

72
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,080
efficient with our energy production

73
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,680
within the cells

74
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,280
now chloroplasts are probably most

75
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,560
familiar with process

76
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,959
of the photosynthetic process involved

77
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,199
with taking carbon dioxide

78
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,680
water with light energy and producing

79
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,598
sugars and oxygen as a byproduct

80
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,599
only plants algae and certain bacteria

81
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,439
are capable of going through this

82
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,878
process chlorophyll and other pigments

83
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,959
capture solar energy

84
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,239
and enzymes are ultimately used to

85
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,800
synthesize carbohydrates or sugars

86
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,000
now this site of photosynthesis their

87
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,680
carbohydrates

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
are being formed from carbon dioxide and

89
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,080
water cells making its own

90
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,840
food using this carbo using this carbon

91
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,280
dioxide here

92
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
you can see that kind of membrane here

93
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,000
and this exchange that's occurring

94
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,000
this photon energy this light energy is

95
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,158
driving the breaking down of water

96
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,680
producing oxygen these hydrogen ions

97
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,919
which are ultimately being used to

98
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,959
produce atp and nadph

99
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,318
both energy molecules and being used to

100
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,439
synthesize or create

101
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,199
carbohydrates now that structure here as

102
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,598
i mentioned the stroma the aqueous fluid

103
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,958
we see the thylakoid we see the grana

104
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,399
the thyroid being the individual

105
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,800
component the ground up being a stack of

106
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,039
those

107
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,680
thylakoids and the multiple membranes

108
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,239
here we also have the lumen which is the

109
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,040
um kind of semi-fluid area located

110
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
within

111
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,719
the thylakoid now we get onto the

112
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,518
mitochondria

113
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,639
it's originated also as an endosomic

114
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,000
eubacterium

115
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,079
since it has its own dna it has multiple

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,519
layers multiple membranes indicating may

117
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
have once been free of living

118
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,959
the mitochondria are smaller than a

119
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,318
chloroplast and they contain ribosomes

120
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,878
in their own dna

121
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,318
and they remain in independent genome

122
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,239
it's highly variable among

123
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,560
species so that's kind of interesting

124
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,200
fact about the mitochondria

125
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,280
it's involved in cellular respiration

126
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,000
produces most of the atp utilized by the

127
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,360
cell

128
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,639
a lot of people say it's you know it's

129
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,040
the powerhouse of the cell well it's

130
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,359
really

131
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,719
the site of cellular respiration or the

132
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,840
breaking down of sugar

133
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,680
to form energy so mitochondria is

134
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,280
surrounded by this double membranes and

135
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,560
outer and inner much as we saw with the

136
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,039
chloroplast

137
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,798
these folds again allow for a lot of

138
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,719
surface area to volume ratio

139
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,159
on the cristae surrounds the matrix the

140
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,079
matrix is the inner semi

141
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
fluid containing respiratory enzymes

142
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,280
these proteins

143
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,359
involved in this energy production

144
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,959
process and how they're generating that

145
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,600
energy is by breaking down carbohydrates

146
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,198
this energy production that occurs um is

147
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,360
fatty acid metabolism there's also the

148
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,879
krebs cycle or the citric acid cycle

149
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,600
and it's through the process of what's

150
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,199
called oxidative phosphorylation

151
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,199
you're having these kind of all these

152
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,960
components within these membranes

153
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,120
going through and isolating different

154
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,319
components allowing them to create

155
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
gradients to then

156
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,759
ultimately generate atp which is the

157
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,439
energy currency of the cell

158
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,360
lastly as i said that mitochondria is

159
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,399
the site of cellular respiration or

160
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,000
it's a site of atp synthesis

161
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,599
powerhouse just kind of cuts it a little

162
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,038
bit short for what it's actually able to

163
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
produce

164
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,560
it's a double membrane this is kind of

165
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,719
what they look like i'm looking at a

166
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,199
transmission electron microscope

167
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,800
just say there's folds in there there's

168
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,560
enzymes in there help the breakdown of

169
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,680
those carbohydrates

170
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,000
and ultimately producing atp which is

171
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
the energy currency of all cells and

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,879
