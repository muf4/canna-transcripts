00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,318
going to go over cannabis

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,919
social equity council at least that was

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,719

great information

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,640
as this is something other states might

9
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,640
be considering

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,720
[Music]

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,400
all right so let's get into cannabis

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,000
social equity council that was

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,919
established in connecticut in july

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
2021. if you're looking for more

15

is the actual link provided right here

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,520
and also information presented is based

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,039
on uh

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,200
cannabis information provided by the

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,759
state of connecticut from july 1st

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,480
to july 28 2021 just a couple days

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,399
before

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,078
the recording of this video in an effort

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,359
to give everyone the most up-to-date and

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,799
current information

26
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,558
now while this does only apply to

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,159
connecticut and subject to change

28
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,558
you should be sure to check your current

29
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,319
and local regulations this is only

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,599
intended to be used as a point in time

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,719
general example so questions that are

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,478
often asked

33
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,079
regarding cannabis in this particular

34
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,959
topic is how

35
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,200
is which neighborhoods were most

36
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,118
impacted by the war on drugs determined

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,280
that is part of the establishment of

38
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,478
this council and the law looks at past

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,239
drug convictions and current

40
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,798
unemployment rates to determine which

41
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,478
areas

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,720
were disproportionately impacted by the

43
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:27,438
war on drugs called disproportionately

44
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,200
impacted areas or dias

45
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,118
the law requires social equity council

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
to release the final list of qualifying

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,478
census tracts

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,079
this is kind of the way you're going to

49
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,799
go about approaching this

50
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,679
to try to find areas that were regions

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,118
of the state that were

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,439
disproportionately impacted

53
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:46,078
and try to help them through the with

54
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,839
the positive actions within this act

55
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,679
so how does social equity council hold

56
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
itself accountable to promoting

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,880
uh equity and here we have blaming

58
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,000
someone else's line and then taking

59
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,519
accountability how are they going to

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
assume accountability

61
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,679
the council will oversee a third party

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
study to provide detailed findings on

63
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,840
or including the historical and present

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,159
day consensus of cannabis

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,118
prohibition criminalization as well as

66
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
stigmatation

67
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,639
as well as the consequences of racial

68
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
discrimination

69
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,119
in cannabis prohibition they will then

70
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,800
make recommendations regarding the

71
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,319
creation of programs to ensure that

72
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
individuals from communities that have

73
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,199
been disproportionately harmed by

74
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
cannabis prohibition

75
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,159
and enforcement are provided equal

76
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
access to licenses for cannabis

77
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,000
establishments don't want it to this

78
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,159
disproportionate to kind of continue

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and be perpetuated this is a way to

80
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,079
mitigate some of that

81
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,239
specifying additional qualifications for

82
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,640
social equity applicants as well

83
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,878
and providing expedited or priority

84
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,598
license processing for social equity

85
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,199
applicants

86
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,280
these are ways to kind of help promote

87
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,518
that equality

88
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
how will the law promote this social

89
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,680
equality then other than just what was

90
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,280
stated here well the law takes a

91
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,239
comprehensive approach to promoting

92
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,080
social quality

93
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
focused on those neighborhoods most

94
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,719
impacted by the war on drugs

95
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,400
it provides for expungement of past

96
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,479
cannabis related crimes

97
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
and reserves half of all cannabis

98
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,598
business licenses for people from

99
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,920
impacted neighborhoods

100
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,799
so that's going to help kind of promote

101
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,479
this equality amongst different areas

102
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,159
in addition more than half of the

103
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,799
revenue from cannabis sales

104
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,479
will be a dedicated to new equity fund

105
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,159
which will be invested

106
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,000
in those neighborhoods so it's going to

107
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,759
kind of help kind of feed into those

108
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,799
neighborhoods kind of help

109
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,439
kind of get that kind of balancing act

110
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,360
that is right now a little skewed

111
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,560
so what is the social quality council

112
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
well it's a new council

113
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
that will oversee the verification of

114
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,318
equity applicants creating new programs

115
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,878
to support cannabis businesses

116
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,479
and businesses in other industries and

117
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,199
manage the more general community

118
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,919
investments

119
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,839
uh derived from the cannabis tax revenue

120
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,479
again this is all part of what took the

121
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,640
time

122
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,759
to get connecticut's recreational act

123
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,238
together because there was a lot of this

124
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,079
which is

125
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,000
had never really been done before

126
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,599
implemented and incorporated

127
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
into the law so lastly when will retail

128
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,079
sales

129
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,719
begin when will kind of things go go

130
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,799
through now while it is currently 2021

131
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,560
sales should begin in late 2022 which

132
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,799
might be further off than

133
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,040
most people would like first the state

134
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,400
needs to form new social equity council

135
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,319
we'll have to set guidelines for

136
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,159
adhering to social equity

137
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,680
provisions the state will also need to

138
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
hire new staff

139
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,439
issue new regulations and oversee the

140
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,879
application licensing processing for new

141
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,600
cannabis businesses

142
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,360
all of this simply just takes time

143
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,840
further those businesses need time

144
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,879
themselves to secure funding physical

145
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,879
locations

146
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,560
local zoning approval as other elements

147
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,478
needed to start a new business in a

148
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,478
highly regulated market

149
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,240
the supply chain must also be entirely

150
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,240
licensed before sales can begin

151
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,680
and this includes the stores very

152
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,680
important testing labs

153
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,600
and growers and there must be enough

154
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,319
growing capacity to supply the retail

155
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
market

156
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,759
the governor has directed each state

157
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,399
agency to work to implement the law

158
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,199
quickly

159
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,038
while also implementing it responsibly

160
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,639
so again there's a lot that's going on

161
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,560
here a lot that's in the works

162
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,160
so again sales a little later than most

163
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,800
people thought but i think with all

164
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,759
these things

165
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,918
in place it will be good in the long run

166
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,400
and hopefully sales can meet that target

167
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,399
there of late

168
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,399
2021.
