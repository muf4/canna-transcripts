1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,919
okay here we look at three kinds of

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,990
natural selection while in general on

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,490
the natural selection process is all the

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,638
same it's actually three ways you can

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,740
classify how a population is shifting so

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,019
the first one is stabilizing selection

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,969
and humans infants with intermediate

8
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:21,390
birth weight the highest rate of

9
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:23,549
survival as we see here we can see our

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,710
birth weight and our infant mortality

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,500
rate from type decreases dramatically

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,130
but then actually heavier babies can

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,929
also be at odds for infant mortality in

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,210
chicken eggs of intermediate weight of

15
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:38,369
the highest hatching success with this

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,890
stabilizing selection is is the before

17
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,530
it's just a normal kind of curve here

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,989
and the after has a little bit steeper

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,899
incline and that kind of that more of

20
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:52,349
that peak so just comparing here percent

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,030
mortality odds are if you find out what

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,129
you weighed when you were born

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,750
Zyra probably right around seven ish

24
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,659
pounds a little bit more a little bit

25
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,469
less doesn't mean every individual below

26
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:07,459
2 pounds dies it just means that the

27
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:09,810
likelihood of mortality is increased

28
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:12,059
another type of natural selection is

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,740
called disruptive selection where before

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,019
we had this mean and this could be kind

31
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,209
of like the gray rabbit here and then

32
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:21,840
all of a sudden we get this selection

33
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:23,819
for two ends of the spectrum with bird

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,020
beaks the intermediate bird beat it

35
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,059
could be a disadvantage

36
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,039
it could be unable to open a large seeds

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,500
and too clumsy to open small seeds

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,329
sometimes that middle ground is not the

39
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,040
advantage so in this case you either

40
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:36,779
want to be a black rabbit or a white

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,079
rabbit the great ones for ever reason

42
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,640
not advantageous so this just shows this

43
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,798
disruptive selection we're taking our

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,189
meal and selecting for basically both

45
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,130
extremes then there's directional

46
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:53,158
selection this is where we're taking our

47
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:56,218
mean and we're shifting it towards the

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,450
in this case the right flies that flew

49
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:59,669
towards the light world they made from

50
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,009
the population therefore the remaining

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,200
flies made it and the experiment

52
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,569
repeated for twenty generations and

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,789
we're selecting four in this case flies

54
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,789
that were unattractive to light this is

55
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,419
shifting the mean entirely so what once

56
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:15,939
was a very low

57
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:17,559
percentage of the population now becomes

58
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:20,500
the mean or the average this is

59
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,090
directional selection so those are the

60
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,129
three types this is another graphical

61
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,840
representation again showing that

62
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,359
disruptive selection are before

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,969
population and then we're selecting for

64
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,700
both extremes as indicated here where

65
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:35,859
for whatever reason this 10 is not the

66
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,139
best color you want to be a darker or

67
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,830
lighter color our stabilizing selection

68
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:44,109
where we're noticing that that middle is

69
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,510
the best or favored upon and we're

70
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,730
selecting against the extremes an in

71
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:50,679
directional selection or once our

72
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,879
population might have been short now

73
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,750
we're shifting towards eight taller

74
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,750
population
