1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,240
we're going to look at the most simple

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,399
form

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,278
of carbon dioxide dosing and that's with

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,240
a time

6
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:12,000
timer release here to be able to

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,000
calculate the duration

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
and frequency carbon accident will be

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,920
added to the growing area

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,920
all right let's look at carbon dioxide

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,839
timed release for cannabis production

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,519
well first off by far this is the least

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,000
expensive option

14
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,640
by simply attaching a carbon dioxide

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,359
regulator

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,439
or even a co2 generator to a timer the

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,399
growth space can be enriched with carbon

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,159
dioxide

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,480
and what these are basically your cycle

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,359
timers and you set for

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,878
how long you want the timer or the timer

22
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,479
to set to be on

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,878
and then what for what duration of time

24
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,640
you want it to be off for in the sensor

25
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,640
or the timer will go through and

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,600
regulate that throughout the entire

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,039
duration now what we're noticing here

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,079
which i like about this one it has a

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,359
light sensor

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,920
so what it's going to do is it's going

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,760
to go through its cycle timer sequence

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,519
when it senses that photocell since

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
there's enough light there

34
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,519
other timers will just go through 24

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,040
hours a day this one actually has a nice

36
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,719
little sense a light sensor

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,720
to ensure you're only going to be dosing

38
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,400
carbon dioxide during the light cycle

39
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,920
which is when plants can actually

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,640
utilize it

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,640
however a word of caution without

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,118
monitoring the carbon dioxide levels

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,478
this can cause uncertainty the levels

44
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,799
could be too high

45
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,039
or too low without you knowing it you

46
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,560
will be providing only an estimation of

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,200
the carbon dioxide levels in your growth

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,118
space

49
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,118
a carbon dioxide detector should be

50
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,840
installed to avoid potentially dangerous

51
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:43,759
conditions

52
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,920
which is above 5000 parts per million of

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
carbon dioxide to human health

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,879
otherwise you're just taking random

55
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,599
guesses as far as what the carbon

56
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,199
dioxide levels are actually

57
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,478
now adjustments during the growing cycle

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,118
so if you're using this timer-based

59
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,438
system

60
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,280
keep in mind that as plants grow they'll

61
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,879
be consuming more carbon dioxide

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,118
so you want to make adjustments during

63
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,718
the grow cycle when plants are smaller

64
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,399
they're going to be using less as plants

65
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,679
get larger you might want to up the

66
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,598
either the duration

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,120
or the frequency that you'll be dosing

68
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,719
the area with carbon dioxide enrichment

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,800
now basic controller is highly

70
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,120
recommended over a timer

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,640
even getting a simple or very basic

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
timer

73
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,719
this can help provide a much more

74
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,958
accurate form of carbonxa delivery

75
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,120
want that controller because it offers

76
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,159
many advantages over estimations of just

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,759
a simple timer

78
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,680
i will have it on for this and offer

79
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,439
this duration even the most simple or

80
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,280
basic of co2 controllers

81
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,840
can be much more advantageous over a

82
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
timer for consistency in a growth setup

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,479
the cost

84
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,159
of a timer should be factored in so the

85
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,479
rest of the cost of setup equipment can

86
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,479
be

87
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,238
maximized so initially some of these

88
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,000
controllers may cost more

89
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,920
than your cycle timers but in the long

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
run it can actually save you more money

91
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,759
and also create a better growing

92
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,000
environment overall

93
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,158
so if our goal here is to maximize a

94
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,759
cannabis yield in the end

95
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,840
over the course of a growing cycle

96
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,479
campbell's plants will become many times

97
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
larger

98
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,518
than they were at this very small

99
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,120
propagation stage so it will be

100
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,920
difficult to make these adjustments with

101
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
a timer

102
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,919
as the growing season progresses if you

103
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,120
have a controller that's sensing the

104
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,479
environment

105
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,640
you can automatically make those

106
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,719
adjustments make those changes

107
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,719
to ensure the environment at least from

108
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,479
carbon dioxide enrichment standpoint

109
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,919
is consistent to your plants over the

110
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,399
entire growth cycle

111
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,399
maximizing their yield assuming all

112
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,120
other factors are not limiting

113
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,920
in this small uh additional investment

114
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,039
early on

115
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,798
can produce big yields in the end

116
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,158
of your growing cycle so it's important

117
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,920
to investigate all

118
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,840
options yes timers are great if you want

119
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,639
to explore initially but a controller

120
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,799
based system

121
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,479
with or even without fuzzy logic would

122
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,280
be highly recommended over

123
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,280
a timer recycle timer dosing system
