1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
this debaco university video is going to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,120
get into some of the details of the

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,519
terpene

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,519
pinning

5
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:15,759
[Music]

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
all right let's get into the turpin

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,160
guide for our pinning here

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
so looking at the scent location and

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,518
properties

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,079
of this particular terpene now as the

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:25,759
name kind of

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,000
implies we kind of can see it in the

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,039
term uh that kind of says that pine or

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,759
woody opening kind of like a scent to it

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,600
it's found in basil and parsley pine

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,479
nuts citrus fruits can also be found in

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,320
pine needles

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,759
and can be seeped in hot water and

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,840
consumed as a tea

20
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,679
so this is not just unique to a cannabis

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,879
plant because it is commonly found in

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,878
pine trees as well

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,039
painting actually comes in two isomers

24
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,039
or types an alpha

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,480
and a beta and the alpha which smells

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,480
like pine needles and is the most

27
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,519
commonly found terpene in nature kind of

28
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,439
important fact there

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,120
and then beta which smells like rosemary

30
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,358
basil dill or parsley

31
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,959
some herbs you might be familiar with so

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,558
just a slight change you can see the

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,198
double bond is located right here in the

34
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,798
alpha

35
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,239
double bond is located up here in the

36
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,880
beta and that does

37
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,560
change the scent properties scent as

38
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,798
well as other properties

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
so medical benefits just in general here

40
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,000
nice little summary

41
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,920
it is an antioxidant so it prevents

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,560
oxidation damage from other molecules in

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
the body

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,079
an important aspect opinion is also

45
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,240
powerful

46
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,280
bronchodilator which helps improve air

47
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,959
flow of the lungs

48
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
for those that might be suffering with

49
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,640
asthma it also has anti-inflammatory and

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,759
pain-relieving antimicrobial

51
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,478
antibacterial

52
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,879
properties pain also crosses the blood

53
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,200
brain

54
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,199
barrier improving memory and alertness

55
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,920
it also may counteract some negative

56
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,960
qualities

57
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,478
typically found with thc now if you're

58
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,759
looking for what strains might be

59
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,000
a little bit higher in this particular

60
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,799
terpene well here is in general

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,478
a kind of list here as far as to provide

62
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,600
you with a starting point as far as some

63
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,599
strains to look at

64
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,519
as well as another little summary slide

65
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,839
here if you're looking at learning more

66
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,840
about the terpene

67
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,840
