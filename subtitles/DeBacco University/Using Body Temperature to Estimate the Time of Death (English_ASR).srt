1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
okay here at tobacco university we're

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,439
going to be looking at using body

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,039
temperature to estimate the time of

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,359
death and how we would go about

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,359
calculating that

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,599
so first off we need to understand that

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,359
different parts of temperature so

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,199
we have something called the visceral

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,480
temperature which is the temperature of

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,800
the internal organs

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,560
those particularly within the abdomen

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,199
and thoracic cavity kind of those

13
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,719
interior core organs would be the

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,320
visceral temperature and that's going to

15
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,599
be an important to note when we're

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,238
looking at taking

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
temperature so when we're documenting

18
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,119
temperature

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,558
uh this is uh yes we're taking down

20
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,119
temperatures as we would like

21
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,839
anything however the pathologist or

22
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,439
coroner's

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,879
record they're going to look at the

24
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,238
temperature of the body

25
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,159
they're also going to take into into

26
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,038
account the temperature of the scene of

27
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,279
the crime

28
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,280
the weight of the victim and all other

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,120
appropriate variables to take into

30
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,359
consideration so it's not just one point

31
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,280
in temperature we're also looking at

32
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,840
the individual and the surrounding

33
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,039
conditions as well as the weight or mass

34
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,120
of that individual

35
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,198
these are then applied to a formula

36
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,118
designed to predict the time

37
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,560
since death so it's not just one

38
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:09,519
temperature immediately go through and

39
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,439
throw an equation

40
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,200
we have to consider many factors and

41
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,719
should be documenting those

42
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,960
particularly when we're taking evidence

43
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,840
down now that change

44
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:22,079
in temperature diagrams showing how the

45
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,400
liver temperature relative to the room

46
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,118
determines the time of death so ambient

47
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,799
would be the

48
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,719
room temperature we can see that taking

49
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,118
a very sharp

50
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,798
decrease here but we notice that the

51
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,400
brain temperature the forehead and the

52
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,040
liver is the slowest to

53
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,280
progress in that downward trend since

54
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,920
the temperature of a dead body falls at

55
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840
about one and a half degrees per hour

56
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,600
the 87 degree liver temperature

57
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,560
indicates the time of death was about

58
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,199
six to seven

59
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,960
hours before so again this just kind of

60
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,159
shows a graph here here's a little

61
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,919
figure and caption associated with that

62
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,479
so just be mindful that that liver

63
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,960
because it is so interior to the body

64
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,519
is the most resistant or slowest to

65
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,000
change

66
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,920
in temperature now that temperature

67
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,199
change equation

68
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,239
the usual equation is represented here

69
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,519
where we're taking 98.4 minus the

70
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,840
measured rectal temperature

71
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,120
divided by 1.5 and i'll give you the

72
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
approximate hours

73
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,400
since death this means that the body

74
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,199
drops approximately one and a half

75
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,879
degrees for each hour after death

76
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,799
keeping in mind this is looking at that

77
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,840
core temperature and this is looking

78
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,879
also at

79
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,039
our temperature taken in fahrenheit

80
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,840
because that would be 98.4 would be

81
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,000
pretty much the average or the starting

82
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,920
temperature

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,598
of the human body here we see them

84
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,399
expressed in celsius we see again

85
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,159
over time that core temperature interior

86
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,879
most is going to be the slowest to

87
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,719
change

88
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,159
so keep in mind when taking temperature

89
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,560
we want to make note where we're taking

90
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,840
it

91
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,519
we also want to take more in just the

92
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,200
temperature of the body we also want to

93
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,159
consider the environment that that body

94
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,719
was found in

95
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:00,878
to help tell the most effective story of

96
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,878
what's going on in that particular scene
