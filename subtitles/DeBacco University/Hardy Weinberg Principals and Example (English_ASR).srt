1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
all right in this video I'm going to go

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:06,089
over the hardy-weinberg principles and

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:07,980
also an example hopefully after we go

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,519
through this this graph here will make a

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,380
little bit more sense so starting with

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,298
evolution of populations evolution is a

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,039
change in allele frequencies but

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,649
hypothetically what if conditions would

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,300
cause the frequencies not to change so

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,339
in a non evolving population there's

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,560
five key factors that need to be

12
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,660
considered one has to be a very large

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,299
populations eyes with no genetic drift

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,668
there needs to be no migration in or out

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,929
of the population limiting gene flow in

16
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,789
no mutations so there's no change in the

17
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:40,799
genetics random mating so there's no

18
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,109
selection of any individual or phenotype

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,119
and no natural selection that's

20
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,189
occurring meaning everyone is equally

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,979
fit for the environment there's no

22
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,509
advantage to be one or the other the

23
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,369
hardy-weinberg equation is true only if

24
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,710
these five things are met so as I said

25
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,959
here terms and conditions do apply large

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,280
population are animating no mutations

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,649
and no migrations and no natural

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,570
selection really does this exist in

29
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,359
nature but this does allow this equation

30
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,310
to hold true so hypothetically a non

31
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,618
evolving population preserves the allele

32
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,790
frequencies it serves as a model which

33
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,810
in this case we ran called a null

34
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,118
hypothesis what a null hypothesis is

35
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:20,430
this is referring to an area where if we

36
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,799
have a hypothesis we have a question

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,710
calculated mean for the sample if

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
there's a small difference we fail to

39
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:30,149
reject the hypothesis that be the null

40
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,340
hypothesis there if we do have enough

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,240
data to reject that hypothesis mean it

42
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,579
was wrong or we're proving it to not be

43
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,179
accurate in the case has to be a large

44
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:41,578
difference

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,430
this results in rejection of the

46
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,839
hypothesis so values that support the

47
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,570
null hypothesis occur in the green

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,299
region and dyes that do not support the

49
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:53,008
the values supporting the alternate

50
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,740
hypothesis so I occur in the red those

51
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,019
are the extremes there so natural

52
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,599
populations really are in hardy-weinberg

53
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:02,670
equilibrium however this is a useful

54
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,009
model to measure the forces acting on a

55
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,600
population the null hypothesis means

56
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,628
insignificant or no relationship between

57
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,799
two variables no difference is one way

58
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,799
to consider it here

59
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,019
so the hardwired Librium made by a

60
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:19,429
mathematician the last name party and

61
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,319
it's a physician the last name of

62
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,390
Weinberg came together and they were

63
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:25,009
considered with questions like what

64
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:26,718
happens to frequencies of alleles in the

65
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:28,188
population over time and would you

66
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:30,500
expect to see alleles disappear or

67
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:32,449
become more frequent over time they're

68
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,750
working with diploid Mendelian

69
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:37,518
population here so this population

70
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,039
genetics is the study of properties of

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,900
genes in a population genetic variation

72
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,150
in the population puzzled scientist and

73
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,000
this was one way that they seek to try

74
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,319
to explain it so looking at point out in

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,239
large populations with mating they're

76
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,458
mating allele frequencies remain

77
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,620
constant dominant alleles do not in fact

78
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,900
replace recessive ones as was once

79
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,730
thought so through the process of random

80
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,060
mating there's no advantage to any

81
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:03,530
phenotype or genotype here here we have

82
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,299
sort of mating which is showing that

83
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,938
there are in this case these bugs tend

84
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:10,340
to meet with ones of the same size this

85
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:12,560
non-random mating here would be the same

86
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,900
color would be mating together we're

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,209
talking about random mating where this

88
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,590
colour bug will mate with any other

89
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:22,729
color bugs at with an equal chance

90
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,650
so here's getting to a little bit of an

91
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:27,440
example here with a population of 100

92
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,859
Tigers to make it easy and it's 84

93
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:33,500
orange and 16 white so 84 out of 100 is

94
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,939
really easy it's 84 percent and 16 have

95
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,378
100 is 16 percent

96
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,750
however because we're going to work with

97
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:40,608
these in a math equation we do convert

98
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:45,158
those to decimals so we simply divide by

99
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:47,479
100 84% 0.8 for 16 percent is 0.16

100
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:49,068
remember population that is in

101
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,280
hardy-weinberg equilibrium is not

102
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:53,839
evolving so the frequency like there's

103
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,189
not a hundred if you take the number of

104
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,229
individuals and divide it by the total

105
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:59,150
number of individuals being considered

106
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:01,489
in this case it being 100 makes it very

107
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,079
easy but if this number was to differ

108
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,930
you take your individuals divided by the

109
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,239
total so let's get to an example to me

110
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,560
two alleles Big B little B the dominant

111
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,658
allele is going to be of course Big B

112
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,799
recessive allele is gonna be a little B

113
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:17,389
however in the hardy-weinberg equation

114
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,620
the dominance can be represented by this

115
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:23,930
letter P and recessive by Q so P plus Q

116
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,060
if we only had a and B must equal one or

117
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,949
a hundred percent and I have the

118
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,089
examples here

119
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,029
Tigers that we're going to work with

120
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:32,859
also a couple links to some information

121
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:35,799
about white tigers in another PowerPoint

122
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,420
if you're interested in looking so this

123
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,780
is the hardy-weinberg equation right

124
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,780
here P squared plus 2pq plus q squared

125
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:47,859
equals 1 what is all this reefer - well

126
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:49,989
homozygous dominant is P times P which

127
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,300
is where your P squared comes from this

128
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,980
is represented right here homozygous

129
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,620
recessive if we remember we changed our

130
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,850
little B's to Q's Q times Q which is Q

131
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,980
squared that's represented by this

132
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,640
individual the heterozygous to make it a

133
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:07,810
little confusing it's P times Q plus Q

134
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,699
times P which is simplified as - PQ and

135
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,879
it's all set to equal one trip sent one

136
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,649
hundred percent of the population so

137
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,810
let's look at this here's our equation

138
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,739
here

139
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,040
remember R will come and allele the

140
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,319
dominance be it doesn't invite the P

141
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,720
here which is gonna be here or

142
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,610
homozygous dominant are less common

143
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,000
allele or recessive one since the native

144
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:35,170
is Q and P plus Q must always equal 1 to

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,240
represent 100% a dominant allele B is

146
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,250
for the orange color and we excessively

147
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,560
it'll produce the white color so

148
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,930
individuals of homozygous for Big B and

149
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,629
represented here these are our

150
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,490
homozygous recessive for the allele and

151
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:53,019
this is our heterozygous or one big be

152
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,759
one little B so you're kind of relating

153
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,709
that hopefully this will make it a

154
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,500
little bit easier to understand with our

155
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:02,229
p representing our Big B and our Q

156
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,149
representing our little bit so we only

157
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,259
have a choice between two so that has to

158
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:07,569
equal one hundred percent of the

159
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:09,099
population and here we have our P

160
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,180
squared representing our Big B Big B

161
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,620
homozygous dominant Q squared equal

162
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,840
equalling or representing our homozygous

163
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,050
recessive two little bees and our

164
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:24,199
heterozygous as Big B little B in all

165
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:26,810
equal one so a population

166
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,969
Hunter Tigers 84 orange 16 white how

167
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,129
many of the genotype exist is the

168
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,590
question so let's go through let's

169
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:37,490
calculate that in this box here well

170
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:40,639
remember our recessive the 16 white we

171
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:44,569
know is going to be 16% and we know what

172
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,789
that genotype is we can't assume we have

173
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:47,959
a consistent amount for the dominant

174
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,750
because remember could be homozygous

175
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:56,419
diamond or heterozygous we want to start

176
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:59,540
with the homozygous recessive so 16%

177
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:03,170
represented by 0.16 that's BB or Q

178
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:06,050
squared to get to Q or just B we have to

179
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:10,220
take these 16 and square root it to get

180
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:14,060
0.4 now we know that 0.4 + X must equal

181
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,310
1 therefore a 1 - point forty point six

182
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:20,300
the dominant allele or the Big B

183
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,670
represent I P here would equal 0.6 so

184
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,350
what the genotype frequencies well we

185
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,210
have to remember that it we must assume

186
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,790
this population is in hardy-weinberg

187
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:31,789
equilibrium so we just calculated with

188
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:34,700
this information here the frequency of Q

189
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:38,420
and the frequency of P starting with the

190
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,439
recessive so to get to Big B Big E which

191
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,819
is P squared

192
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:50,660
we take our 0.6 and we square it to get

193
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:53,540
0.36 for our heterozygous - p qs - PQ so

194
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,490
here's our 2 PQ so two times 0.4 times

195
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,730
0.6 will give us the point four eight

196
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:02,150
and the last one here our Q squared

197
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:05,330
we take our Q in this case which is our

198
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:08,439
0.4 and we square it to get 0.16 all

199
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:10,699
these added together should equal one so

200
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,339
this gives you a little bit more of the

201
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,050
background of the math here remember Q

202
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:18,229
is the point 1 6 square root it gives

203
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,990
you the point 4 v + Q it goes 1

204
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,879
therefore P equals 1 minus Q which

205
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,889
equals 1 nine point four two point six

206
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,569
it might get a little confusing here

207
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:29,509
you're welcome to pause this at any time

208
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:31,879
and look back P squared is our 0.6

209
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,919
squared to give us point three six which

210
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,850
means 36 out of a hundred Tigers will be

211
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,860
homozygous dominant we have the

212
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,139
heterozygous here which is the point six

213
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,940
times the point four times two to give

214
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:45,500
us the point four eight which means 48

215
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,850
out of the hundred Tigers will be orange

216
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,289
and heterozygous so again take your time

217
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,230
go back flip through this and take a

218
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:54,769
look at it

219
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,620
assuming kind of hardy-weinberg

220
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:59,149
equilibrium here's the what we just

221
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,399
calculated this would be considered the

222
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:04,129
null hypothesis but now we take a look

223
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,470
in we take some sample data we take some

224
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:08,990
genetic screens of our Tigers and we

225
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,840
come up with these numbers so how do we

226
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,879
explain this data well clearly this the

227
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,920
recessive ones match but there is a

228
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,950
strong favoritism for whatever reason

229
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,509
for the homozygous dominant genes so

230
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,840
this may give these individuals a

231
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:27,139
particular advantage versus the

232
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,970
heterozygote and still orange if we take

233
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:31,309
another population take a sample we see

234
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,870
here how to explain this data will clear

235
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:34,459
the heterozygotes now has a clear

236
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,769
advantage because they're being selected

237
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,420
for there's no phenotype difference but

238
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:42,199
this could be an advantage Geno

239
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:44,269
typically all right let's a little bit

240
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,950
more data okay and always welcome to

241
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:49,669
pause the video and take a look at it

242
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,740
this takes a look at Leo frequencies I'm

243
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:55,279
looking at and a number of individuals

244
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,740
at 200 instead of just 100 here again

245
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,360
starting with the homozygous recessive

246
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,669
because we know what that is you can go

247
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,399
through and calculate that in this case

248
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:07,159
the alleles contribute to a gene pool of

249
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:10,250
200 remember our genes are 200 but our

250
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:13,159
total individuals are 100 genes because

251
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,830
they're diploid are multiplied by 2 in

252
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,559
this case and the possible gametes you

253
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,770
could see again follow this through if

254
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,419
you go back and watch the previous steps

255
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:25,610
that I went through this follows the

256
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:27,319
same exact thing and it's important to

257
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,360
follow the math I'll also have another

258
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,800
video going through another example to

259
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,180
help provide you with some experience I

260
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,729
know initially this is a little

261
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:37,129
confusing I'm watching this again doing

262
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,320
some examples as we will do in class can

263
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:41,689
definitely get you by that initial

264
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,230
hurdle and I think once you understand

265
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,820
it it'll come easier to you again it

266
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,440
shows the same example little graphical

267
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,660
representation adding in the punnett

268
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,350
square so you can kind of see where the

269
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:53,089
P

270
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,519
squared comes from with the homozygous

271
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,139
dominant the q squared which is the

272
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,210
homozygous recessive and then the

273
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,490
heterozygotes here and how these alleles

274
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,150
break apart and how they come up with

275
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,740
the numbers that are calculated here

276
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,169
last slide just to go over in this

277
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,930
presentation we're looking another

278
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:14,179
another example here again tying in the

279
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:17,029
punnett squares following the same

280
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:20,569
equation of the P squared plus 2pq plus

281
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:22,819
q squared equal one and using now a

282
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,240
different number of individuals so you

283
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,980
can see how we calculate the totals here

284
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,860
individuals here is 500 we need to

285
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,920
convert our number of individuals versus

286
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,620
our total based on the 500 to get to our

287
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,990
P's in our Q's and remember P plus Q

288
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,700
equals 1 so by using genotype

289
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,950
frequencies along with the known number

290
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,870
of individuals of allele frequencies can

291
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,780
be calculated and using the allele

292
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,000
frequencies here predicted frequencies

293
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:52,850
as homozygous dominant and recessive and

294
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,190
heterozygotes can be calculated well we

295
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,409
want to start with the recessive because

296
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,820
we know what those are if we start with

297
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,719
the phenotype here we don't know if

298
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,300
we're dealing with the homozygous

299
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,070
dominant or the heterozygotes but once

300
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:06,559
we have the recessive we know P plus Q

301
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:10,220
equals one and from there we can start

302
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:12,619
to solve our equation and calculate the

303
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,019
dominant phenotypes what the exact unit

304
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,639
types are for those so again you can

305
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:18,289
watch this video again if not I have

306
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,090
another example video you're welcome to

307
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:21,500
check out to hopefully get you through

308
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:24,009
and understanding the hardy-weinberg

309
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,009
equation
