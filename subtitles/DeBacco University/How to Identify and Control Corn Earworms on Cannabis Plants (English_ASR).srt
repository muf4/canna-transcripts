1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,439
not sure if you've seen this insect in

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,799
your cannabis plants but

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,199
corn earworms can be a major pest

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,400
so in this debaco university video i'm

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,239
going to go over how to properly

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,920
identify and control them

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,920
in your cannabis plants

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,518
[Music]

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,118
all right let's go over how to identify

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,719
and control corn earworms

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:27,920
in cannabis plants and this is kind of

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,799
what they look like hopefully you

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,039
haven't seen them

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,160
but if you have this video should

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,880
provide you with some helpful

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,519
information so first off the description

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,440
of them

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
well corn earrings is one of the most

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,399
widespread common

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,640
commonly damaging insects in much of the

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,399
united states affecting both field crops

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,039
as well as vegetable crops

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,960
all in addition to hemp most damage is

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,120
done by the late stage caterpillars

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,239
which are present 10 to 14 days after

26
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,479
egg hatching

27
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,759
and feed for a week or two before being

28
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,599
fully grown

29
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,759
so kind of at this stage often there

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
will be a granular form of fecal kind of

31
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,198
like pellets or frass

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,600
left around the feeding site that can be

33
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,000
used for diagnosing an injury

34
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,759
this is also what the adult corn earworm

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,118
may look like there

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,799
and this is kind of what the larval

37
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:16,000
stage looks and that's what the egg

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,200
looks like now the proper identification

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,719
of at least looking

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
on cannabis the adult moths fly at dusk

41
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,438
and evening

42
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,879
although a few are sometimes active on

43
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,599
overcast days

44
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,759
on other plants the moths lay most of

45
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,559
their eggs on the leaves or in corn the

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,680
green kind of

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,680
silk area so i get the name earworm on

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
hemp though eggs are likely laid on the

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
outer areas of the plant particularly on

50
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,239
the younger leaves

51
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,239
such as those surrounding the flower

52
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,920
buds and developing seeds that's why we

53
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,559
see the kind of caterpillar up here

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,239
feeding

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,759
and here we also see the damage to the

56
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,319
blood region

57
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,599
as far as what can we do regarding this

58
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,758
particular pest

59
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,798
well for the management of corn earworms

60
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,319
entrust

61
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
was the only product that provided

62
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,000
really effective control

63
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,679
unfortunately this is the one product

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,478
that was evaluated by uh

65
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
this is vermont and is not allowed to be

66
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:06,718
applied unhemped so it's the one that

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,639
they really looked at

68
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,079
does show some effectiveness as we can

69
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,079
see clearly here

70
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,599
but not certified so hopefully that was

71
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,360
the time this publication

72
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,039
maybe things have changed check your

73
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,239
local restrictions and current

74
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,000
restrictions at that

75
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,080
the insecticide and trust is army

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,759
certified however so that's a plus and

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
here we could see the mean coin rooms

78
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,799
per

79
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,800
um 10 plants and trust definitely doing

80
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,040
a great job at reducing it

81
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,480
according damage rating also was reduced

82
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,679
by interest so that is definitely

83
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,079
something to look at

84
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,080
to see if it's available to use in your

85
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,239
particular area or regulations

86
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,519
because it might be a first step at an

87
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,759
effective control

88
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,319
for corn earworms on your cannabis

89
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,318
plants
