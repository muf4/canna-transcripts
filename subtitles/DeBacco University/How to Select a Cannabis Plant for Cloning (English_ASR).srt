1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
all right in this tobacco university

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,758
video i'm going to go over how to select

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,918
cannabis plant for cloning

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,120
and while individual growers or breeding

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,678
styles may differ

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,039
let me give you some general ideas or

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,880
points to consider

8
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,160
when you're going about selecting a

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,109
cannabis plant for

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:24,960
cloning

11
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:26,559
[Music]

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,000
all right let's get into this tobacco

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,599
university video

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,518
well first off what should you be

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,719
looking for and different growers may

16
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:33,679
have different targets

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,840
but you want to be considering the

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,000
morphology how the plant actually looks

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,960
the timing some of the genetics that

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,960
that plant may have

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,160
and also the chemical profiles that it

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,239
might be producing

23
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,599
so i'll talk about each these in brief

24
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,199
detail here

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
so first off the morphology remember

26
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,000
this is referring to the plant structure

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,360
be aware that this does not always hold

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,039
true this can be impacted by the

29
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,719
environment the plants are growing in

30
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,640
if a plant gets more fertilizer than

31
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
another this could impact its morphology

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,439
it could cause it to stretch more

33
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,520
because it had to be more compact so

34
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,719
just again keep that in mind this is why

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,920
documentation

36
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,000
of how you grow in your growing

37
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,519
procedure is very important

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,239
if you're only growing a few plants this

39
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,158
may make the selection process harder to

40
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,640
find that true standout that might have

41
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,680
a very

42
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,519
unique morphology is it very spacey

43
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,520
is it more of a normal or is it very

44
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,560
compact just things to consider there

45
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,158
when we're looking at a plants of

46
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,680
morphology

47
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,200
the timing so when we're talking about

48
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,200
timing we can talk about the speed it

49
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,478
takes for it to produce flowers

50
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,478
some growers look for plants that

51
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,319
produce pre-flowers quicker looking for

52
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,679
that quicker turnaround time

53
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,599
however this needs to be balanced out

54
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,360
with the size of the overall plant

55
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,519
just because the plant grows very

56
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,920
quickly and produces flowers it might be

57
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,359
shorter or stunted might not produce as

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
much overall so that needs to be

59
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,840
considered

60
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,758
because if the plant's too small again

61
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
those overall years the total biomass

62
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,680
might be reduced might make it great for

63
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
maybe a small tent setup but maybe not

64
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,040
for large scale production

65
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,559
but also if the plant takes a long time

66
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,759
to flower this can reduce the chance of

67
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,359
turning over more

68
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,200
growth cycles in a year if you're

69
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,879
growing indoors so you have that

70
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
consideration to make do you kind of

71
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,199
have more growth cycles and turn over

72
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,199
faster

73
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,360
when you grow a little bit longer and

74
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,039
get more yield per grow cycle so again

75
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,560
there's that balance there

76
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,120
and things to consider when you look at

77
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,560
the speed it takes that plant to flower

78
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,280
then also the genetics so if you get a

79
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,280
genetic

80
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,439
test you have a plant that may be an

81
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,878
isolate this can be used for cloning to

82
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,039
allow further proliferation

83
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,639
of those certain genetics potentially

84
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,560
also getting into the breeding and

85
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,359
crossing of those genetics into other

86
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,719
lineages well then there's multiple

87
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,760
individuals that may be possible to

88
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,120
produce pollen

89
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,280
from the female plant allowing for

90
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,159
feminized seed production method to also

91
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
be employed

92
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,199
in this channel is more information on

93
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,640
that if you want to look at exactly how

94
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,039
to produce feminized seed

95
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,878
but this is just another consideration

96
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,318
to make when you're considering you know

97
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,639
what plants to go through and clone look

98
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,719
at the genetics maybe get a profile test

99
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,559
that can be advantageous

100
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,158
then we talk about the chemical profiles

101
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
just in general so we'll look at the

102
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,280
chemical profiles

103
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
similar to the genetic profile but these

104
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,000
can also be influenced by environmental

105
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,120
factors so be

106
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,959
mindful that take this into

107
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,400
consideration just because you test a

108
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,158
plant one time for terpenes

109
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,680
you might get slightly different numbers

110
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,120
if you test it again if you change your

111
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,879
fertilizer regimen

112
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,560
however if there's a uniquely desirable

113
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:19,679
chemical profiles such as cannabinoids

114
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,759
and or terpenes

115
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,120
even if the plant's morphology is poor

116
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,639
it may be worth cloning

117
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,560
to incorporate that into a breeding

118
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,079
program you get one genetic set to

119
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,519
isolate the profiles

120
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,040
and then breed that into a better plant

121
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,959
that's better morphology you're trying

122
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,158
to get the best of both worlds

123
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,479
the goal will be to multiply plants from

124
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,239
known quality chemical profiles and then

125
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,518
breed them with other plants in hopes of

126
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,360
altering the morphology

127
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,039
while still maintaining the chemical

128
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,799
profile so again this is what that

129
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,679
breathing process does take time

130
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,040
don't think you're just going to go

131
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
through breed it once and you know get

132
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,679
the end result

133
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,959
this is going to take some trial and

134
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,439
error even on a large scale

135
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
the plant's age can impact the rooting

136
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,079
so younger plants typically have

137
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,319
improved rooting over those

138
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
older plants so when given the option

139
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,759
you want to select the most youthful

140
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,280
plant material to age in maximizing the

141
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,120
potential success

142
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
of your cuttings it doesn't mean that

143
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,158
the older plants cannot root

144
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,079
but you're looking at having that you

145
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,238
know maximum rooting that

146
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,439
quickest best turnaround time the

147
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,039
younger the plant the

148
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,759
increased odds that you have of

149
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,360
producing a vigorous root system

150
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,600
and then in the end really what it comes

151
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
down to is growers choice

152
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,360
when it comes to selecting a plant for

153
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,639
cloning it comes down to what the grower

154
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,560
determines to be desirable it can be a

155
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,400
delicate and time-consuming process

156
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,399
so in short the grower needs to justify

157
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,758
this investment with hopes of producing

158
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,359
the quality end product

159
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,280
see the person here we see the flag at

160
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
the far end just take a left to right to

161
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,839
breathe this way or that way there might

162
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,679
be two different ways to get the end

163
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,399
goal but ultimately it's that grower's

164
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
decision

165
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,359
here's an example of a whole bunch of

166
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,879
plants and for this grower they

167
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,560
determined this one was desirable and

168
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,040
chopped all the other ones down

169
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,560
so this is why it's mindful or wise for

170
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,840
growers to go through and have an idea

171
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,918
what they're breeding for

172
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,119
have an idea what they're looking and to

173
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,758
constantly make those

174
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,680
selections based on that same plan so

175
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,759
you're as efficient as you can

176
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,079
with the entire process because even

177
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,560
being efficient it will still take time

178
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,918
to get that high end quality and result

179
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,720
that's kind of part of the fun and

180
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,719
interest

181
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,639
with the cloning process and the genetic

182
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,000
isolates when we're talking about canvas

183
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
or other plants in general
