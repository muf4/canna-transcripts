1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,009
this video is on the alternation of

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,469
generations and plants commonly this

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,109
topic can trip students up so again

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:12,210
every reminds you to this link below in

5
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:13,500
the description is for the slides and

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,929
you're welcome to pause this video and

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,539
watch multiple times until you fully

8
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,519
understand the concept the opening image

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,868
here is a very simplified version and I

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,789
have several others throughout the

11
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:25,920
presentation if you part we want to look

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,529
at the gametophyte phase in the

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,420
sporophyte phase so sporophyte and

14
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,880
gametophyte might we think me to fight

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,340
think producing gametes and the

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,530
sporophyte is producing spores that will

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,530
help you just with the initial potential

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,239
for confusion so what's the basics of

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,308
this process well the situation is quite

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,378
different from that in animals where in

21
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:49,409
animals the fundamental process is that

22
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:52,769
a diploid remember to an individual

23
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:55,769
directly produces haploid or n gametes

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,329
by meiosis we see that pictured here so

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,760
if a multicellular organism two men

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,679
directly producing unicellular gametes

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,920
at one end and those fuse together to

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,450
form again the multicellular 2n organism

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,570
however now in plants this alternation

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,299
of generations in the life cycle this

31
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:15,389
thus between a diploid again to end

32
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,909
generation of sporophytes and a haploid

33
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,590
and generation of gametophyte so how

34
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,900
does this differ we still have our

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,939
multicellular sporophyte here but we

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,759
have a multicellular gametophyte here

37
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:29,459
unlike the unicellular in animals how do

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,859
we get there well there's a two N's four

39
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,658
and then there are one and gametes that

40
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,250
are forming this cycle so this

41
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,159
alternation of generations we see

42
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,609
there's a couple more steps involved in

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,229
plants versus animals so it's important

44
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:46,709
to keep track of this let's go through

45
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:49,379
some examples so this shows you more

46
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,459
familiar with in humans here sperm and

47
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,828
egg coming together through

48
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,780
fertilization to form the embryo that's

49
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:56,759
producing the individual that's then

50
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,820
producing the adult and pastas is

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,159
repeating however here meiosis is

52
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,258
producing male and female spores but

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,070
there's a male gametophyte and there's a

54
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,409
female gametophyte

55
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:11,280
these can be multicellular haploid cells

56
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:12,810
then through the process of

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,800
fertilization that produces the embryo

58
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,900
that's producing the end

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,420
that prisons the adult so there's an

60
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,010
extra little step involved compared to

61
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,799
that of animals or in this example

62
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:25,739
humans here's that same image from the

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,570
beginning in early pants plants meiosis

64
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,460
was delayed in the cells of the zygote

65
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:32,129
divided to produce a multicellular

66
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,740
diploid structure this resulted in an

67
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,199
alternation of generations in which a

68
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,870
diploid generation alternates with a

69
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,329
haploid one so a diploid generation is

70
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,240
called a sporophyte they're going to be

71
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,590
producing the spores and the haploid

72
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,230
generation is called the camino fight

73
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,219
that's me - sneaky means let me see that

74
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:54,899
pictured here here's our gametophyte s--

75
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:57,419
producing our gametes which are fusing

76
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,920
together to form our zygote which is

77
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,289
going through the process of mitosis to

78
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,389
form the sporophyte sporophyte goes

79
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:06,719
through meiosis to produce its spores

80
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:08,549
the spores entity become a multicellular

81
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,830
communicate that in turn produce gametes

82
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,750
and so on and so forth this upper region

83
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,170
here is all haploid this will all return

84
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,509
all diploid so let's put this into a

85
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,619
little bit of a picture here so the

86
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,139
diploid generation is called the

87
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,659
sporophyte remember the 2n it's located

88
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:28,339
up here then this is a moss how Pledge n

89
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:31,799
is the gametophyte and that is the

90
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,979
example here so we see the gametophyte

91
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,719
being haploid and it would be example

92
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,539
down here and the sporophyte here would

93
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,609
be the diploid now these can look very

94
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:44,039
different ferns to a very stark example

95
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,510
here alternation of generations in ferns

96
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,889
each can look very different the

97
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:49,259
sporophytes what we might be familiar

98
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,479
with with the fronds and leaves but the

99
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,120
gametophyte actually looks like this and

100
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,689
again that's the result of the union of

101
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,890
spores fusing together to form mitosis

102
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:00,449
and this

103
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,719
gametophyte is going to produce the male

104
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:06,659
female gametes that will fertilize to

105
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,729
provide the developing sporophyte which

106
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,659
will grow into what to know it as our

107
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:14,159
firms unique to ferns

108
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:15,989
those form the yellowish brownish mass

109
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,939
at the edge or underside of the front

110
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,459
we've ever seen the fern may have

111
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,259
noticed these structures the shape and

112
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,840
arrangement and location of these what's

113
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,610
called sori are often valuable to use in

114
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,629
identifying a fern so they're very

115
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,629
unique to do

116
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:32,730
it's burn species in the Sawyer that

117
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:33,990
sport producing structure if you ever

118
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,710
seen a furnace call these little dots

119
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,840
under it those are the Sorai

120
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:41,310
so again this is a great image here I'm

121
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,129
gonna repeat and go through some of the

122
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,769
steps so here a diploid zygote two

123
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:49,920
single-cell haploid gametes each

124
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:52,889
containing an unpaired chromosomes fused

125
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,920
to form a single-celled diploid zygote

126
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:58,259
through the process of fertilization

127
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,660
this is I go now contains n pairs of

128
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,110
chromosomes which is 2n chromosomes in

129
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,150
total

130
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,310
notice the line yes is everything it's

131
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:09,779
going to be in the 2n this is our first

132
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,790
phase of 5 moving along here getting to

133
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,039
our sporophyte this single-celled

134
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,470
diploid zygote germinates dividing by

135
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,090
the normal process of mitosis which

136
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,280
maintains the number of chromosomes at

137
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:22,979
two ends obviously the two men here this

138
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,009
results in a multicellular diploid

139
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,470
organism this is called the sporophyte

140
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:31,439
because at maturity produces spores and

141
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,190
working our way clockwise around here in

142
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,199
the sporangia

143
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:37,560
when it reaches maturity the sporophyte

144
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,420
produces one more sporangia which are

145
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,870
the organs that produce the diploid

146
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,580
sperm mother cells or sports sites these

147
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,189
divided by a special process called

148
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,839
meiosis that reduces the number of

149
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:51,689
chromosomes by half remember crossing

150
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,669
this line here the initial results in

151
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:55,709
four single-celled haploid spores each

152
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:59,490
containing n pairs of chromosomes and

153
00:05:55,709 --> 00:06:02,339
you see here four cells as for spores

154
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,949
here each being cowboyed so we started

155
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:09,079
with 2n now we're going to each one of

156
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:11,360
these being and and four of them you

157
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,889
moving along with myself by the way

158
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,240
single-celled haploid sport terminates

159
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:17,759
dividing by the normal process of

160
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,280
mitosis which maintains the number of

161
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,069
chromosomes at n so we're maintaining in

162
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,589
this box this even though mitosis is

163
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,990
occurring and these cells are dividing

164
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:30,359
they're still haploid so there's still

165
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,579
haploid cells here everything on this

166
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,439
side of the line is haploid remember the

167
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,149
result is a multicellular haploid

168
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,029
organism called a gametophyte

169
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:41,489
and that's the key part here it's

170
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:43,500
multicellular haploid organism

171
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,240
it's even a fight signe the fight

172
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,629
because it produces the gametes so kind

173
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,370
of an easy way to remember that

174
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:51,689
progressing here they'll last up when it

175
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,250
reaches maturity the commuter fight

176
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:57,300
produces one or more community tangia

177
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,269
which are the organs that produce

178
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,310
haploid gametes at least one kind of gme

179
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:02,969
poses some mechanism for reaching the

180
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,280
other gammy

181
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,920
in order to use with it so is it the

182
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,989
example here of the sperm in the egg i

183
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,550
highlight it in the box here when these

184
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,189
come together that's the process of

185
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,259
fertilization that's going to take an N

186
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:18,269
in an end form a 2n which is a diploid

187
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,240
zygote and the process will repeat

188
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:23,219
itself so I know initially this can be a

189
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,240
little confusing you may want to review

190
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,820
this I've found an excellent study guide

191
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,560
resource here provided the links here so

192
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,750
again it's in the description you can

193
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,519
click on the slides and directly click

194
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,680
on these links to be able to give you

195
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,779
some information here I think will be

196
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,550
helpful in describing this process and I

197
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,469
tried to go through it in an organized

198
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,150
fashion as I said you may have to

199
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,160
rewatch this or pause it at certain

200
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:48,569
times but hopefully this is helpful in

201
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,050
explaining what is a pretty complex

202
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,050
topic
