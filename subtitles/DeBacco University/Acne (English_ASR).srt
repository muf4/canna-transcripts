1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,870
so this video lecture series is going to

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,719
talk about something you may have

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,660
experience with and that's acne bit over

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,449
I do is some of the science and give you

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,948
some of that background on what causes

6
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:18,149
this skin irritation that's very common

7
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:19,739
so first off I want to provide you with

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:21,959
some resources for some more information

9
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,059
I've pulled some of my information

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,830
directly from here and going to kind of

11
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:28,259
cover it briefly and you're welcome to

12
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,820
check out the scientists for more

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,189
information that provided with the links

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,659
to their PowerPoint slides first off

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,210
remember that acne is one of the most

16
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,819
common skin diseases with about 17

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,980
million Americans affected according to

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,558
the data and newest research close to

19
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:47,369
100% of people between the ages of 12

20
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:49,199
and 17 have acne in genetics do play a

21
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,929
role but they're not the sole or

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,359
potentially only cause of this

23
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:57,509
so people were surveyed about 503 here

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,859
and nearly 50% of respondents to the

25
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:02,159
question what do you think causes acne

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,719
said clements of skin many people

27
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,868
believe if they keep clean skin they

28
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,780
won't get acne and sadly this is not the

29
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:12,959
cases and does not hold true and when I

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,750
talk about why that is so what does

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,839
cause that was a true cause laugh is

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,459
caused by the plugging of alcohols which

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,070
is mostly due to excessive sebum

34
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:26,908
production by sebaceous glands steam

35
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:28,919
made by the influence of androgens which

36
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,290
are male sex hormones testosterone being

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,840
an example I have the oil well here we

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,670
have the excessive oil production that

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,728
skin characterization a plugin of these

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,950
follicles speed up the formation of acne

41
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:43,408
normal skin bacteria produces irritating

42
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,478
seven-second causing inflammation that's

43
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,479
also external influences such as

44
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:51,478
friction and also medications can also

45
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:55,049
be causes of acne caused that to be

46
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,789
worse in some individuals the kind of

47
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,590
quick summary of what acne actually is

48
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,920
it's the plugin of the follicle to begin

49
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,159
with

50
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,659
there's also excessive sebum production

51
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:08,789
in the presence in activity of the

52
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:11,489
bacterium pro piane bacterium acnes is

53
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,109
the actual bacterium named ultimately

54
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,830
this will lead to inflammation and that

55
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,210
causes the

56
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,770
redness 2bc looking at diet stress and

57
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,219
acne wasn't controversial link between

58
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,990
diet and acne you know does it cause it

59
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,030
as it influence it although many

60
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,610
patients believe that their acne is

61
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,490
influenced by certain foods Western diet

62
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,780
may be associated with acne there's kind

63
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,060
of that glycemic index

64
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,460
I can potentially be linked to acne but

65
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,490
it's not necessarily as much of our

66
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,430
presence as we may think skim milk may

67
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,620
have some of these in cryogenic hormones

68
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,170
and it could be associated with acne in

69
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,759
teenage girls in particular stress

70
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,399
acting among the university students was

71
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,280
associated with exam stress so there is

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,140
a chance that some instances there can

73
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,090
be these factors that may influence it

74
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:05,369
but it's not I say the main cause of

75
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:07,740
acne our androgens in acne the male

76
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,599
hormones remember these some of these

77
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,510
male hormones while entitled male

78
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,719
hormones example testosterone are found

79
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:17,219
in both males and females the reason why

80
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,099
they're called male hormones is they're

81
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,870
found in higher concentrations in males

82
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,370
and these can cause the oil glands of

83
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,469
the skin to produce more sebum which is

84
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,989
more oil and I think that excessive

85
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:30,629
sebum production can lead to that

86
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:32,879
increased evidence of acne now there's

87
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,319
two main forms here that can occur to

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,750
make conditions that can result in acne

89
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,819
one can be a high hormone level this

90
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,519
increased amount of hormone can lead to

91
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,919
overproduction of sebum - see here hi

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,050
hormone level excessive oil production

93
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,268
there's also another condition could be

94
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,400
high receptor level the ischemic cells

95
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,560
overly sensitive to the signal resulting

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,900
in high production of sebum so there's a

97
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,550
lot of receptors even there's kind of a

98
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,170
lower amounts of the hormone present

99
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,969
there'll be a lot of binding sites and

100
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:02,518
that can lead to a lot of oil being

101
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:05,849
produced resulting in greater incidence

102
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:09,209
of acne now cause of excessive sebum

103
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:11,489
production and increase of our inter Jin

104
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,959
here hormonal secretions become higher

105
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,659
during puberty which causes these

106
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,910
sebaceous glands to become larger and

107
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:21,029
simply produce more sebum remember it's

108
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,550
that ki sebum production that is causing

109
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:26,759
the main cause of that acne that does

110
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,480
occur in both males and females women I

111
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,550
can have them

112
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,530
Oh cycle being prior being pregnant

113
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,660
starting our ending can take

114
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:35,969
contraceptive pills which can cause

115
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,730
hormonal changes we can influence them

116
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,660
even further so as I said medication can

117
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:44,490
cause that certain hormone level changes

118
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,120
can also influence the semen production

119
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:50,090
which then will result in acne heredity

120
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,699
and against that drugs can also

121
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:55,859
potentially influence this look at the

122
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,529
variations of acne a very light

123
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,770
condition here little characters by our

124
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:03,479
whiteheads blackheads example very hard

125
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,579
to see moderate which is inflammatory

126
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,370
increases and becomes more serious and

127
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:11,219
of course the severe case see here can

128
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:15,000
also result in scarring in the most

129
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,770
severe cases look at some facts and

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,379
causes about acne most people think if

131
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:21,240
they eat chocolate and greasy foods for

132
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,670
example the nice droplet bar or the

133
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,050
french fries will that cause it got me

134
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,460
to occur well there's no scientific

135
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,500
proof there's a correlation between that

136
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,019
well dirty skin cause acne

137
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,279
well actives caused by acceptors

138
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:34,849
production of sebum from the skin that

139
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:37,199
necessary dirt can stress caused

140
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,129
increase after you getting it ready for

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,439
an exam or

142
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:43,290
big tests there is potentially some

143
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,180
relationship there however recent

144
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,530
studies do show these corticosteroids

145
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,540
which are increased during times of

146
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:51,779
stress may stimulate sebum production

147
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:55,250
and hence worsen acne so it may not be a

148
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:58,469
director always a direct cause but these

149
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,839
corticosteroids if they increase that

150
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:04,140
sebum production that is what then will

151
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,419
result in acne facts about treatment of

152
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,250
acne why do I get asked me

153
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,170
despite washing my face several times a

154
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,209
day well too much washing can actually

155
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,250
irritate the skin further and worsen

156
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:16,949
your acne so James Lee watching her face

157
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,230
daily with a mild cleanser or soap and

158
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,789
patting it dry can help reduce acne but

159
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,370
excessive washing is actually a bad

160
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,050
thing so we believe this let acne run

161
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,519
its course would be fine well if you

162
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,410
have those severe cases it could cause

163
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,639
scarring

164
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,110
should I squeeze the acne should I kind

165
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,149
of kind of get rid of it that way

166
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,770
well squeezing can actually cause that

167
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:38,099
in fact i'ma try to go deeper into your

168
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:39,569
skin and if acne cannot be cured in a

169
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,830
month then should I try other drugs or

170
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,599
treatments well

171
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:44,459
these are very slow acting which is

172
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,140
again that what people want to hear but

173
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,810
you typically have to wait over a month

174
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,189
to see if there's actual effects because

175
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,040
you try something next week or the week

176
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:56,629
after didn't work it may take longer for

177
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,650
that to actually activate me see results

178
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:00,629
lastly the purpose of these acne

179
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:01,889
treatments to decrease the sebum

180
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,949
production that's the key part here

181
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,689
where we reduce the bacterium reduce

182
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:09,060
securitisation and eliminate

183
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:10,529
inflammation dermatologists would be the

184
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,879
best they can combine two or more

185
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,369
treatments to create an effective

186
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,709
therapy to prevent new lesions from

187
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,959
forming so one of the one plus one

188
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:22,049
equals kind of three here well in

189
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,639
certain cases you can try to separate

190
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,860
treatments you could get a very positive

191
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,199
effect more than just each one

192
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,730
individually so this kind of just

193
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,579
relates to the purpose of acne

194
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,590
treatments each individual is unique and

195
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:37,019
dermatologists can have more tools at

196
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:40,289
their disposal have seen more cases and

197
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:42,870
as a result can suggest the best mode of

198
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,850
treatment for you in your individual

199
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,980
case where if they prescribe something

200
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,450
too may have to wait over a month for it

201
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,670
to work which may not be what you want

202
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,729
to hear but hopefully the goal is that

203
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:56,069
long term the reduction in serum

204
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,400
production to ultimately reduce your

205
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,399
acne
