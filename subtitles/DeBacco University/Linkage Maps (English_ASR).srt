1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,870
here we're gonna look at linkage maps in

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,419
relation to genes located on the same

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,929
chromosome let's go through an example

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:14,849
here so first off this should make basic

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,868
sense looking at a linkage map it

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,640
estimates the distance between genes

7
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:23,879
more closely linked genes would be

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,730
closer together and less closely linked

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,948
genes will be further apart so we're

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,189
looking at a linkage map to try to

11
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,439
determine the location of certain genes

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,039
in relation to whether one another and

13
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:40,049
how close how far they may be so as an

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,299
example how can linkage maps be made

15
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:45,390
from observations of traits well our

16
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:48,000
recombination frequencies the inserted

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,020
gene terms given gene X Gen Y and gene z

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,570
gene X and Gen Y we kind of a about 8%

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:59,129
of time meaning about eight units away

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,579
from one another X and Z though are 12%

21
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:06,329
so here's our X we're wondering at 12%

22
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:10,799
whether the Z is 12 units away to the

23
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:14,340
left or from x 12 units away to the

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,060
right so this is a kind of a quandary

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,400
here looking at we know it's 12%

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,879
becoming frequency so it's 12 base pairs

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,359
away or 12 units away I should say so

28
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,969
we're not sure though if it's gonna go

29
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:33,180
basically 12 units this way or 12 units

30
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,798
the other way so we need some more

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,799
information

32
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:41,700
knowing that Y in Z are four percent so

33
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,200
Z is four units away from Y we then can

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,899
make the conclusion that Z's over in

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,850
this way so see initially here without

36
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,549
this information we know here we're

37
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:51,809
exits we know Z is 12 units away we

38
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,970
don't know if it's the left or right now

39
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,350
but by getting that information that is

40
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,798
also four units away from Y 8 plus 4 is

41
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:00,599
12

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,060
and there's our X there's our Y and

43
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,890
that's where her Z would be located with

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,670
this information we're able to eliminate

45
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,789
the possibility that Z is located

46
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,259
let's look another example so crossover

47
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,799
frequencies can be converted to again

48
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,549
these map

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,760
yeah so take for example a 5% crossover

50
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:25,560
frequency equals 5 map units since easy

51
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:27,299
enough gene a and gene B cross over 6

52
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,939
percent of the time so how many map

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:35,820
units would that be 6 map units gene B

54
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:38,120
and gene C cross over 12 and a half

55
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:43,289
percent of time we can convert that to

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,759
12.5 map units gene a and gene states of

57
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:47,250
taking the information from here here

58
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,979
crossover eighteen and a half percent of

59
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,259
the time so again this being six map

60
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:56,340
units away this being twelve and a half

61
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:57,929
map units away six plus twelve and a

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,319
half would give us detune half

63
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,629
indicating a to B and then C is located

64
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,870
over here you could see because this

65
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:11,090
follows everything here aim B 6 units

66
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:14,280
away yep B and C are 12 units away

67
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:17,129
indicating that a to C is 18 and a half

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,569
that makes it simply though ABC won't be

69
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,180
all it will always be the case but

70
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:23,280
hopefully you can kind of follow and

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,159
understand how we got to the order and

72
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,390
the distance between these two see once

73
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,549
you Hale it's actually it's pretty easy

74
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:34,259
to go over so let's check HERE based on

75
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,209
the above linkage map one located here

76
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:39,449
what's the frequency of gene a and gene

77
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:43,050
be crossing over together Virge engaging

78
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,729
in G and C could also draw on leakage

79
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,590
map based on the fine crossover

80
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:49,919
percentages for the three gene pairs a

81
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,330
if a.m. these 8% B and C is 10 percent

82
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,169
and C is 2 percent what would that

83
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:56,340
physically look like so then get the

84
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,619
first one here based on the above

85
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,229
linkage map or if you go here can pause

86
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,490
it I'm gonna give you the answers so for

87
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,869
the first one here based on the above

88
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,120
linkage map since case to be the below

89
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:11,509
linkage map what are the frequencies of

90
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:16,259
a and B crossing over here's a here's B

91
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:20,339
40% minus 25% but gives you the distance

92
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:22,079
here that would be 15% and then D to C

93
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,469
so here's D and C we want to figure out

94
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,479
what this distance is we take a and D we

95
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,860
subtract a 2 C 20

96
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,750
percent minus 30% this distance is 5%

97
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,759
please realize that this map may not be

98
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,470
drawn to scale by simply calculating

99
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,279
these figures out you can tell this

100
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:45,360
distance based on the math is 5% and the

101
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:48,869
distance between B and a or a and B here

102
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,879
would be 15% the other part of that

103
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,329
question trial linkage math base and the

104
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:57,029
slide crossover percentages if Amy's 8%

105
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:59,189
and B and C is 10% a and C its 2% and

106
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:02,039
what order these are in so I start we're

107
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:05,730
just drawing simple two ends I connect

108
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,990
them together and I start to label and

109
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,129
you go with the first information you've

110
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:15,509
got here and a 2 B would be 8% so it's

111
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:20,129
just a longer distance here B 2 C would

112
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:22,379
be 10% so B and C is 10% and C is 2%

113
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:25,620
we know that that C is located here not

114
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:29,639
over here because 8 plus 2 is that 10%

115
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,600
the distance between B and C so I know

116
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,009
initially this might sound a little

117
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,439
confusing and it does take a little

118
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:36,329
guess in chapters no set quick easy way

119
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,939
to determine that but if you look at the

120
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:41,490
numbers and put one down one place and

121
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,980
start with unknown we know a and B is 8

122
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,680
units away all right now we gotta go the

123
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,790
next one B and C's 10 units we don't

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,009
know if that's to the left or the right

125
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,100
but with a and C only being two units

126
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:56,009
away 8 plus 2 is 10 and that perfectly

127
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,720
solves our linkage now hopefully if you

128
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:58,949
review these a little bit they'll start

129
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,720
to make a little bit more sense

130
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,490
initially I know it is a little bit

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,230
foreign to look at but hopefully we're

132
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,540
doing it a couple times we'll make it

133
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,290
quick and easy and it makes for a great

134
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,290
quiz question
