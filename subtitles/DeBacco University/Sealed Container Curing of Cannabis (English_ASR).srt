1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,240
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,359
going to go over a very common method of

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,040
curing cannabis

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,359
and it's carrying cannabis in sealed

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,359
containers so if we can pick up some

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,919
of important information here to make

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,919
your occurring process as successful as

8
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
possible

9
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:24,320
[Music]

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,679
all right let's look at sealed container

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,439
curing of cannabis

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,358
we see an image of that right here one

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,000
example we have a humidity control pack

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,160
cannabis buds in a sealed container here

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,679
so first off we want to limit the size

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,078
of the container

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,159
so since containers are used will be of

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,799
limiting size the buds should be removed

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,000
from the branches this may have been

20
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,599
done during the trimming

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,679
stage but this may need some extra

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
attention to detail to ensure only the

23
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,039
chosen material

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,878
enters the curing process now i say

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,920
limited size of containers this doesn't

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,439
mean you want to have like a small

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
little micro size container

28
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,960
but if you have these giant large

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,320
containers it might sound really easy

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,079
i can just control the environment in

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,600
there it can be a lot harder

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,198
so typically using smaller size

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,159
containers trimming down the buds to

34
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,079
ensure only the

35
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,719
valuable materials placed in them is

36
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,478
something that is advised

37
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,239
now that chosen container what container

38
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,640
actually going to put the buds in well

39
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,640
wide mouth mason jars as pictured here

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,719
typically are the preferred option

41
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,960
a 32 ounce jar on average holds about an

42
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,879
ounce of dried bud plus or minus

43
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,879
the goal is to leave about 25 air

44
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,158
airspace within the container

45
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,078
you don't want to go through and pack

46
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,040
the full container you want to leave a

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,759
little bit of

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,799
space there to allow some movement of

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,799
those buds and they don't want to

50
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,520
compact and do any physical damage to

51
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,520
them

52
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,200
also bigger scent necessarily better as

53
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,399
the container gets large

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,079
larger the ability to ensure a

55
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,118
controlled drying process and curing

56
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,199
process becomes

57
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,478
more challenging simply because the

58
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,560
large volume of

59
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,519
the mold has an increased odds of

60
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,280
developing

61
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,560
now these wide mouth mason jars very

62
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,840
commonly used

63
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,118
used at great extent i've had some

64
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,960
people say that they don't want to use

65
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,159
these simply because they live in area

66
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,078
prone to earthquakes

67
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,520
i typically advise them you might want

68
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,359
to reconsider where you're living

69
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,038
because these are glass jar so keep that

70
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,639
in mind you probably other than the

71
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,799
photo here probably don't want to be

72
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,119
storing them in this particular

73
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,560
kind of orientation simply because you

74
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,000
don't want to have the risk of damage to

75
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,239
them or breaking

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,598
of that glass mason jar so we see here

77
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,319
we want to shake it up well

78
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,000
the idea comes here for to avoid the

79
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,000
buds from becoming a mass

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,680
and occasional shaking it may be advised

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,959
to keep each bud separate

82
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,120
that's part of the reason why we want to

83
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,640
leave that 25 percent gap there

84
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,680
you want to avoid over shaking to limit

85
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,679
the amount of physical damage that

86
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
occurs but kind of just a light general

87
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,120
shaking or even just turning of the

88
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,080
container can be enough just to ensure

89
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,878
that each bud

90
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,239
is consistently independent of one

91
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,280
another

92
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,480
and then where do you want to put these

93
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,560
well a dark place most containers should

94
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,318
used do not block light completely so be

95
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,239
sure to place your containers in a dark

96
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,158
cool environment you could see here a

97
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,120
dark room kind of like that wine

98
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,719
cellar-like

99
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,480
concept there where it can be a little

100
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,239
bit light and kind of reduced light as

101
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,598
far as intensity and duration goes

102
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,360
but overall want to keep them in a

103
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,719
relatively dark low light

104
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,560
environment and this is a process

105
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,479
that you don't want to set and forget

106
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,840
the curing process should be routinely

107
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,359
routinely checked on

108
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,878
this can be very important in the early

109
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,560
stages to the buds containing the

110
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,759
highest moisture content

111
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,840
here we can see three different

112
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,079
containers relatively similar

113
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,598
temperatures relatively same humidities

114
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,040
but definitely one is a little bit

115
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,318
different and this is something we do

116
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,400
want to be checking on because we want

117
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,280
to make sure we don't want to lose or

118
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,158
jeopardize the end harvest at this very

119
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,519
late stage

120
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,798
in the full process so this concept of

121
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,319
burping containers you may have heard

122
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,360
this burping the containers and valves

123
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,039
opening the container

124
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,480
a few times a day for the first week to

125
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,719
allow moisture to escape

126
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,919
and oxygen to replenish during this

127
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,680
process check for

128
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,199
follow odor as this can be a sign that

129
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
mold is starting to develop

130
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,639
so burning is just simply open the

131
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
container and then closing it back up

132
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,479
again

133
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,000
allow that gas exchange to occur rather

134
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,318
any moisture to kind of leave and allow

135
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
oxygen to replenish within the container

136
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,238
typically done daily at least during the

137
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,239
first week

138
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,080
expected humidity progression so there

139
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,519
will be a decrease overall

140
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,360
using a hydrometer should be used to

141
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,478
know the exact humidity level of the

142
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,400
curing environment

143
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,478
the target humidity range usually around

144
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,638
60 to 65 percent

145
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,399
sometimes you can get a little too low

146
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,918
sometimes you can get on the higher side

147
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,000
and we can see each one

148
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,439
of these individual containers has its

149
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,360
own kind of gauge there

150
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,478
so as we saw previously just because you

151
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,960
have it in one doesn't mean

152
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,680
every container is going to be exactly

153
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,120
the same

154
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,040
good to know if one's running a little

155
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,439
high one's running a little low

156
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,560
because it really can prevent long-range

157
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,399
problems or ultimately

158
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,759
loss of that particular container or

159
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,839
crop

160
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,919
so after that first week routine checks

161
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,279
can go down to twice daily

162
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,839
from twice daily i should say to

163
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,839
basically every day so checking them

164
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,918
morning and night and just checking them

165
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,279
once a day after that first week

166
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,359
as you get to that week's two you know

167
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,038
two and three you can decrease that the

168
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
drying process seems to be going good

169
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,240
drying process is progressing well you

170
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
can even go down to

171
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,400
uh in every other day routine check

172
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,399
every other two you know skip a day skip

173
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,719
two days if anything's going well there

174
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,478
as you get later in that process because

175
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,000
you'll have less and less variability

176
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,879
and closer to that ideal range

177
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,800
so how do you know when you've reached

178
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,478
the end of curing will some growers use

179
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,720
three weeks until final cure others up

180
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,240
to eight weeks into the final cure

181
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,919
kind of gauge cut the buds are looking

182
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,519
engage the humidity levels and then once

183
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,319
you've reached the end of your curing

184
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,680
process

185
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,439
keep in mind you're not quite done yet

186
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,720
you're almost there the next step after

187
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,319
caring is storing

188
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,759
there's other videos here in debacle

189
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,000
university that you're welcome to take a

190
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,639
look

191
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
at to ensure you have a quality storing

192
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,600
process

193
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,038
to keep all that hard work that you did

194
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,120
to keep it as long

195
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,120
as possible in peak condition
