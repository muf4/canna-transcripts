1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
okay I'm going to discuss carbon dioxide

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,240
enrichment so first off it's part

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,189
remember that carbon dioxide is in the

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,530
air naturally you can see there's a lot

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,960
of nitrogen is the highest percentage in

6
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:14,579
the air or even breathing right now I'll

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,519
come back so it is in air but at low

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,609
levels so enriching that is particularly

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,320
can help plants grow because of the

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,260
increased amount of carbon which they

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,579
need to produce these sugars so first

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,130
off let's start with the basics so what

13
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,559
is co2 LLC a two-stroke for carbon

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,899
dioxide carbon oxide is heavier than air

15
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,488
so it will sink it's a non flammable gas

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,308
that occurs naturally in the atmosphere

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:41,189
at levels of about 405 parts per million

18
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:43,349
ppm however when the levels go below 200

19
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,929
parts per million growth constant in

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,510
plants as a result of the reduction in

21
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:50,939
the photosynthetic process this is why

22
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:53,039
trying to maintain 405 parts per million

23
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:56,399
or even greater can affect plant growth

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,520
but specialist growth can stun if those

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,390
levels go too low and the importance of

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,010
co2 in a plant

27
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,509
well carbon in the carbon oxygen is

28
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:06,629
converted into sugar or glucose

29
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:09,000
molecules that the plant produces the

30
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:11,099
carbon in organic matter originates as

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,750
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere so that

32
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:14,429
carbon dioxide is coming the atmosphere

33
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,099
plus water and light producing sugars

34
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,229
and oxygen well those sugars can be

35
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,969
stored in the leaves and where did that

36
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:23,009
come from that ultimately can compost

37
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,289
down the form you know organic matter

38
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,900
well that carbon source originally was

39
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,460
carbon dioxide from the air so plants

40
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,700
are so good at assembling that into a

41
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,379
more stable compound here the sugar but

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,530
it can be used for a whole host of

43
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,179
reasons come that's in Richmond Opperman

44
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,680
acid provides carbon for the plants

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,840
biomass and sugar production so that

46
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,430
c6h12o6 that glucose is also important

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,149
for building components of the actual

48
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,009
plant itself

49
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,960
in addition to those sugars it can be

50
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,700
used for other purposes the lack of

51
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,798
carbon dioxide so if we reduced carbon

52
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,170
dioxide can often be a limiting factor

53
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,689
in this process so in rich in a

54
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,030
greenhouse or grow facility with carbon

55
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:05,519
dioxide has been around for many years

56
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,890
because that is directly can impact

57
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,679
plant growth swimming water and light

58
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,479
are all at sufficient levels so

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,539
photosynthetic rate that's what PS is

60
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,429
short for

61
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:17,259
in light in different carbon dioxide

62
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,330
levels so adding extra carbon dioxide

63
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:22,389
will be the most beneficial for plants

64
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,430
that are receiving high light levels so

65
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:26,829
in the example here of low light levels

66
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,569
we could see higher low levels of carbon

67
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,310
dioxide really don't make any difference

68
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:32,409
however once you buy the low light

69
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,330
levels and increase that light intensity

70
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:36,489
we could see the low level of carbon

71
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,250
dioxide levels off at a much lower rate

72
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,750
of photosynthesis higher level of

73
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,479
Carmack said here will increase the

74
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,709
photosynthetic rate here so again at

75
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:46,689
those low light intensities can be a

76
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,400
limiting factor in this case if you're

77
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:50,409
adding co2 there's gonna be really no

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,480
benefit to that we see the same thing

79
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:55,359
here where we have insufficient so

80
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,399
you're too excessive co2 but in a lower

81
00:02:55,359 --> 00:03:00,299
light and a higher light and we see the

82
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,250
same pattern here higher light levels

83
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:04,930
with higher co2 levels can result in an

84
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,909
increased rate of photosynthesis

85
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,420
assuming water and nutrients are all

86
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:12,519
above optimum so co2 enrichment can

87
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:15,878
impact yield adding or enriching an

88
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,620
environment with co2 to about 0.12

89
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,590
percent or 1200 parts per million can

90
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,659
increase plant growth by 30% no research

91
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,870
often debates the ideal co2 level many

92
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:28,539
will consider this to be too high

93
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,879
typically levels we're talking about 700

94
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:32,789
to 1200 is kind of where you're seeing

95
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,049
an increase in potential for yield

96
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:37,269
however what is agreed upon is levels

97
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:40,930
above 1500 to be about here on the graph

98
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,939
are not economically viable that 700 to

99
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,409
1000 is a general range recommended some

100
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:45,909
are running this high is 1200 depending

101
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:47,590
on what controller units they're using

102
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:48,969
to ensure they're always within that

103
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,519
seven to a thousand part per million

104
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:53,560
level but about 1500 as we can see here

105
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,200
we're kind of having that reduced growth

106
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,878
and it's simply you're wasting money on

107
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,979
carbon accidents and that beneficial to

108
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:01,750
the plant

109
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:03,429
now dangerous levels of co2 is replying

110
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,539
particularly to humans there is carbon

111
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,879
dioxide toxicity

112
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:10,000
however those hulls have to approach

113
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,739
5,000 parts per million and above are

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,799
not advised for people to be in this

115
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,329
result and my headedness or worse due to

116
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,918
lack of oxygen you can see some of the

117
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,300
symptoms here as increases in co2 level

118
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,839
but as far as what we're trying to keep

119
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,160
our plants at 0.12 percent would be

120
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,409
ideal

121
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,350
and you can see that it takes even 1%

122
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,260
here to start having any terminated

123
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,930
toxicity for humans so it's well below

124
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:39,099
and it didn't get any concern but when

125
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,310
you start getting higher levels that's

126
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,870
where we start getting those cautioned

127
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,280
the ideal temperature was co2 so when

128
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,590
enriching with curved ax head the ideal

129
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,799
temperature can increase from 85 degrees

130
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:52,269
Fahrenheit to about 90 and above 90 then

131
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,310
we'll start to see a decrease in the

132
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:56,139
photosynthetic rate so the increased

133
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,639
carbon dioxide allows our to run our

134
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:59,229
plants a little bit warmer take

135
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,110
advantage of potential heat that we may

136
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:05,080
be trying to exhaust anyway an increase

137
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,639
in plant production the importance of

138
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,079
ventilation and grow space of people and

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,269
ventilation is still important

140
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,859
co2 depletion especially in greenhouses

141
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:14,259
or grow tent environments can be quite

142
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,759
common because of the confined space the

143
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:18,819
area should be sealed to better regulate

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,039
co2 levels so you're not wasting co2 out

145
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,500
some vents or something so it's

146
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,810
important to keep in mind that

147
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,250
ventilation is important and which

148
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,410
creates a delicate balance between

149
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,170
venting out hot air in this case a

150
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,689
particular and exhausting out the

151
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,910
precious co2 that you've added so here

152
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:39,189
I've chosen to add the co2 about midway

153
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:42,939
through the grow tent in my exhaust port

154
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:45,069
here at the very top of the tent the co2

155
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:46,449
can increase plant metabolism which is

156
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:48,370
great because that can cause more rapid

157
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:50,829
growth increased nutrient consumption

158
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,629
filling the space quicker and greater

159
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:54,250
water usage so keep in mind that when

160
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,589
you are facing with co2

161
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,420
there's my tubing right here it can also

162
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:00,459
cause that rapid growth which is great

163
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,689
but that can cause increase in nutrient

164
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:04,359
consumptions who want to be make sure

165
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:05,469
we're feeding them appropriately I fill

166
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,150
in the space quicker so that could

167
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,520
