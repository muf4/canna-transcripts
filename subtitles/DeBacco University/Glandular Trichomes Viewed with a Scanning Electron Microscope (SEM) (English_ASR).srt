1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
debacco University video go through

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,480
glandular tricomes viewed with a

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,919
skinning electron microscope to really

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,920
give you a different perspective and a

5
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:12,638
different look at these structures that

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,699
you've probably seen quite a bit from a

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,759
macroscopic

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:17,759
[Music]

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,719
standpoint so this is really going to be

10
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:27,879
kind of a detailed look at these uh

11
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:29,160
basic structures so hopefully you tune

12
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,759
in I'm going to read some of the

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,479
information so you can really focus at

14
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,039
looking at the Quality images uh

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,199
provided here those quality images were

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,039
provided uh based on This research

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,879
article here so if you want to take a

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,640
look at them or kind of look at some

19
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:46,039
more of the details of the full study

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,159
you're welcome to um use this citation

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,320
to find this but great um great images

22
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:54,038
uh provided here which I encouraged to

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,840
share with you so first off just the

24
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,120
varie is being grown uh Mobi dick and

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,320
space queen so they'll be abbreviated MD

26
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,399
and SQ throughout this just to give you

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,118
a little bit of idea of uh kind of the

28
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,118
abbreviation uh for these because

29
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,879
there'll be a lot of text here so first

30
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:11,359
off start with a little macroscopic view

31
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:13,239
the infloresence comparison the

32
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,400
morphology of developing infloresence in

33
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:18,560
two cannabis genotypes um examined here

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,359
again here we're looking at Moby Dick at

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,960
3 weeks of infloresence development and

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,400
then for B here we've got space queen

37
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,919
also at 3 weeks you can see the

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,759
different morphological differences um

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,040
here as well for um here we're looking

40
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,159
at Mo dick on the left and space queen

41
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,799
here on the right again at six weeks in

42
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,799
the arrows in both in all of these it

43
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,200
show the position where which the bra

44
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,680
were sampled for microscopic

45
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,439
observations so these different regions

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,479
right here and these different regions

47
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:51,279
right here are the areas we're going to

48
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:52,519
be looking at in a very zoomed in

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
portion so I can kind of get

50
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:57,039
appreciation for where the researchers

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,879
were looking at now again the

52
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,359
comparisons the morphology of developing

53
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,599
infloresence in canas genotypes was

54
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,078
examined uh looking over here the

55
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,519
stigmas uh which is readed by the St

56
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,120
appear as an orange uh Brown coloration

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,480
the tricomes it can be seen on the Kix

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,680
which is located right here in on

59
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:19,280
inflorescence uh leaves uh of the strain

60
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,360
for Mobi dick at 8 weeks and we're

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,199
looking at um E and F tricomes and bra

62
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,280
The Strain space queen um at 8 weeks

63
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,518
here the arrows point to the stigmas

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,840
again that appear Brown and orange as

65
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,560
well on that variety for uh letter G

66
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,640
here the dried in fluoresence or the bud

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,239
of Boby dick after harvest the buds can

68
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,039
has been trimmed to remove the

69
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,000
inflorescent leaves and the arrows point

70
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,158
to the dried stigmas we can see right

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,120
here so again just giving you a little

72
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:48,799
bit of that macroscopic view before we

73
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,200
now get into the detailed microscopic

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,719
view so first off to understand the

75
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,639
tricomes we will be looking at um

76
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:57,840
there's the capitate stocked tricomes

77
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,279
the capitate cile and the bulbous

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,439
tricomes and we could kind of see here

79
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,120
the stock the cile and the bulbus

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:09,759
tricomes I'm here looking at the bulbus

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,158
being the very very small um in size

82
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,120
comparison uh the cap cesil are

83
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,719
basically the stocked without the stock

84
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,680
so to speak is a way to think about it

85
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,598
that's looking straight down and if we

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,879
look here you can see the little tiny

87
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,238
tiny ones of the bulbas the cesil are

88
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:25,878
kind of the little bit looks like little

89
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,920
water droplets and the capitate stocked

90
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:29,318
are the ones here now description again

91
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,039
the stocked are the largest most

92
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:33,399
abundant um can be seen with the naked

93
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,318
eye um and they're rich SCE of the THC

94
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,280
and CBD the cesil ones are smaller than

95
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,280
their stock tricomes but

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,479
still um able to be seen and appear when

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,039
the plants begin to flower they are less

98
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:47,399
potent but still produce the imense

99
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,158
amounts of canids as well as tpin and

100
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,438
the little tiny bulbous ones are the

101
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:53,679
smallest of the three types they give

102
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:55,199
that glossy kind of Sheen to the plant

103
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,680
despite their size they can contribute

104
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,158
to the over AR canav and turpine profile

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,400
of the plant so now let's into some of

106
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,280
the research images and again I'm going

107
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,920
to try to provide some of the narrations

108
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,239
here on the left so you can kind of

109
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,839
focus on the images and I'll try to

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,120
point and highlight different aspects so

111
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,840
all images here of the lower bra surface

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,158
at 3 and six weeks of infloresence

113
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,959
development again we're looking at Moby

114
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,839
Dick a stocked c triome um in the

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,600
foreground here right where the arrow um

116
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,078
is pointing compared to the smallest

117
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,720
bulbous ones in the background so you

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,400
can definitely see uh the diff the size

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,840
difference um here looking at BNC here

120
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,319
uh looking at these two the bulbus

121
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,638
tricomes formed on short picles here

122
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,159
which are basically that little short

123
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,478
supportive structure uh for D the non-

124
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,439
glander tricomes as we can see with ha

125
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:43,000
there's the kind of the ones that look

126
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,839
like points little finger points uh

127
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,279
formed next to the bulbus which is the

128
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,000
one right here uh and seyl capitate

129
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,399
triome right here again give me that

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,279
that comparison and really that really

131
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,758
zoomed in um look that we see here and

132
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,559
what is noticed here these little looks

133
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,600
like little mouths in the background are

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,478
abundant stomata and can be seen and the

135
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,520
raised epidermal surfaces and for those

136
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,240
don't know those ones are going to open

137
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,279
and close and those are going to

138
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,519
regulate water um evapor for

139
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,079
transpiration and carbon dioxide and

140
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,159
oxygen gas exchange in the plant so

141
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,959
again we're looking specifically at the

142
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,680
tricomes but there are other structures

143
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,918
present nandal hairs um looking at right

144
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,038
here are interspaced with the cesil

145
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,879
capitate trigones on a young Brack so we

146
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:27,719
can see kind of they're intermixed here

147
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,240
as well so kind of a cool look all right

148
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,479
so those triome types all image of the

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,079
lower bra surface again three three 6

150
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,560
weeks in development here we're looking

151
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,478
at the magnified view of the cesil

152
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,000
capitate Trion when fully formed head

153
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:41,879
surrounded by a cuticle so it looks like

154
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,439
that kind of like a dome like look looks

155
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,519
like it's almost like a water bag and is

156
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,839
filled with a lot of those cabes and

157
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,758
Turpin she here's the precursor of the

158
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,879
cesil capitate triome pointed here where

159
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,800
the arrow is indicating in mature

160
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,360
stocked capitate tricomes with fully

161
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,840
formed heads adjacent uh to one another

162
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,759
so here we're seeing kind of point in

163
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,599
time but the difference in morph

164
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,720
ological formation here the mature stock

165
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,639
triom is formed in large numbers and a

166
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,039
great density note the presence of a

167
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,720
small bubbles triome right over here on

168
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:15,038
the right it's a non- glander triome um

169
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,639
in the background um as well eyes the

170
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,800
magnified view of the head of the stock

171
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,160
capitate triome with fully formed

172
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,598
cuticle surrounding the head so again

173
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,319
we're looking at those really really

174
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,759
zoomed in um portions here of the

175
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,120
plant now looking at that triome uh

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,160
development let me move myself out of

177
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
the way here here uh the um capitate

178
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,120
triome development again we're looking

179
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,038
still at Mobi dick lower bra surface 3

180
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,240
to 6 weeks at 3 weeks most capitate

181
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,639
troms at the tip of the Brack are ceile

182
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,478
but few we can see at the arrows have

183
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,240
started to develop stocks so early on in

184
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:50,918
development and we're seeing some

185
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,038
progressing or what they will progress

186
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,878
to non glander triome hairs can be seen

187
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,918
they look like Thorns but again this is

188
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,520
a macroscopic a microscopic view here um

189
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,560
so they look large

190
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,878
for uh image B the stock capitate

191
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,240
tricomes forming first along the mid

192
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,400
vein of the bra abundant cile capitate

193
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,800
triom can be seen in the background

194
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,758
together with the non- glanular hairs

195
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,439
kind of mixture here into the stocked

196
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,639
ones of course so over here looking at C

197
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,959
six weeks stock capitate tricomes can be

198
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,960
seen densely packed together again this

199
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,719
is kind of the goal of Growers to have a

200
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,519
lot of those very closely packed

201
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,800
together high density give me a high

202
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,839
amount of canab and tpin D here the

203
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,759
range of stocked lengths can be seen so

204
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,839
they're not all the same length with one

205
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,360
trium stocked in which the head has been

206
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,679
uh detached which is where we see the

207
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,479
arrow here so it should have the little

208
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,759
cap on top that one does not and lastly

209
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,079
an e view of the edge of the bracket six

210
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,479
weeks of infloresence development

211
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,439
showing greater abundance of the stocked

212
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:51,839
capitate triom on the lower compared to

213
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,680
the upper bra surface uh triom stocked

214
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,638
lengths are also variable here and we

215
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,240
see more down here in the lower surface

216
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,560
than in that upper portion now looking

217
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,158
at space queen uh again we're looking

218
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,959
here at the lower Brack surface again

219
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:05,478
three to six weeks at three weeks most

220
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:09,878
capitate tricomes are at the tip of the

221
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:11,318
Brack are cile uh look progressing to be

222
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,599
close-up view showing the mixture of the

223
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,800
cile and capitate tricomes with bulbous

224
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,279
tricomes in non- glandular hairs those

225
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,918
kind of points that we see here there

226
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,239
are no stock capitate tricomes in this

227
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,878
image here uh C through e so this row

228
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,879
right here the pre pre secretory or the

229
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,319
cile Tricom showing the outlines of pre

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,080
secretory disc cells kind of look like

231
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,440
little mushrooms um there if you will

232
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,919
progressing on to uh f a range of

233
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,479
stocked lengths have developed in the

234
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,319
capitate triom and cile triom can be

235
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,320
seen in the background again AR range

236
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,680
when they're growing through and develop

237
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,480
they don't don't happen all at the same

238
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,000
time they happen the same general time

239
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,399
that's why you get that variance there

240
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,039
uh for G at week six C stocked capitate

241
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,799
troms are densely packed together on the

242
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,480
underside of the Brack and have formed

243
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,919
long stocks as we see here and different

244
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,360
than we saw with the previous variety M

245
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,039
deck in h the some stocked capitate

246
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,159
trums that form at the edge of the Brack

247
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,838
of extremely long stocks up to 1,000

248
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,319
micrometers with the arrows located

249
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,399
right here see one that's definitely

250
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,959
longer than the rest and eyes is the

251
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,919
magnified view of the capitate trium

252
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,958
showing fully formed heads surrounded by

253
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,000
the cuticle so again great kind of view

254
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,759
here uh makes them look Larger than Life

255
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,679
but this is actually what's going on in

256
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,838
the kind of macroscopic view you might

257
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,120
be more used to seeing and kind of what

258
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,519
does that kind of look like well here we

259
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,759
see kind of that macroscop view the bra

260
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:37,078
of space queen and M dick uh this

261
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,838
one um is space queen this one's M dick

262
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:40,879
at 6 weeks of infloresence development

263
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,079
with abundant triome development the

264
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,320
arrows indicate in point 2 the

265
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:49,159
approximate position where the BRS were

266
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,519
sampled getting here to uh image part C

267
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,838
to quantify triome density the bra were

268
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,839
removed and placed under the dissecting

269
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,760
microscope at 50 times magnification and

270
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,959
the polygon lesser tool was used to

271
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,879
trace the out line of each segment as we

272
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,679
kind of see here in the black outline

273
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,879
there the position of each capitate

274
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:10,199
troken was marked using a pen and 5px

275
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,278
thickness and then counted so what did

276
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,680
that kind of look like what does that

277
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:17,200
data come back and say well here we're

278
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,559
looking at kind of the uh simulation of

279
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,160
that data and here we see the

280
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,479
distribution of the capitate trums on

281
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:28,240
the bra again space queen would be a and

282
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,320
c and Moby Dick would be B and D this is

283
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,560
at 3 weeks this is at 6 weeks so we can

284
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,040
see the change that occurs and the black

285
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,278
dots represent where they're located uh

286
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,360
e looks at the density of those uh

287
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:45,078
tricomes on the upper and lower surfaces

288
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,159
of the BR so a d would be the um the

289
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:49,958
adaxial that would be the upper surface

290
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,639
and a and b would be the lower surface

291
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:55,518
the clear is the lower the black is the

292
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:58,399
upper um here at 6 weeks again

293
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,919
progressing down to um f here we can see

294
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,278
the average trome density of the upper

295
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,120
bra surfaces is a function of the number

296
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,879
of weeks of of flowering period and then

297
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,519
lastly G is the density of those cidate

298
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:12,559
triom and bra as a function of position

299
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:15,480
of sampling with the inflorescent top

300
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,439
middle and bottom tier now what we are

301
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,639
noticing is these uh different letters

302
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,959
and getting different significance

303
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:24,600
levels we could see that that um here

304
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:27,199
with the a the abir which is the lower

305
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,879
portion tend to have a greater average

306
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,639
triome density look look at the average

307
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,759
trium density as well looking at those

308
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,759
different um periods of time and we

309
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:39,720
could see this again those Arrow bars

310
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:42,159
indicate there is a general progression

311
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,959
um but occurs you know slowly over time

312
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,879
and kind of Peaks around that week six

313
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,000
of flowering and lastly here looking at

314
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,600
the space queen versus the Moby Dick the

315
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,120
average trom density um overall the

316
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,360
bottom the mid and the top we could see

317
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,159
mby dick being much more consistent uh

318
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,519
bottom middle and top tier and space

319
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,799
queen favoring the bottom in the mid and

320
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,000
a little bit less on the top always good

321
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,919
to compare

322
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,919
varieties now we're talking at the

323
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,240
comparison of our stock tricomes again

324
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:16,759
looking at the diameter um in a and the

325
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,320
length uh down here in C genotypes mob

326
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,879
dick and space queen again mobid dick

327
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,639
here in the First Column space queen in

328
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,919
the second one at 3 and six weeks uh

329
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,560
looking at the uh gland head diameter

330
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,319
was significantly greater at 6 weeks

331
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,599
compared to 3 weeks in both genotypes

332
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,560
and in Moby Dick compared to S screen at

333
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,959
6 weeks so we're seeing a little bit of

334
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:39,000
that um difference and change over time

335
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,719
now uh the capitate tricomes length in

336
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,919
the geot types at 3 and six weeks of the

337
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,000
flowering period here as we can clearly

338
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:46,639
see the stock length again this is the

339
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,519
gland diameter this is the stock length

340
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,759
we can definitely see some um

341
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,720
differences um there compared to the 3

342
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,838
weeks compared to the 6 weeks showing

343
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,160
that overall development how they

344
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,040
actually look well if we turn our

345
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,838
attention over to here the development

346
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:03,838
of those stock capitate tricomes along

347
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,920
the mid uh veins of lower bra surfaces

348
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,160
of cannabis genotype mobid dick up here

349
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,479
and compared to space queen at 6 weeks

350
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:14,120
of influence development so again there

351
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,800
are some different morphological changes

352
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,440
it might be a little harder to see using

353
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,319
a loop but from a um scanning electron

354
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,000
microscope makes it very distinctive you

355
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,839
can see much longer stalks to space

356
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,078
queen compared to mobid

357
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,120
deck now we look at that elongation here

358
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:30,559
again I know this is pretty deep

359
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,159
detailed so appreciate you hanging with

360
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,799
us uh Tricom stock elongation of

361
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,439
capitate tricomes of chemistry and type

362
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,799
for moi dick early development of stock

363
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,360
rising from the extension of the

364
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,958
epidermal cells of the bra tissue and we

365
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,320
could see that here with the arrow right

366
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:49,359
right there is where it's located

367
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,320
progressing on to uh image B A Ring of

368
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,159
six raised epidermal cells demarks the

369
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,759
early initiation of the stock so we're

370
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,600
not quite 100% sure of the exact

371
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,120
formation or the signaling that requires

372
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,040
this but we are able to distinctly see

373
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,759
these morphological changes for C here

374
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,759
focusing of course you know where that

375
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,919
arrow is this is the elongation of the

376
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:14,600
stock occurs by the expansion and upward

377
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,759
growth of the epidermal cells seen here

378
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,079
in the longitudinal section through the

379
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,800
stock so this is kind of the point at

380
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,319
where things are initiating um from

381
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:27,958
there now looking at d and

382
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,759
e um here and here long longitudinal

383
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,559
section view of the fully form stock and

384
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,680
capitate triome showing the involvement

385
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,958
of the epidermal and the hypodermal

386
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:39,078
cells of the stock so we're looking

387
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:41,119
physically at those um structures there

388
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:43,439
that are developing that are forming

389
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,320
this ultimately larger macroscopic

390
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,240
structure in F last lastly looks at the

391
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,879
crosssection view of the stock showing

392
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,278
the organization of six cells and the

393
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,759
interior of the cells can be seen here

394
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:59,639
with the arrow um so it's kind of kind

395
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,079
of a unique 1 2 3 4 5 six here there

396
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,278
kind of this unique and distinctive

397
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,719
structure um something you may not have

398
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,759
considered before but hopefully

399
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,399
developing greater appreciation for

400
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:12,159
what's occurring in each of those little

401
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,480
tricomes the attachment of those um head

402
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,719
regions so we're looking here um shown

403
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,600
for Mobi dick the stock cells um here

404
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,040
and the progression of the head so kind

405
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,399
of that more familiar structure that

406
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,039
we're used to seeing uh B and see show

407
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,159
the attachment of the stocks to the

408
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,000
glandular heads we can see right here

409
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,120
that point where that kind of cap

410
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,078
attaches to that supportive stock I'm

411
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,078
shown in two dried samples which is why

412
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:36,599
they look like they have a little more

413
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,278
texture to them progressing down here to

414
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,560
the bottom row D shows the top of the

415
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,958
stock showing the region um here to

416
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,518
which the gler Trum would attach to um

417
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,159
here of course it's been removed from

418
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,399
this we're just kind of Pop the top

419
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,759
right off pop the top of the of the

420
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,198
muffin so to speak and look at the

421
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,759
bottom uh E and F is a view of the

422
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:55,198
underside of the detached glandular

423
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,440
heads showing the appearance of the

424
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:00,359
underlying region uh which that would be

425
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,920
attached to the top of the triome stock

426
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,639
so this kind of shows the top portion if

427
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,838
you kind of flipped it over and looking

428
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,560
down at it to kind of show the texture

429
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,440
and the um cellular complexity that's

430
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,838
occurring on these

431
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,240
structures now resin excusion here so

432
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,000
when we're looking at the collapse of

433
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,039
the triome heads shown again for

434
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,440
genotype Mobi dick the Extrusion of

435
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,039
resonance formation of droplets are

436
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,600
shown Again by the arrows um here A and

437
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:29,759
B so is the the secretion from the bulis

438
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,600
uh tricomes uh and we're looking at c

439
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,278
and e uh C through E I should say

440
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,319
showing the secretion of the capitate TR

441
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:38,600
Chrome heads so a little different

442
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:40,240
formation but same basic concept and

443
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,480
idea where we're having that kind of

444
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,919
storage organ kind of bulb out in a

445
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,240
three-dimensional form F does show the

446
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:48,838
bulging of the cuticle which is Shing

447
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,600
the arrow due to the resin secretion

448
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,800
from inside the head there pushing it

449
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,079
again

450
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,799
outward uh G through I here shows

451
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,719
secretion of the resins caused by the

452
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,679
cuticle to develop the central uh

453
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,360
depression arrows where the arrows are

454
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,599
showing and the triome head uh to

455
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,880
collapse we can see again showing that

456
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:12,599
region there at those different

457
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,079
views J through I um through L uh shows

458
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,599
sorry the resonant secretion causes

459
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,879
triome heads to stick to one another and

460
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:21,078
came by the arrows here and the scale

461
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,480
bars are um um shown so again I should

462
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:24,438
have mentioned that before when you're

463
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,400
looking at these degrees of um

464
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,240
magnification we can see the different

465
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320
uh scale bars to kind of give you a

466
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,759
proportion there and again when they're

467
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,439
getting so dense here we're seeing that

468
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:37,519
kind of merger that connection of those

469
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,000
now we talk about cence which is kind of

470
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:43,079
the kind of the formation of the Harvest

471
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,919
and kind of people might say the the

472
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:48,759
dying of or the Aging of the plant um

473
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,160
this kind of shows that syence of those

474
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:53,558
heads so fully developed head with

475
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,320
intact cuticle no secretions or regions

476
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:57,119
or shrinking the cuticle has occurred at

477
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:59,639
this point arrows showing the points of

478
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,558
Ring of secory disk cells

479
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,080
B is looking at this shrinking of the

480
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,558
cuticle and shriveling of the head that

481
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:08,480
occurred likely due to to the resin

482
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:10,200
secretion uh C and D here the rupture of

483
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,720
the cuticle right where the arrow is

484
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,600
indicating here and here shows the dense

485
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,279
glandular appearance that is the

486
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:19,558
resinous material

487
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,000
underneath e e through F the shrink

488
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:23,079
engine collapse of the cuticle on the

489
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,359
mature glandular heads and this is

490
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:27,000
caused by the aggregation of the

491
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,839
underlying resonance material to in the

492
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,880
surface of the heads appearing conv

493
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,918
wrinkled right where those arrows are

494
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,240
pointing and a close-up of the dried um

495
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,520
resonance material right here got a

496
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,240
really tight uh zoom in there and H and

497
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:41,639
I showing the dried convolute appearance

498
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,400
of the granular heads that are

499
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,320
completely um B incent here is at the

500
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,559
very end of the life

501
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,240
cycle now look at the progression of

502
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,798
triome development and the inessence

503
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,000
here we see number of weeks in the

504
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:56,319
flowering period the trium stock

505
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,200
development the heads the resins and the

506
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,240
head inessence where does that exactly

507
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,880
occur um and these are looking at our

508
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,038
genotypes again um for Moby Dick and a

509
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,559
space queen the proportion of the stock

510
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,359
triome um increases exponentially with

511
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,000
time in the flying periods and it

512
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:15,119
maximizes around 8 weeks but we do see

513
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,880
that exponential increase with that kind

514
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,678
of peak occurring right around week

515
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,679
eight the process of dring heads desence

516
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,798
and secretion of resins and syence

517
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,400
begins around week five again here and

518
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,960
progresses to week eight so it's kind of

519
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,519
like that last kind of part of that that

520
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,798
curve the timing depicts here will vary

521
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,679
by genotypes so keep that in mind as

522
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,440
well as environmental conditions that

523
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,919
impose stresses on the plant which could

524
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,960
accelerate the process of gland your

525
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,559
head Essence and basically degreg so

526
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,840
these are hopefully under quote ideal

527
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,960
conditions now ccent triom heads

528
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:52,759
occurrence of a large number of ccent

529
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,440
cap glandular heads on 8 weeks old bra

530
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:58,038
of the genotypes M dick up here and

531
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,840
space queen Below in both samples those

532
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:02,079
heads did here to shriveled and shrunken

533
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,918
indicating a loss of resin had occurred

534
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,599
we can see that indicated right where

535
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,000
the arrows are located do see slightly

536
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:10,319
different structures there but we do see

537
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,319
that same kind of aging and that syence

538
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,918
of those triome heads which is why as

539
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,639
Growers you want to PE pick the peak

540
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:19,440
Harvest

541
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,679
Time so looking a little bit more at the

542
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,360
um details um here uh is looking at the

543
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,919
trio maturation cannabis as is the

544
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,000
changes in translucency and the changes

545
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,159
in the red SC in triome heads for

546
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,798
genotype hash plant progressing from

547
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,120
weeks 3 to week seven so we're seeing

548
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,558
this kind of progression over time and

549
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,678
amount that you know you can kind of qu

550
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,558
see through the plant a sharp reduction

551
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,280
and that transluc lucity and the raise

552
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:47,480
of the red score can be seen um here and

553
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,759
that's basically what they use to

554
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,360
indicate bra tissues at week eight of

555
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,960
flowering period which the reddish brown

556
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,678
stocked uh glandular heads can be seen

557
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,519
via the arrows that's located right here

558
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,080
especially in the lower half of the bra

559
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:03,639
looking at d a representation of the

560
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,519
proportional gland or heads that are

561
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,038
clear which are the blue circles

562
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,240
translucent which are the white circles

563
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:11,359
and red Brown which are the red circles

564
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,720
using the color space that they utilized

565
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,918
so this really gives you the quick kind

566
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,400
of a picture a quick kind of indication

567
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,320
of what category those tricomes fall

568
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,360
into regarding to their progression of

569
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,200
maturation E's looking at comparison of

570
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:25,678
the perance of the stock capitate triom

571
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,558

572
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,960
the left and under UV light on the right

573
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,960
dur the blue autof fluoresence that's

574
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,240
associated with glandular heads kind of

575
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,200
a cool image and then a closeup of the

576
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,038
glandular heads and enhanced exposure

aggradation of glander heads du the res

579
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,839
secretion can be seen also right here

580
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,919
where the arrow is indicating those

581
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,158
heads are kind of clumping together as

582
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,038
we saw

583
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,760
earlier now one thing I found

584
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,839
interesting here if you tuned in for

585
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,278
this long and thank you uh is the post

586
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:59,079
Harvest handling of our tricomes so the

587
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,919
effect of post Harvest handling

588
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,038
uh practice on capitate triome Integrity

589
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,120
this is the genotype push that they used

590
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:08,919
in this study so looking at letter A up

591
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,798
here it's a sample that was hand trimmed

592
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,080
to remove the inflorescent leaves before

593
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,240
drying shows majority of the tricomes

594
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,798
intact so Hand trimming being very

595
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,880
careful on hand trimming varieties uh

596
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:23,038
Here Pink Kush those tricomes are pretty

597
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,640
much intact or undisturbed looking at b

598
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,440
a close-up view of the tricomes and hand

599
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,919
trim sample showing all gland heads are

600
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,080
intact not just from that kind of zoomed

601
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,120
out version even zooming in a little bit

602
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,240
closer we can see the lack of damage now

603
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,519
C was a sample that was mechanically

604
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,038
trimmed to remove the inflorescent

605
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,240
leaves showing The Lofts of the tricomes

606
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:41,839
in many heads have become detached and

607
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,759
we can see that with the arrows we see

608
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,359
basically the stock here without that

609
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,919
nice little bulb on top it just kind of

610
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,359
like ends there's not that big bulb that

611
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,679
occurs on top basically they've been

612
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,399
removed um that's through the mechanical

613
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:56,640
trimming process D is the closeup

614
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,240
indicating again those mechanically

615
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,000
trimmed those basically heads are broken

616
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
off

617
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,839
especially at the edges of the BR are

618
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,720
the most likely to come in contact with

619
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,240
that Machinery enf shows the dry rocks

620
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,480
after 5 days of drying at 50 to 55%

621
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,200
relative humidity show the outlines of

622
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,038
the epidermal hypodermal cells that make

623
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,360
up the stock most glender heads are

624
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,599
intact with a few broken off indicated

625
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,359
by the arrows here so again this really

626
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,759
speaks to taking the time uh to you know

627
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,918
doing a hand trim would be great because

628
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:26,359
you're doing less damage long as you're

629
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,559
careful with hand trimming than

630
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:30,519
mechanical Harvester to those triome

631
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,960
heads so keep that in

632
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:35,119
mind uh lastly this show post Harvest

633
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,038
impact on those Tricom a

634
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,599
comparison here under four cannabis

635
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:41,319
genotypes have undergone post Harvest

636
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,199
drying so this is looking at how that

637
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,839
drying aspect impacts the triome

638
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,960
development D Record from 25 tricomes

639
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,839
with three replicate samples a is

640
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,840
looking at the genotype skunk gr heads

641
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,000
are fully form triome stocks are short

642
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,359
and no resonance released we could see

643
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,960
that here with the arrow uh B is the

644
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,599
temple spice triome stocks in are

645
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,400
intermediate in length and heads are

646
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,399
releasing resin again right where that

647
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,559
arrow is indicating a Healer for uh

648
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,320
letter C here TR long most have secreted

649
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:14,759
resin again showing where that arrow is

650
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:18,000
located right there uh D is looking at

651
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,759
the genotype terapen a where the trium

652
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,798
stocks are long many grams of trium

653
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,000
heads release resin many heads have also

654
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,519
detached uh e is the comparison of the

655
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,880
triom density and the four Camas

656
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,000
genotypes Based on data collected on the

657
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,559
uh the images and we can see the average

658
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,038
triome density um and we can see the

659
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:38,319
variance that occurs with the different

660
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:41,000
genotypes uh standard error bars are

661
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,678
shown on there f is looking at the

662
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,599
comparison of the proportion of stocked

663
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,240
versus unstocked triom in the four

664
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:49,278
genotypes looking at the um different

665
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,200
colorations here the stocked

666
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,200
representing the gray and the unstocked

667
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,038
representing the black coloration and

668
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,440
then lastly comparison of the portion of

669
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,158
the desicated incent tricomes in the

670
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,278
four genotypes

671
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,720
so this just speaks to again showing the

672
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,200
knowing your genotype knowing what

673
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,038
variety you're growing maybe growing it

674
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,960
multiple times to get an appreciation

675
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:11,440
for its characteristics and making that

676
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,038
selection can be very important because

677
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,120
as we can see here there's a great

678
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:17,640
variability um in that and one's not

679
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,158
necessarily better than the other just

680
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,360
understanding your own variety

681
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:24,080
understanding what it produces to

682
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,439
hopefully maximize and optimize your

683
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:29,240
yield in your canvas plants so hope you

684
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,480
like this kind of indepth uh microscopic

685
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,480
look at things um and we're able to tune

686
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,839
in to the end here it is a pretty

687
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,519
intense look but definitely take a look

688
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,759
at the research article some quality

689
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:43,558
images so you can appreciate those uh

690
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:43,558
tricomes hopefully on a whole new level
