1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,318
here in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,200
we're going to go over some mathematical

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,439
equations

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,440
so you know how to adjust your organic

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,160
matter and not just kind of eyeballing

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,399
it where you could

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,919
add way too much or if you're looking at

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
purchasing it you might not purchase

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
enough

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,320
all right let's get into adjusting

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,919
organic matter in soil

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,240
now as i said this will be a math kind

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,559
of a base kind of approach

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,600
so you're suggested to maybe let me go

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,599
through it once

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,079
pause it for yourself and then go back

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
over the information there to apply your

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,119
own information to it

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,800
so first off when we're adjusting

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,679
organic matter and soil we want to know

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,078
the present

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,600
organic matter percentage in the soil

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,039
the organic matter percentage in the

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,480
organic amendment we'll be adding in

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
this case i'm going to use peat moss as

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,839
an example as well as compost

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,238
and the percentage organic matter

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,000
desired in the mix of the two

29
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,759
the volume ratio of the two that must be

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
combined will be determined as

31
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,119
follows so you have to always start with

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,438
that soil test

33
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,599
and having an organic matter percentage

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,959
calculated on that soil test

35
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,399
so that is going to provide you with the

36
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,919
letter a here this would be the kind of

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
equation we're going to go over a is the

38
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
current

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,640
soil organic matter percentage in your

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,960
soil that's based on your soil test

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,560
b represents the organic percentage of

42
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,239
the organic amendment

43
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,240
now as i said you can assume you'll be

44
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:28,399
100 for peat moss

45
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,158
or compost are typically around 25 to 35

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,840
c would be the target soil organic

47
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,799
matter percentage after amendment has

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,560
been added

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,840
we're gonna use about five percent uh

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,439
for our target

51
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
this will calculate x which is the

52
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,000
fraction by weight of dry soil in the

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
final

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
mix and one minus x is the fraction by

55
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,519
weight of dry organic amendment needed

56
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,359
in the mix

57
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,200
we'll also take this one step further

58
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,478
and go from weight to actually a volume

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,000
which is what most people

60
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,560
usually purchase things in or tend to

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,239
think in so let's look at converting

62
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,079
weights to volumes

63
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,920
well the basic equation is going to be

64
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,798
to convert weights which is x and 1

65
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,519
minus x

66
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,360
to volumes since you know how one will

67
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,000
work with the material

68
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,159
a conversion must be made using the dry

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,959
bulk densities of the material to be

70
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,439
mixed

71
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,800
so ps located right here is the dry bulk

72
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,199
density of the soil

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,040
and for soil it's usually 1.0 to 1.2

74
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,439
grams per cubic centimeter

75
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,120
and that can also be usually found on

76
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,280
most soil reports

77
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,159
po represented right here is the dry

78
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,159
bulk density of the organic amendment

79
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,479
the dry bulk density for peat moss is

80
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,840
0.15 grams per cc

81
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,359
our compost is typically 0.5 to 0.7

82
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,360
grams per cc

83
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,640
again if you're using a different dry

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,640
bulk density for

85
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,878
your organic amendment try to research

86
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,279
and find out what the bulk density is of

87
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,919
that

88
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,598
amendment s and t here s is the volume

89
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,199
of parts of soil material

90
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,039
teas the volume parts of organic

91
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,199
amendments so when you divide

92
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,598
s by t you obtain the volume of parts

93
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,639
per soil per one volume of organic

94
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,399
amendment

95
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,719
so while this is a lot of information

96
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,560
here this is that background

97
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,800
let's go through an example and hope it

98
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,280
makes a little bit more sense here

99
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
so here's that example now keep in mind

100
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,919
right below me here

101
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,439
i provide you with what i've shown

102
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,158
before what a b c

103
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,000
x and 1 minus x stand for now i've given

104
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,679
us an example here to work with

105
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
this since if we sent our soil out we

106
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,640
get our organic matter percentage at 3.4

107
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,640
percent

108
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,639
we're going to be adding peat moss at a

109
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,399
which is considered to be 100 percent

110
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,000
and our target organic matter percentage

111
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,000
would be 5

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,519
so the question becomes how much peat

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,239
moss do i need to add

114
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,959
to my soil which is 3.4 percent to get

115
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,000
to that

116
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,199
target value of 5.0 percent or soil

117
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
organic matter

118
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,958
so let's go through that well we take

119
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,759
100 minus 5 which is the

120
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,280
b minus a which is the organic matter

121
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,239
percentage of the amendment in this case

122
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,080
pmos

123
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,480
minus the target organic matter

124
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,840
percentage we divide that by 100 minus

125
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,318
3.4

126
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,959
or in this case it'd be b minus c minus

127
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,679
a

128
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,199
100 which is the peat moss which is the

129
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,080
organic amended we'll be adding

130
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,438
minus the soil organic matter the a here

131
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,280
when we take this and

132
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,158
subtract those and divide it by that we

133
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,080
get 9.834

134
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,840
and x minus one is to get the fraction

135
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,720
by weight of the dry peat moss needed in

136
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,160
the mix

137
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,880
which is uh 0.0166

138
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,479
however we want to convert these weights

139
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,199
to volumes because that's typically how

140
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,439
we think

141
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
so this is all converted here to get to

142
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,959
the weights we're now going to take this

143
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,399
next step in the next slide to go to

144
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,239
volumes

145
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,519
so here we see the same numbers carried

146
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
over

147
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,719
and here's our x there's our x minus 1.

148
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,478
the ps is at 1.1 grams per cc

149
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,440
that would be the bulk density of the

150
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,120
soil and then po is the dry bulk density

151
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,918
of the organic amendment because this is

152
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,360
peat moss

153
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:53,198
we're using 0.15 grams per cc and we see

154
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,759
here we apply it to the equation right

155
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,240
here

156
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,040
we get our s we get our t we divide our

157
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
s by a t

158
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,160
and we get 8.076 so what does that

159
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,478
number

160
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,039
equate to our mean well that means so

161
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,360
you would add about eight parts of soil

162
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,439
per one part of peat moss which

163
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,240
translated would be eight cubic yards of

164
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,719
soil

165
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,600
to every one cubic yard of peat moss to

166
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,639
get to that

167
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,199
target level of 5.0 percent organic

168
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,800
matter

169
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,720
from that original start of 3.4 percent

170
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
so hopefully this kind of gives you some

171
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,400
information here to kind of go

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
through your own and to go back for just

173
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,839
one moment

174
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,759
with all this information here you can

175
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,758
easily find what a b and c

176
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,120
are you could take your soil test

177
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,759
reports apply

178
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,759
that information to this example here

179
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,199
and hopefully develop a calculation so

180
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,360
you'll know exactly

181
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,600
how much how many cubic yards to

182
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
purchase to ensure you're getting the

183
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,160
target

184
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,399
soil organic matter that you want

185
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,479
without overbuying or under buying

186
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,319
and this is a lot better than eyeballing

187
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,918
it so take a little time to go over this

188
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,918
it'll be worth it in the end
