1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,410
you may be familiar with the deter my

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,660
path assess but there's actually two

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,789
different types there's a null and

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,679
alternative hypothesis we're going to

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:14,579
explore what the difference is between

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,640
these two here so starting with the null

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,500
hypothesis no hypothesis is valid if it

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,600
cannot be tested no test is valid if it

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,579
results cannot disprove the hypothesis

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,830
niece is related to the null hypothesis

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,559
the null hypothesis is the formal

12
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,960
statement of the hypothesis not being

13
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,359
true in the tested results that will

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,530
support the null hypothesis so you know

15
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,700
right now you probably going through and

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,780
reading this and like the Terminator

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,500
like this doesn't really make a whole

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,600
lot of sense

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,100
we're gonna use an example in the next

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,219
slide that I think will help help this

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,460
process out the alternate hypothesis

22
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,260
though expects a difference or an effect

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,370
so the null hypothesis kind of like

24
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,960
saying nothing happened

25
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,209
and they alternate they're saying oh

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,128
look there was a difference what the

27
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,230
researcher seeks to prove through

28
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,899
testing is what the alternate hypothesis

29
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,969
involves is it's the opposite of the

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,969
null in this case something did happen

31
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,379
there wasn't output there was a result

32
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:13,829
so how does this look kind of in an

33
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,780
example well took an example here we're

34
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,989
looking at the effect of fertilizer X

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,659
and Plumpton growth so our alternate

36
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:24,000
hypothesis this is what the researcher

37
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,859
attempts to prove so this alternate

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,810
hypothesis here was the researcher

39
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,680
trying to prove application of

40
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,210
fertilizer x increases pumpkin growth

41
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,950
the null hypothesis keep in mind is the

42
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,959
opposite of that we're still looking at

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,409
the effect of fertilizer X and pumpkin

44
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,728
growth so the null hypothesis would be

45
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,770
application of fertilizer X does not

46
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:46,618
increase pumpkin growth this null

47
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:49,590
hypothesis what the visitor attempts to

48
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:51,420
disprove so in an example here

49
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,490
tend to disprove the fact that there is

50
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,890
no effect that is trying to show that

51
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:59,158
this will increase pumpkin growth here

52
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,040
that's the alternate Knolls like nothing

53
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,450
happens there when we're running our

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,299
tests though we look at these two

55
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,848
hypotheses we want to minimize results

56
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,159
based on chance as a result when I have

57
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,419
something called a control group

58
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,870
checking to make sure the same results

59
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,329
will not occur without test

60
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,209
intervention you see the control group

61
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,700
here with mice looking at non obese mice

62
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,140
and obese mice and comparing awesome

63
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:25,179
factors here and things that were

64
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:26,979
measured particularly fat group and

65
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,230
control group and calories from fat and

66
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:31,090
so on and so forth so this idea of the

67
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:33,578
control group what is this well let's go

68
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,128
back to our previous example so in here

69
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:37,989
would be our control group our control

70
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:40,598
group would make the pumpkin plants

71
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:42,640
grown with no foot fertilizer it could

72
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:45,039
be our control group in the sense that

73
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,348
maybe just the soil they're growing and

74
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,048
naturally makes them grow a little bit

75
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:52,238
better or worse so our control group

76
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:54,609
just sometimes the group that we poke do

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,500
nothing to and they might just get water

78
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:58,599
where we could have an example here

79
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,878
getting smaller doses of fertilizer or

80
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:02,858
greater just as a fertilizer the control

81
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,048
group in this case would be those that

82
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:06,430
got no fertilizer I don't want you

83
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,239
always to think that the control group

84
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,769
does something that you don't do

85
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:14,109
anything to an alternate kind of example

86
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:16,180
for our pumpkin plants again would be if

87
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:18,370
we gave plants fertilizer that the bag

88
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,049
recommended so if we look at a bag that

89
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,450
recommends a tablespoon per gallon of

90
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:24,489
fertilizer X that could also be our

91
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:26,199
control group that control group is

92
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,810
getting the labeled or the recommended

93
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,848
rate of fertilizer so again that control

94
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,430
group in summary is just something that

95
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:34,358
you want to be able to compare to and to

96
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,069
make sure you're not getting the same

97
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:37,540
results that occur without the

98
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:39,208
modifications that you're making to the

99
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:42,400
test group

100
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,319
lastly minimizing the results based on

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,879
chance there's all sorts of stats that

102
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,339
can be done here checking to see if the

103
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:50,078
same result could be caused by chance

104
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,479
example how likely to get four heads in

105
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,280
a row and flipping coins randomly versus

106
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,948
always starting with the coin on tails

107
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,318
be something that you could do your goal

108
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:02,620
is to develop an observed data point

109
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:04,418
that is consistently beyond the control

110
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,090
or in this case the average here and

111
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:08,980
this would be the typical average you

112
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,598
could look at average height thinness in

113
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:12,878
a grade there's two be the average

114
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:14,560
height and looking for something here

115
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,319
very unlikely these really very tall

116
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,629
kids a very short edge here we're using

117
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:22,269
stats and statistical analysis to

118
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:24,459
determine that hey there's results that

119
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:27,069
we're seeing may not be based on chance

120
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,399
but might be influenced by the test

121
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,769
program

122
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:32,769
that were instituting so it's kind of

123
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:35,379
just a general overview of our null and

124
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:37,359
alternate hypothesis and hopefully the

125
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:39,788
example here I'm looking at fertilizer

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,250
on plant growth is a way to kind of be

127
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:44,939
able to better understand the comparison

128
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,939
between these two
