1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,879
okay here i'm going to go over an

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,400
introduction to biology and how to be

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,960
successful so you're not feeling like

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,960
this cat

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:17,199
[Music]

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,719
so looking at biology i don't want you

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,000
simply to memorize that's what a

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,160
textbook is for and

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,079
as a reference what i want to be able to

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,160
do is to look at something determine hey

11
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,919
this is a normal quote healthy leaf

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,199
how can we work with that information

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,640
that we may gain

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,480
looking at this leaf we can see what

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,359
makes it different people might say it's

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,279
brown but

17
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,039
noticing the brown is kind of located in

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,879
a certain region so being a little bit

19
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,960
more specific and

20
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,039
looking at seeing what that tells us

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,039
this all goes back to being able to

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,479
problem solve being able to take a

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,559
situation and

24
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,799
figure it out even if it takes a couple

25
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,599
tries now while there's many educational

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,399
resources

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
available hoping that you choose wisely

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,480
and

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,079
found this channel and continue to look

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,878
at some of the other videos here on

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,119
debaco

32
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,640
university now what makes tobacco

33
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,280
university so great is

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,920
anytime anywhere you can access it

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,599
breakfast

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,320
dinner snack time nighttime daytime it

37
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,679
doesn't matter it's accessible for you

38
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,199
and when you're watching some of the

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,560
content you always want to ask yourself

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,478
how can i apply what i have

41
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,600
learned i can teach how all the pieces

42
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,959
of chess move but

43
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,640
how do they interact and how can you

44
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,239
put a game together and that's what this

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,519
is looking forward to

46
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,438
producing as i said this is less of a

47
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,078
concern of the actual process that you

48
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,000
go through

49
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,118
we have to watch videos once or twice or

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,478
look at subtitles

51
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,719
i'm more concerned with the final

52
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,920
product to kind of grade the ability the

53
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,879
problem solving to work with the

54
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,239
information

55
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,519
not necessarily how you go about

56
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,719
learning the information at least

57
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,798
initially

58
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,798
this working with the information is

59
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,640
great for long-term memory retention and

60
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,280
that's kind of the intention and goal

61
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,040
here

62
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
is to be able to not just remember for

63
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,200
the test but remember for the

64
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,560
longer term some of the topics that

65
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,680
we're going to be going over

66
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
in biology are kind of broken apart by

67
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
quarter here

68
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,920
we have everything from biology

69
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,959
fundamentals to kind of cells

70
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,120
in dna and then we get into kind of

71
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,800
a progression of evolution plants and

72
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,840
animals and lastly we

73
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,520
end with body systems so hopefully you

74
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,520
have a lot of learning to come in the

75
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:35,930
future

76
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:35,930
