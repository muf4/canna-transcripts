1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
this is intended to be a short

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,289
comparison between natural selection and

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,650
genetic engineering so natural selection

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,730
here we have our two moths and

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:15,179
engineering we're modifying the genes of

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,859
an organism so start off here natural

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,809
selection over time selecting from one

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,420
particular trait typically based on the

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:24,118
phenotype so here we have the birds

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,179
eating the green bugs here that stand

11
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,670
out against the brown tree the brown

12
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,439
bugs are able to survive and they're the

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,940
ones that are gonna pass on the genes

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,369
there and there are more or less

15
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,379
surviving through the process of natural

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:41,729
selection they're naturally being

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,460
selected for another example here pretty

18
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:46,259
complex but over time selecting for one

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,530
particular trait again typically based

20
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:52,079
on phenotype modern corn comes from

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,859
something called teosinte teosinte here

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,320
we see compared to 1/4 I save corn plant

23
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:01,738
but it is a highly branched corn plant

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,579
that produces very small almost single

25
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:08,158
you know rose seed ears through the

26
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:11,158
process of natural selection people have

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,909
cultivated corn to grow one main central

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,170
stock and produce large ears of corn you

29
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,118
can see here the comparison of our

30
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,859
modern corn versus our teosinte the

31
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:24,509
ancestor of corn this was through

32
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,090
cultivation and through being able to

33
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,909
feed people and being more efficient at

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,500
food production the modern corn

35
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,969
essentially was developed we've then

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,859
gone to the next step in genetically

37
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:37,048
engineered it which is the corn in

38
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,930
general that we're modifying is the

39
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,570
result of many many generations of

40
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,340
natural selection

41
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:46,529
specifically genetic engineering it's a

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,719
deliberate modification of an organism

43
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,290
by manipulating the genetic material

44
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,259
based on the genotype of an organism so

45
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,149
since all the genes in DNA is a you know

46
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,670
a universal code we're able to take

47
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,899
those genes and modify them here we're

48
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,939
taking the genes for a red pigment

49
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,460
pigment we can make bacterial bananas

50
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:08,399
clovers and frogs all red by simply

51
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,618
inserting the red pigment gene here's

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,449
the mice with glowing eyes were

53
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,469
genetically modifying this particular

54
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:15,479
mice

55
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,219
want to see what one looks like kind of

56
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,609
in real life we have a green glowing

57
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,689
mouse a YouTube video link provided here

58
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,030
hopefully this clarifies a little bit

59
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:27,060
about natural selection versus genetic

60
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,300
engineering and what each individually

61
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,300
does
