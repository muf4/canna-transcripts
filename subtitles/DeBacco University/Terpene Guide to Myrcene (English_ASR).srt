1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,439
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,359
we're going to go

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,359
over the terpene mercy

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,759
[Music]

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,199
all right welcome to the chirping guide

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,278
to mercene

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,760
well what's the scent location and

8
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,600
properties of this particular terpene

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,359
well mercedes a monoterpene found in the

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,760
most abundant terpene in

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,640
cannabis that's kind of interesting the

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,160
scent is earthy sweet and musky

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,079
and foods that you might be familiar

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,319
with that containing of course

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,399
occurs in more than just cannabis plants

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,200
mango hops lemongrass thyme

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,359
wild melon as well as that lemongrass

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,879
has that kind of mercene

19
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,558
concentration which you might be

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,558
familiar with some of these sweet

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,839
earthy musky smells you might be very

22
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,839
familiar with

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,320
so what are some of the benefits of

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,840
mercin is that it does have

25
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,198
anti-inflammatory and anti-immunogenic

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,280
which inhibits

27
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,280
cell mutation including cancer cell

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,079
properties so kind of important for

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,198
reducing

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,680
inflammation as well as a potential uh

31
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,039
chance at reducing cells from mutating

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,000
which could be

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,520
related to cancer research going forward

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
does suppress muscle spasms

35
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,640
sleep aid and also has antibacterial

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,920
properties as well

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,239
studies show that mercy may take thc

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,680
more effective which is why it said that

39
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,879
consuming fresh mango

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,640
or other fruits that are high in

41
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,239
concentrations of immersing prior to

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,159
consuming cannabis will increase the

43
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,759
effects of the cannabinoids so we have

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,040
that chance that this might be having

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,719
that effect

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
additive effect with some other

47
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,158
cannabinoids

48
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,519
now going through information this is

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,359
one thing i did find i did

50
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,039
cite the source uh down here is that

51
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,519
there's inaccurate information i've read

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,759
about

53
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,879
mercenaries raising is important as they

54
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,040
state because

55
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,640
presence determines whether the strain

56
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,079
is indica or sativa

57
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,439
and that is not true they're looking

58
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,839
at indi um classifying indica

59
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,199
or sativa based on the effects so

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
they're saying anything with less than

61
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,560
0.5

62
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,960
mercy and produces sativa-like effects

63
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,519
so

64
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,318
keep in mind that sativa and indica the

65
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,639
only true

66
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,759
indication of sativa versus indica is

67
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,079
the morphology

68
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,840
or how the plant actually looks it has

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
nothing to do with indica-like effects

70
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
sativa-like effects

71
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,759
indica sativa is really only referring

72
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,599
to the morphology of how the plant looks

73
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,199
is it tall with thin leaves or is it

74
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,839
shorter with wider leaves

75
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,878
that's a that's an indica versus sativa

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
comparison

77
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,919
not these uh kind of made up effects

78
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
because

79
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,119
different terpene concentrations

80
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,160
cannabinoid concentrations

81
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,759
can change the chemical profile which

82
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,560
can change some of the properties and

83
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,199
effects

84
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,719
of the plant indica sativa not directly

85
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,479
correlated it's an old myth that goes

86
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,400
way back

87
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,159
so if you're looking for some strains to

88
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
kind of look at that might be high in

89
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,079
mercy now here's kind of a little bit of

90
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,719
a list here here's also a great summary

91
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
slide

92
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,120
to provide you some more information

93
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,119
about the terpene

94
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,120
mercy
