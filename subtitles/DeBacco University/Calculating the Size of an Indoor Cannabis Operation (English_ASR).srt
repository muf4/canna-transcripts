1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
in this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,318
going to go over calculating the size of

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,480
an

4
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,839
indoor cannabis operation and give you

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,679
some numbers to kind of look at and

6
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,599
compare maybe to your own operation

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,359
if you're looking designing one from

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,920
scratch some ideas

9
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,919
to take into consideration

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,839
all right let's sharpen those pencils

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
let's go to calculating the size of an

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,000
indoor row operation

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,278
so first off when we're calculating size

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,799
here

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,960
it's important to know how many

16
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,879
full-sized plants you can take care of

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,558
just because you can fit them in an area

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,399
particularly for a grow room

19
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,159
if you can't take care of them there

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,920
will be an overall loss you want to

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,279
factor in also have an idea what your

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,120
labor may be

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,879
however size available and limiting

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,799
amount of light coverage are all factors

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:51,599
into potential size of an indoor

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,679
operation

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,760
and i'll go over some of the specifics

28
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,960
to lighting in particular at the very

29
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,640
end here

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,600
so square foot recommendations and i

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,600
stress these are just general

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
recommendations good starting points

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,799
depending on the plant morphology of

34
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,359
your chosen cannabis strain this will

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
impact the overall size of each plant

36
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,478
also your pruning method will also have

37
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,478
a great impact

38
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,159
note that sea of green will have the

39
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,438
most plants per square foot due to the

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,080
short veg cycle

41
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,359
however in general for full-sized uh

42
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,280
flowering plants

43
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,840
one plant per five square feet or two

44
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
plants per square meter is the typical

45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,600
kind of general starting point for a

46
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,879
recommendation

47
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,039
now we're looking at plants per 10

48
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,438
square feet or that one square meter

49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,920
per growth stage so while i quoted two

50
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,438
plants that beats for the flowering room

51
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,118
if you're looking at propagation in that

52
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,319
same 10 square feet of square meter you

53
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,000
can get over potentially over 150 plants

54
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,078
for a vegetative room you want to

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,118
decrease from 150 all the way down to

56
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,398
about three

57
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,078
and when you make that final change that

58
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
flower room that's where you'd be

59
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,839
utilizing those two plants

60
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,360
per square meter or per 10 square feet

61
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,880
depending what system you're using for

62
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,040
measurement

63
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,718
now these also other limitations to

64
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
consider as i said the labor

65
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,759
just because you can fit them all there

66
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,158
can you take care of them all

67
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,519
do you have the time to dedicate to all

68
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,679
those plants are going to need

69
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,959
throughout their entire grow cycle and

70
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,199
then there's the lighting

71
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,719
that i'll mention in the next slide and

72
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,000
also the circuits just because you can

73
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,239
put 10 lights

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,199
does your electrical system support or

75
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,878
can it support

76
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,958
10 lights that you're choosing to

77
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,318
utilize in that area

78
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,159
now i said the lights tend to be the

79
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,598
most limiting so i want to give you just

80
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,280
some general

81
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,679
ideas as far as what lighting should be

82
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,519
used for what so as general rules

83
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,200
if you have a thousand watt hps or high

84
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,719
pressure sodium that we can see right

85
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,199
here about a

86
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,080
five by five foot for flowering plant or

87
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,359
a six by

88
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
six square foot area for a veg plant

89
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,959
this is where we're measuring out those

90
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,000
areas 600 watt

91
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,360
hps we see the measurements there cmh

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,598
ceramic metal halide you can see that

93
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,280
very similar to the high pressure sodium

94
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:01,359
as far as square footage

95
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,199
the 615 cmh goes down a four by four

96
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,120
feet for veg and only three by three for

97
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,719
flowers so keep that in mind

98
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,959
a 650 watt led uh kind of similar

99
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,479
to that thousand watt uh hps but be

100
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,640
mindful it's because these are just

101
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,318
meant to be general recommendations you

102
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,759
may not be getting the same

103
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,158
potential output as you would with a

104
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,598
thousand watt there unless you have 420

105
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,158
led you can see the

106
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,318
listed out here this is also going to

107
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,959
impact when we talk about electricity

108
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,439
the amount of cooling that you may need

109
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,640
because if you are using kind of the hps

110
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,359
they will generate a little bit more

111
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,839
heat

112
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,920
than say an led light led lights still

113
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,400
generate heat but just not quite as much

114
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,359
so also take that into factor and

115
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,959
consideration

116
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,879
on how you might be moving plants from

117
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,319
potentially one type of light to another

118
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,560
throughout their growth cycle

119
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,399
and how that will impact things so yes

120
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,759
there are a lot of variables but

121
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
it's important to understand some of

122
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,239
those before you go out and start

123
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,399
purchasing anything

124
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,759
so you can make educated decisions and

125
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,319
have to rebuy things

126
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,519
and help increase the odds of success of

127
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,518
your growing operation
