00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,160
going over the fire triangle

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,160
which involves what it takes for a fire

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,320
to get started with all the requirements

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,919
for it to get started and to keep it

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,559
going it's called a triangle here

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,279
because you need

8
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,399
all three sides in order to keep that

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,480
fire going

10
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,159
so looking here that general fire

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,880
triangle what is it composed

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,760
of well we have fuel we have oxygen and

13
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,599
we have heat

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,599
and when those all come together you'll

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,399
have fire these three components are

16
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,879
needed for

17
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,640
fire to occur so you need a fuel source

18
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,280
you need the presence of oxygen

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,160
you also need heat all present together

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,160
any one of those

21
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,558
aren't present the triangle falls apart

22
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,398
and the fire will be extinguished

23
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,718
so that fuel source so again it can be

24
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,120
quite variable as far as a fuel source

25
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,000
but fuel is defined as a combustible

26
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,759
material

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,119
material can be in any state of matter

28
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,280
could be solid liquid or gas

29
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,119
most solids and liquids become vaporized

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,198
before they will burn

31
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,238
for example clothing plant material

32
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:59,920
flammable liquids

33
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,159
all can be considered fuel if you have a

34
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,478
wood burning stove you have propane

35
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,198
uh gasoline for your car ethanol or

36
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,679
diesel

37
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,840
even clothing these all can be examples

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
of fuel sources

39
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
then it comes to oxygen so fire requires

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,079
at least

41
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,799
16 oxygen in the air atmospheric oxygen

42
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,719
levels are

43
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,240
21 so just because a couple oxygen atoms

44
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,560
are present it's not enough you need to

45
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,039
have about that 16 percent of oxygen

46
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,960
in the air keep in mind again normal

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
breathing oxygen is only about 21

48
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,759
oxygen but so we can have levels below

49
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,320
that in order to keep a fire going

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,118
then we have our heat source so heat

51
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,798
will

52
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,239
rise the temperature of the fuel source

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,399
to the point of ignition

54
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,078
then depending on the exact actual fuel

55
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,640
source could depend on the amount of

56
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,599
heat

57
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,079
that might be needed to keep that going

58
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,640
and then

59
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,158
lastly that triangle that triangle the

60
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
reason why it's kind of that good visual

61
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,399
there

62
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,920
is all three components must be present

63
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,960
at the same time in space for

64
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,680
fire to result removal of any uh and

65
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,078
breaking

66
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,439
the triangle therefore there will be no

67
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,519
fire so this is important we're looking

68
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,599
at extinguishing or putting out a fire

69
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,439
knocking any one of those three sides of

70
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,478
the triangle out will cause the fire to

71
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,239
be extinguished

72
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,640
but also if we're noticing evidence that

73
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,920
there was a fire we can assume that all

74
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,159
three of these components

75
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,679
were there to some degree in order to

76
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,680
keep that fire burning
