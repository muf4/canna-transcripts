1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,520
all right here in this video on debacle

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,080
university we're looking at

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,878
fire investigation go over some of the

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,359
basics

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,518
and also some of the goals of

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,959
investigating what may have happened

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,160
when we have a fire that occurred

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,160
so first off that invests those

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,278
investigation basics well workflow

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,960
should start

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,480
from minimally damaged areas and

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,080
progress to ones with greater

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,320
damage those kind of fringe areas and

14
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,079
working closer to where the potential

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
source may have been

16
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,358
investigators should use typical forms

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,280
of forensic

18
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,800
documentation and collect evidence as

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,719
they're going through in doing this

20
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,000
in this documentation can include notes

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,480
and photographs

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
the evidence collected typically is

23
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,479
evidence of potential accelerant

24
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,839
samples fire items and other evidence

25
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,759
that may not be directly

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,160
fire related but can help in that

27
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,839
investigation process

28
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,759
the goal of this investigation is to try

29
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,559
to determine the point of origin

30
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,280
the heat source or sources and also a

31
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,640
possible

32
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,239
reason so that point of origin well

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,558
that's basically where did the fire

34
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,759
originate from burn patterns are used to

35
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,599
help answer this question

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,439
in addition to the area of the most

37
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,798
damage is commonly where the fire

38
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,239
started because it simply had the

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,760
longest burn time

40
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,920
the point of origin can be used to help

41
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,520
determine the cause of the fire as well

42
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,439
this is why this is one of the goals of

43
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,599
the investigation process

44
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,599
they also have char patterns so char

45
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,438
patterns are created by very hot fires

46
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,640
that burn very quickly that move fast

47
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,319
along a path

48
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,759
this can result in sharp lines between

49
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,158
burned and not burned

50
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,879
material door char patterns can help

51
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,880
determine

52
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,239
what side of the door the fire was on

53
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,319
and floor chart patterns can help

54
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,039
determine if an accilent was used in its

55
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,679
path

56
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,159
we see the example here of a char

57
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,240
pattern from about one liter of gasoline

58
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,079
on the area that that can create

59
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,319
just to give a general idea of what a

60
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,319
char pattern would look like

61
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,639
there's something called v patterns and

62
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,478
as the fire burns up as we see it

63
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,759
actively burning on this image here on

64
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,078
the side of the building

65
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,680
it burns in a vertical v-shaped pattern

66
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,438
so a fire that starts at an

67
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
outlet against a wall leaves a char

68
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,559
pattern that points to the or point of

69
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,479
origin

70
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,239
now a narrow v-shaped patterns typically

71
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
indicate a very hot fire that could have

72
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,319
an accelerant added to it

73
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,439
a wide v-shaped pattern so just a slow

74
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,359
burning fire

75
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,639
and if there's kind of a u-shape to it

76
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,480
this indicates a

77
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,079
pool of origin not really a point of

78
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,840
origin such as a puddle

79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,280
of gasoline you kind of get that area

80
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,400
where it's kind of progressing

81
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,120
not that distinctive v-shape

82
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,319
now when we're looking at an area of

83
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,719
post-burning we could

84
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,079
notice the potential for heat shadows

85
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,239
and what a heat shadow

86
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,400
is is it simply occurs when an object

87
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,920
shields another which can help determine

88
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,039
the point of origin

89
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,679
a room a desk could shield a wall here

90
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,280
we see an

91
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,000
evidence of where a person may have been

92
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,479
laying we see evidence of their legs

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,560
torso their arm and their head region

94
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,439
and kind of the heat shadow that is left

95
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,000
behind

96
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,120
uh due to the result of the body

97
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
physically blocking

98
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,878
some of that fire from progressing to

99
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,280
certain areas

100
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,560
looking at glass if there's glass in a

101
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,560
particular

102
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,158
situation this is great for the fire

103
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
investigation process

104
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,560
as we see here a light bulb this can

105
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,079
help indicate the fire's direction as

106
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,719
they tend to melt towards the heat

107
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
source

108
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,479
so in this case of the heeple the light

109
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,640
bulb up here where the heat source is

110
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,199
basically came from this region over

111
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,639
here this indicates the bulb was pulled

112
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,639
showing that the heat came from the

113
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,399
right of this image

114
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,919
windows can also be another source as

115
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,560
they can help determine how the fire

116
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,238
burned

117
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,158
there's presence of like a really dark

118
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
layer on the glass this could

119
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,000
indicate a slow smoldering fire

120
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,640
and clear glass with an abnormal pattern

121
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,280
of cracking could apply a very hot fire

122
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,158
it could be possibly due to the use or

123
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,199
inclusion

124
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,959
of an accelerant in that process we also

125
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,798
have something called the chimney effect

126
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,158
and if you've got regular fireplace in a

127
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,799
chimney it

128
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,079
operates along those same terms so that

129
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,599
chimney effect is simply when the fire

130
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,360
ignites at a point and

131
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,359
superheated gas is raised upward in a

132
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,120
giant fireball so a typical chimney

133
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,519
you're mostly going to have

134
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
the smoke and the gases kind of extend

135
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,759
out the flute of the chimney

136
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,359
here we're having a fireball effect a

137
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,039
fireball will continue to burn straight

138
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,199
up and burn a hole in the ceiling

139
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,639
potentially if it's present in the area

140
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,199
which can help determine again the

141
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,840
origin of the fire which can be directly

142
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,600
underneath

143
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,000
this area so it kind of potentially

144
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
allows for a pinpoint of an area

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,478
so that chimney effect can occur more

146
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,399
than just so and only just a chimney

147
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,279
but it can help determine again that

148
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,638
important point of origin

149
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,159
keep in mind if you're looking at an

150
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,560
actively burning fire if someone was

151
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,600
able to capture a picture of the fire

152
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,160
the color that you see can help provide

153
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,759
some clues for example the smoke color

154
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,560
this indicates potentially the type of

155
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,080
material

156
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,879
burning if you're looking to make a

157
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,959
signal fire you want to use like

158
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,600
typically your conifers that are fresh

159
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,159
and green they'll produce a lot of smoke

160
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,199
to that fire where most of the time

161
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
you're looking if you're burning in a

162
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,400
wood stove you want to let your

163
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,918
wood cure for a period of time for

164
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,599
example your oaks and your maples this

165
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,159
will create a much cleaner

166
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,680
almost no smoke coloration also the

167
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,280
flame color indicates the fire

168
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,639
temperatures we see here with the little

169
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,038
candle flame

170
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,319
the blue zone being about 800 degrees

171
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,240
celsius here

172
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,000
and then we could see upwards at the top

173
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,840
here much hotter

174
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,720
potentially 1200 degrees celsius to 1400

175
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,279
degrees celsius

176
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,880
in this upper portion so again looking

177
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,879
at that kind of coloration

178
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,879
that we see of the flame color can help

179
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,079
provide a general indication of how

180
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,639
hot that fire is burning then we also

181
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,800
have

182
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
fire patterns and this image shows an

183
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,720
ignitable liquid pore pattern

184
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,319
so it's a pore pattern if you look at

185
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,199
the image here like a spilled

186
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,519
container of milk it's simply indicating

187
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,600
that

188
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,879
area where the accelerant may be where

189
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,199
the ignitable liquid

190
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,159
may be located we can kind of see this

191
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,360
evidence of our

192
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,360
hard edge we see our unburned areas

193
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,400
so taking this apart you know really

194
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,080
looking at

195
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,239
potentially not just oh is it burned in

196
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,478
an unburned area looking at the

197
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,160
medium burn the heavy burn the hard edge

198
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,120
this can tell an investigator

199
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,560
a lot about what it would occurred as

200
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
the fire was going on
