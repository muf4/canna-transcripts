1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
here we're gonna look at lien neat in

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,179
the acquired branches of the immune

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,370
system now you might be wondering why I

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,649
chose to include these pictures here on

5
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:12,509
the title slide well included the bird's

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,919
nests is kind of to address the word

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,350
innate Birds

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,028
um hatch out of eggs they come out of

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,830
the nest and they fly away I never

10
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:22,679
taught how to make a nest they have the

11
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:26,098
innate ability to make an S versus

12
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,109
acquiring being able to acquire and

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,240
build something such as engineers here

14
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,130
have to acquire materials and draw it

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,289
out and learn out of different symbols

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,620
to use and all this relates to the

17
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,600
immune system and you'll see how so the

18
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,280
innate versus the acquired immune system

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,620
there's two key differences in the

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,200
components so we see here some of the

21
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:49,259
macrophages the dendritic cells it's in

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,199
a fills all are part of the innate

23
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,849
immune system the adaptive which is also

24
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,460
called the acquired immune system

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,710
involved mainly b-cells and t-cells in

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,980
the production of antibodies cd4 t-cells

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,439
and cd8 t-cells to kind of put that into

28
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,868
a flowchart our innate swear immune

29
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,509
system acquired in an eight-hour innate

30
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:11,969
hears blood-borne kind of phagocytes

31
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,670
such as her neutrophils macrophages or

32
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,859
basophils natural killer cells as semo

33
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,560
fills all those are under the innate

34
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,509
physical barriers are also included

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,879
under the innate immune system those

36
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,450
include our skin or mucous membranes so

37
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,519
IVA steers stomach acid all those listed

38
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,159
under the innate now the acquired is

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,688
those T in these cells we have some

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,570
helper T cells from suppressor T cells

41
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,578
antibodies under the Morel immunity

42
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,199
through the B cells these are much more

43
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:43,408
specific it needs have to be acquired

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,540
over time this is where our body starts

45
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,310
to develop antibodies and help to

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,950
remember and carry over some information

47
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,350
from an initial exposure in case that

48
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,820
was to show up again putting this in

49
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:55,589
more of a pictorial form with comparing

50
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,109
the innate to be acquired the innate is

51
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,420
nonspecific beauty you were born with

52
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,950
its fast-acting occurred within a few

53
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,170
hours as we see here at the time table

54
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,689
down here it includes physical barriers

55
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,039
as well as chemical and immune cells so

56
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:11,370
some of those physical barriers include

57
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,109
skin hair cilia mucus that just have

58
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,840
enzymes these stomach acid

59
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,180
some internal defenses can be compliment

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,670
proteins phagocytic cells and natural

61
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,860
killer cells these are not specific but

62
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,619
very quick acting these might be kind of

63
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,620
the first ones on sight to a potential

64
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,930
source of infection and all of these you

65
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,849
are basically born with getting more

66
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,420
specific are acquired or adaptive

67
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,819
immunity

68
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,399
this is antigen specific this is more

69
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,539
complex however it has a lag time you

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,060
know start time table down here is not

71
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,280
ours but days now because it requires

72
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,680
time to process and recognize about

73
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,990
potential invaders it includes a memory

74
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,730
for future infections which is great and

75
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,640
always in part what makes vaccines

76
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:56,340
effective the adaptive immune system as

77
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,549
antibodies cell mediated immune response

78
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,039
in memory response both of these are

79
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,230
very important components of the immune

80
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:08,479
system some you're born with and some

81
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,479
you acquire and build up over time
