welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,878
it's a student series where we'll learn

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,119
about ratchet light hanging 101 for

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,039
lighting just a quick note keep in mind

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,798
that these are sold in pairs and the

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,199
weight that they can support is for the

7
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,358
pair not the individual

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,839
hanger so with that let's get into the

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,560
video as part of this debaco university

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,559
student series

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,759
[Music]

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,920
this is our ratchet strap 101 for

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,160
lighting so this is a pretty basic

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,559
ratchet strap they don't differ too much

15
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,199
as you can see pretty similar this one

16
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,599
however you pull up on this little lever

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,760
and you could adjust it accordingly

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,960
you would hang it up by this clip onto

19
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,878
whatever

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,239
structure you have available ready to

21
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,640
hang your lights

22
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,198
for this one it's a little different but

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,679
simpler where you just press this button

24
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,839
and adjust accordingly

25
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,600
based to what you need now when it comes

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,039
to actually adjusting the light you're

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,680
going to want to make sure that you have

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,320
a hand to support it underneath this is

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,960
the most important step because if you

30
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,879
are to start adjusting this while it's

31
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,879
supporting this heavy light it could

32
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,560
fall and ruin your entire operation it

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,319
could break your lights or your plants

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,799
so you just want to make sure if you're

35
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,118
going to do any adjusting to these that

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,200
you have a good support underneath

37
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,200
now the good thing about

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,159
ratchet straps is that they're

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,478
adjustable they're versatile so when you

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,400
have an issue like this where a hanger

41
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,078
isn't big enough like this one it

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,240
doesn't matter because you can level it

43
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,239
out accordingly

44
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,519
you
