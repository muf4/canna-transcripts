1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,169
okay here well the basic overview of

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,330
thermodynamics this picture gives you a

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:09,150
real quick summary or having a system

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:13,080
and its surroundings which are separated

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,599
by a boundary little more specifically

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,000
here the definition is the study of the

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,920
flow and transformation of energy in the

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,079
universe

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,420
thermodynamics directly translates to

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,389
heat changes it's only concerned with

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,630
large-scale observations let's look at

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,189
an example so the first law of

13
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,829
thermodynamics it's the law of

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,609
conservation of energy say set energy

15
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,489
can be converted but not created nor

16
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:43,979
destroyed an example that be here we

17
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:46,109
have our food energy here right energy

18
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,869
stored in the food and our chemical

19
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,750
energy that we eat is converted or

20
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:55,288
transformed into mechanical energy when

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:59,219
we run since energy cannot be created or

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:02,370
destroyed it can only be converted the

23
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,609
total energy before in the food items is

24
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:07,739
equal to the total energy after even

25
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:11,599
though a transformation occurred this is

26
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:14,519
the first law of thermodynamics the

27
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:17,669
second law of thermodynamics says that

28
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:21,090
energy cannot be converted without the

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,189
loss of usable energy energy lost I put

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,950
that in quotes here is converted to

31
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:29,548
thermal energy so we see our energy

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,368
before and this kind of box here and our

33
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,890
usable energy after is a smaller portion

34
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:37,500
even though if we add up the usable

35
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,530
energy after in the unusable energy

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,109
after we get the same amount it was this

37
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,780
unusable energy well this unusable

38
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:46,950
Energy's can be that thermal energy so

39
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,868
if we take a ball we balance it in the

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,609
same area again and again again it'll

41
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:52,049
actually be warmed the area where it

42
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:54,209
keeps bouncing will be warm there's a

43
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,299
transfer of thermal energy that energy

44
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:59,658
is what we call lost in the sense that

45
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,460
were not able ourselves to use it

46
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:06,210
however we still account for that energy

47
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:09,810
and it's still accounted for so the

48
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:12,810
total energy before is the same as the

49
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,689
energy after however we have to account

50
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,310
for some

51
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:18,159
that other energy that is considered

52
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,949
unusable and that typically is lost in

53
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,419
the form of heat even though we add up

54
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:24,579
that heat energy plus our usable energy

55
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,909
we will get the same amount whose again

56
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,990
we cannot create or destroy energy

57
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,500
hopefully it's a good quick overview of

58
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,500
thermodynamics
