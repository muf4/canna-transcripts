1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,580
okay this videos will look at skin

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,588
injury and repair and below in the

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,809
description you'll see some links to

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,420
some sources where I pull some of the

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,339
images from some great other slideshows

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,368
to take a look at I'm gonna warn you the

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,800
next slide here is gonna show some burn

8
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,629
injuries so some of the images may be

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,589
considered graphic so viewer discretion

10
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:25,288
is advised

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:28,410
so getting to that skin injury looking

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,970
at burns classified by severity so

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,308
first-degree burns only the upper

14
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:34,920
epidermis is damaged it's kind of like a

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,109
sunburn here second-degree burns are

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,989
upper part of the dermis is also damaged

17
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,570
blisters can appear skimming the heels a

18
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,878
little scarring third-degree burns are

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,100
more severe and they consume the

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,439
thickness of the skin burn area appears

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,719
white red or black and you see a sadly

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,579
on this person's foot there's also

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,520
fourth degree burns which I chose not to

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,340
show this gives you an idea of first

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,989
being the most mild seconding in the

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,750
middle and third being the most severe

27
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:05,908
in this case so how's this skin go about

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,950
repairing itself when we have our in

29
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,260
injury we look at a cut injury because

30
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,689
that's probably more common should I get

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,549
unsteadily more often I'd like to admit

32
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:16,618
so bleeding occurs at the site of injury

33
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,909
immediately after the injury the mass

34
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,859
cells in the region trigger an

35
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,049
inflammatory response so that's our

36
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,079
first part here see this cut was pretty

37
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,060
down deep into the dermal layer so we

38
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,390
got bleeding the current and have things

39
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,740
rushing to this site so administer might

40
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,250
put advantage over just trying to stop

41
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,649
the bleeding

42
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,868
after several hours the scab should

43
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,359
begin to form and these are cells

44
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:41,728
migrating to the edges of the wound and

45
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,228
it effects a tonic cells that remove

46
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,509
debris want to clean this up because we

47
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,429
have an injury now bacteria could get in

48
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,560
here what happened they were cleaning up

49
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,118
this debris more cells arriving with

50
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,490
enhanced circulation to the area to why

51
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,688
it may feel warm and get red because you

52
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,908
have more blood going to that area

53
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,008
clotting around the edges in the

54
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,990
affected area partially isolates the

55
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,390
region so the body wants to kind of

56
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:04,828
eliminate bacteria from getting into the

57
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,899
body because there's a wound site here

58
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:08,419
it's gonna folks establish I'm just

59
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,520
going to have a seal the region off

60
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,079
increase blood flow to allow exchange of

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
things a lot of things being brought

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,870
there

63
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,179
try to isolate this region at least a

64
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,939
little bit to try to limit the potential

65
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,250
for damage moving on after about a week

66
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,050
of the injury the scab has been

67
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,379
undermined by epithelial cells you can

68
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,780
see here and we're migrating over this

69
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:34,049
mesh work produced by the fibroblast

70
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,050
activity this notice that the scab is

71
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,280
still located at the surface

72
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,070
photosynthetic activity around the site

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,000
is almost ended and fibrin clot is being

74
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,859
disintegrated

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,139
so we're noticing this transition I

76
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,060
mentioned that the scab is still present

77
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:49,529
at the top here so even though you may

78
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,390
not think things are going on there's a

79
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,340
lot going on below in that dermal layer

80
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:56,099
this is why if you pick at a scab and

81
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,469
remove this kind of recalling some

82
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,389
injury site here and you're not allowing

83
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:03,989
the wound to have a sealed environment

84
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:05,669
and as a result that curtain could cause

85
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:07,620
a longer wound healing time if you

86
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,179
remove this scab we want to let it

87
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,939
naturally kind of fall off because your

88
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,170
body is working from the deeper dermal

89
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,879
layer up through the dermal layer to the

90
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,309
surface here so it's starting deep in

91
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,049
the dermal layer and working its way up

92
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,759
after several weeks again this is a more

93
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,040
severe cut the scab has been shed

94
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,298
removes could Falls up naturally you

95
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,359
notice it kind of gets itchy kind of

96
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,010
your body trying it to remove it and the

97
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,840
epidermis is complete a shallow

98
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:36,239
depression though marks the injury site

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,979
cyber blast here and the dermal

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,860
continued to create scar tissue that

101
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:43,289
will gradually elevate the overlaying

102
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,570
epidermis so there is still may be scar

103
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,939
tissue present and left over a long

104
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,979
period of time but we're noticing that

105
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,379
for the most part function is returned

106
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,298
normally to the skin in the dermal

107
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,789
region here it's now alpha using that

108
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,700
sealed barrier canteen yuan even though

109
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:01,078
there may still be that mark left so

110
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,030
keep this in mind when you get a cup

111
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,299
don't want to pick up your scabs let it

112
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,370
kind of naturally fall off to allow the

113
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,370
body time to be to go through this

114
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:14,299
stepwise process to heal itself for a

115
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,299
long-term repair
