1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,720
in the artificial lighting market led

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,160
lighting is getting a lot of popularity

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,400
so we're going to go through some of the

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:17,920
options related to cannabis production

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:17,920
here on tobacco university

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,880
all right let's get into some of the led

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,799
lighting options for cannabis production

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,079
so first off led light is a high powered

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,920
light emitting diode

10
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,278
this kind of shows the kind of the inter

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,039
mechanics of

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,799
what is involved in those little tiny

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,920
diodes not going to spend a ton of time

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,320
on the mechanics

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,280
but realize that there is a lot going on

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,840
in each of those little led chips there

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
so led color mixing so to get certain

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,800
colors

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,160
types of white leds are produced with

20
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,238
the

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,919
red green and blue color mixing so you

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,519
get a lot of kind of mixture of those

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,679
colors this is how they're able to get

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,239
kind of that pure kind of white light

25
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,600
by mixing the leds that they're adding

26
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,358
to get that color mixing

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,039
to get potentially certain wavelengths

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,239
or a combination of wavelengths

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,840
for those plants to be exposed to now

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,159
the advantages here

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,680
so led advantages on plant growth and

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,040
development compared to conventional

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,760
lighting sources

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,439
so for some lights growers can select

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,200
specific wavelengths for customized

36
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,039
plant growth and development

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,960
the versatile control of the flux

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,200
emissions and light spectrum

39
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,039
high luminous efficiency small size and

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,478
directional light emissions down towards

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,560
the plants which is great

42
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,840
they have a long life expectancy

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,320
essentially up to 50

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,478
000 plus hours reduced heat emissions

45
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,959
but that does not mean no heat emissions

46
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,478
it does not get dim with age economical

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,478
in terms of space and power at least for

48
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,319
wattage requirements more robust

49
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,239
structures and easier to handle

50
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,679
and easy to dispose of without any

51
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,798
environmental hazards

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,640
that might be contaminants in other bulb

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
or lighting options

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,320
so with this it sounds like almost too

55
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,078
good to be true it's just a win-win

56
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,559
however features to look for when we're

57
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,559
looking specifically at led lights

58
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
you want an led light that does not have

59
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,200
fans to help cool it

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,439
fans have a tendency to fail sooner than

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,280
the actual bulbs or diodes will

62
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,878
so if the fans start to fail it'll

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
overheat and potentially

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,120
damage your lighting structure also full

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,719
spectrum you want to go beyond the just

66
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,080
the par reading as we can see here to be

67
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,598
a full spectrum light

68
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,840
if they're dimmable that's another great

69
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,439
option particular ceiling height limited

70
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,959
light intensity that matches the

71
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,000
environment so if you're enriching with

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,680
carbon dioxide

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
higher light outputs can be utilized by

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,000
the plants compared to non-enriched

75
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,440
environments

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
so make sure you're getting the proper

77
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,719
fixture that matches your growing

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,400
conditions

79
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,639
now there's the great debate between the

80
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
high par and the full spectrum led

81
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,799
lights

82
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,719
the high park look like this and the

83
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
full spectrum look like this hyper is

84
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,680
that kind of purpley light

85
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
the pros is that they're very efficient

86
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,640
at producing high par values

87
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,280
however the cons are they're hard to

88
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,878
diagnose plant abnormalities

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,598
in general i would not recommend the

90
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,318
high par lights simply because

91
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,839
plant production can utilize more than

92
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,679
only the par spectrum

93
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,759
and potential plant issues can easily be

94
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,319
missed so not only is it harder for the

95
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,079
grower

96
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,079
to identify potential issues with their

97
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,000
plants plant services for learning more

98
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,519
about them particularly cannabis plants

99
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
might be able to utilize more than just

100
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,640
the par reading

101
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,800
so yes it's great and plants can be

102
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,559
grown well with these lights but really

103
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
i'd recommend more the full spectrum

104
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,039
lights

105
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,878
produces wavelengths outside of just the

106
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,560
par spectrum which canvas plants can

107
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,439
utilize and potentially can get better

108
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
yield

109
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,280
a better quality as well however they

110
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,878
can be more expensive

111
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,318
but they're highly recommended for plant

112
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,158
production in general especially

113
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:34,958
cannabis that has high light intensity

114
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,280
demands

115
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,239
and growers are also interested in plant

116
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,840
compounds

117
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,000
not to mention the added benefit of

118
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,680
being able to diagnose potential disease

119
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,239
or nutrient deficiencies very early on

120
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,120
lastly just looking at one example here

121
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,640
of

122
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,000
one of these led lights the gavita pro

123
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,359
1700e led just to give you kind of an

124
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,878
example of one

125
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,799
and kind of what they may look like and

126
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,000
they come in very different forms i like

127
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
this one because it simply gives you

128
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,759
that nice little chart there to see as

129
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,000
well what it's producing

130
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,120
and they can reduce the hvac needs

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,919
because they're not producing as much

132
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
heat

133
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,518
they have a nice even design here very

134
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,360
spread out amount of light

135
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,959
so again a lot of advantages but again

136
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,120
this is just one comparison i'll do

137
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,600
another video on exactly comparing

138
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,399
some specific brands of led lights here

139
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
on tobacco

140
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,159
