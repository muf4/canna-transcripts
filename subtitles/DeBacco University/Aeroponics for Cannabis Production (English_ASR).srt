1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
if you're interested in learning about

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,599
aeroponics

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:16,079
this debaco university video will help

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:17,600
you understand aeroponics in more detail

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,278
all right let's look at aeroponics for

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
cannabis production

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,800
well starting off with the basics of

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,118
aeroponics

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,640
and aeroponics basics are the plants are

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,960
grown while suspended in

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,960
air with water and nutrients splashed or

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
misted onto their roots

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
this system uses minimal water and

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,120
nutrients if done correctly

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,280
with no reduction in plant performance

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,280
now while there are commercial systems

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,320
this kind of shows kind of a dyi kind of

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,320
version here of

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,238
what a grower kind of constructed to

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,039
create this aeroponic system

21
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,599
just to show you how simple it can be

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,280
there's

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
now we're looking at the general system

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
again there's many different types

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
all with the same premise aeroponics

26
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,159
involves a reservoir with a nutrient

27
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,399
solution

28
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,238
and a raised planter bed the roots are

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,239
suspended in the air

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,840
as we can see in this image up here and

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,280
typically do not make direct contact

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
with the nutrient solution in the

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,478
reservoir

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,080
but have the solution delivered via a

35
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,239
mist or supplied via

36
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,158
a pump there we kind of see the little

37
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,920
spray jets evident right here

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,680
typically plants are started in rockwell

39
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960
or other medium and then placed into the

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
aeroponic system

41
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,158
so the roots have some substrate that

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
they initially start in the system can

43
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,680
be used for clones

44
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,758
and initially gets roots started for

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,759
cuttings as well

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,879
now the advantages to this system as you

47
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,400
can kind of see here the

48
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,920
pictures of the roots kind of speak for

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
themselves and

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,960
how you can get how do you get roots

51
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,640
that look like this well

52
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,399
the advantage is the grower has full

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,799
control over the nutrients delivered

54
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,118
directly to the roots of the plant

55
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,960
side to that is the grower has full

56
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,280
control of the nutrients so the grower

57
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,039
is needs to be on their game so to speak

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,478
with making sure they're delivering the

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,759
right amount of nutrients in the right

60
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,000
concentrations where more

61
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,599
is not necessarily better also this

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,399
system allows for aeration of the root

63
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,319
system

64
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
the water use is very efficient and

65
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,359
there's no need for growing medium

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,519
potentially maybe a little rockwell at

67
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,758
the beginning eliminating this cost

68
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,919
and also the disposal issue with a lot

69
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,839
of growers often forget about

70
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,598
however no system is perfect so the

71
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,520
disadvantages are due to the high level

72
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,799
of control a grower has

73
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,879
this needs to be attentive so

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,640
they may not be the best option for new

75
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,399
growers so this system

76
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,238
can perform great yields can perform

77
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,239
great routes but as i said the grower

78
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,239
needs to be aware of what's going on

79
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,800
so new growers just getting started may

80
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,878
struggle careful monitoring of

81
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,519
is essential which allows for nutrient

82
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,280
concentrations as well as ph values

83
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,959
typical nutrient solutions are changed

84
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
every seven to ten days

85
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,719
and the system should be cleaned between

86
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,439
growth cycles if not more often

87
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,000
the plant life depends on the life of

88
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,359
the pump

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,039
so growers need to be monitoring the

90
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
pump and ensure

91
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,318
that they also have backups and

92
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,360
electricity supplied to this type of

93
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,439
system

94
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
it can also be some upfront cost that

95
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,479
may be prohibitive

96
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,878
to some growers who are looking to

97
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,238
implement potentially this system

98
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,759
the equipment just to kind of show a

99
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,000
little image of kind of general

100
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,639
equipment is a container with a lid

101
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,519
the lid will have some form of plant

102
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,759
support

103
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,759
inside of the container water pump with

104
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,158
misting heads in this region here

105
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,878
a water monitor and of course a nutrient

106
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,799
solution

107
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,158
to ensure the plants are being properly

108
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
fed

109
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,158
now the targets for using this type of

110
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,799
system

111
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,519
would be to have a continuous water

112
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,680
monitor

113
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,439
so you need to have that continually

114
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,560
monitoring that water and the levels of

115
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,158
that water

116
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,759
to start with you're looking at a ppm

117
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,679
usually around 700

118
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,798
temperature of the water around 65

119
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
degrees fahrenheit

120
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
the ph around 5.5 to 6.5 with the target

121
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,199
or

122
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,719
ideal ph being 5.8 again these just

123
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,958
provide you with some general initial

124
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,280
targets and you can tweak them from here

125
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,080
as you see fit for your cannabis growing

126
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
operation
