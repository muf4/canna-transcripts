1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,678
here on this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,640
we'll be looking at some planting

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,318
specifics

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,480
stated for cannabis particularly

5
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,000
autoflowers planted outdoors

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,170
to give you some guidelines or some

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,919
direction if you're looking at planting

8
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,920
[Music]

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
outdoors

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,278
if you want to know some specifics about

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,320
planting autoflower cannabis outdoors

12
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,240
this is the video for you now autoflower

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,159
clones keep in mind it's as a reminder

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,719
that since autoflowers are based on days

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,119
old

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,558
there are no clones available so growers

17
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,159
must use seeds

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,599
so if you have autoflower clones

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,398
probably that can be the best thing

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,239
if you're looking at planting

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,480
autoflowers in particular definitely

22
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,919
want to focus on the seeds when it comes

23
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,878
to seeds i would advise

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,198
feminized seed because while the fields

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,878
should still be scouted for male plants

26
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,119
starting with feminized seeds will help

27
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:58,000
vastly reduce the number of male plants

28
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,959
to reduce the amount of wasted time on

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,640
these plants

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,079
that are not going to produce your end

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,799
desired product

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,118
if non-feminist feminized or diocese

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,600
seed is used more than 50 percent

34
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,280
of the plant started with can be male

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,158
reducing field densities by

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,879
half so ideally be a 50 50 split male to

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,478
females

38
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,478
but that's really going to basically cut

39
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,000
your field in half while still keeping

40
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,519
your area and expenses

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,560
at full so how long from the seed

42
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,879
or see to harvest this can

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,159
be variety dependent but be sure to

44
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,239
check with the specific

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,240
type that you're planting however the

46
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,879
typical range for autoflowers give you

47
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:39,599
an idea would be 68 to 95 days

48
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,879
with 75 days being the average again

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,319
check with the specific

50
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,000
uh purchase seeds that you have

51
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,758
check with whoever's supplying you the

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,399
seeds to get an idea of the duration of

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,759
time

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
because remember autoflowers again will

55
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,118
not be dependent on photo period

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,920
simple days can be counted

57
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,759
so how many plants per acre well in

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,680
typical plant densities are about eleven

59
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,319
thousand to eighteen thousand plants per

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,759
acre

61
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,199
just to give you a general idea for

62
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,239
these autoflowers and they give you some

63
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,118
just kind of idea what

64
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,519
what a size of an acre is it's about 60

65
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,639
of us

66
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,200
of a soccer field here or about 16

67
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,799
tennis courts in area so what's the

68
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,598
suggested plant spacing when we're

69
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,360
looking at

70
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:23,280
um autoflowers well the plant spacing

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,680
here we can see some different scenarios

72
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,000
provided if planting in rows this would

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,800
equate to about 222 plants

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,878
in a hundred feet by five foot bed if

75
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,719
you're using one row on a 30 inch bed

76
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,318
three rows and a sixty inch bed or two

77
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,159
rows on a 60 inch bed

78
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,000
this can give you idea again of the

79
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,479
plants per acre that you'll be looking

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,919
at

81
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,840
this is important to know because this

82
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,878
is going to depend how many

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,598
seeds you're going to be looking at

84
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,560
purchasing and kind of the area or

85
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,959
plant matter that you're going to be

86
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,000
producing in the end and in

87
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,039
the 12 inches apart in a row 16 or 18

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,878
inches apart

89
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,079
you could see how that's going to vary

90
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,479
the amount of plants you're going to

91
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
have

92
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,039
per acre now autoflowers as a reminder

93
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,560
again are not photoperiod dependent

94
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,359
since autoflowers will flower based on

95
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,439
days old

96
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,040
this can offer growers more flexibility

97
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,359
when it comes to planting date

98
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,878
however the climate and frost-free days

99
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,040
should be the driving force when it

100
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,799
comes to selecting your growing season

101
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,199
you want to try to maximize the best

102
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,200
growing days even if it's not looking at

103
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,079
the longest necessarily or transition

104
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,039
from longest to shorter days of the year

105
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,440
in general

106
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,239
autoflowers will produce smaller plants

107
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,560
and typically

108
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,799
smaller yield however they make up for

109
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,878
this with very growing very quickly

110
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,319
however they cannot be cloned they do

111
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:37,840
not require pruning or training so they

112
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,199
can be a labor savings and they're

113
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,719
thought to be more resilient to

114
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,518
stressful growing conditions even though

115
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,519
that could be kind of

116
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,719
variety dependent there but that's

117
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,158
smaller plants but they're quicker

118
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,080
turnaround time

119
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,919
so in areas with a longer growing season

120
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
this may afford growers the ability to

121
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,798
grow two

122
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,000
two plant cycles though most of the time

123
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,519
for outdoor growing you're looking at

124
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
one growing cycle

125
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,599
particularly in areas that have colder

126
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,120
climates so be sure you're timing that

127
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,039
well

128
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,319
we're looking at flower biomass how much

129
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,039
yield are we going to get well in

130
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,598
general

131
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,719
biomass based on categories the average

132
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,438
would be about that 2150 pounds to the

133
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,680
acre

134
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,120
and then below average and above average

135
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,478
information given there

136
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,000
if you're wondering about where to get

137
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,719
some more information or where do these

138
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,560
numbers

139
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,840
came from in the description you'll see

140
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,519
a link to the sources

141
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,198
that you're welcome to go investigate

142
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,560
further but hopefully this will provide

143
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
you with a starting point

144
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,839
for at least autoflowers to give you

145
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
some sense of

146
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,119
you know what should you should be

147
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,680
looking at if you're looking at outdoor

148
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
field planting of autoflowers
