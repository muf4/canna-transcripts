1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
so just as the name implies these medium

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,009
moisture meters are simply meters that

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,039
will measure or assess the moisture

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:13,169
level in a given media net could be soil

5
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,759
at B soilless media they give you a

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,469
reading or an assessment and number to

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,199
go on as far as what that moisture

8
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,759
content is these moisture meters just

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,199
it's like there are water monitors for

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,170
nutrients we get it's important to

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,480
concealing monitor the soil moisture

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,439
level at the root zone so keep in mind I

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,820
should have this picture here because

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,609
you want to think the roots are in kind

15
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,049
of a 3d image when I think about it and

16
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,880
not just kind of a flat oh it cut the

17
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:39,238
soil in half and here's our roots it's a

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,239
3d have structure going on there so how

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,339
that moisture level isn't that media is

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,919
important for us as growers to know and

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,629
understand so motion rays are great

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,939
tools but they need to be calibrated and

23
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:53,339
installed properly only as good as the

24
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:56,939
operator so this is we have here for the

25
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,010
post rate I'm calculating the weight

26
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,849
there of a letter we want to show that's

27
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,378
calibrated

28
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,870
want to make sure also our moisture

29
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,459
meters are calibrated and depending on

30
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:07,379
which one you select or use will have

31
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,938
different calibration procedures the key

32
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:11,158
partisans is some way I realize they do

33
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,829
need to be calibrated to get accurate

34
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,290
and consistent readings for you so you

35
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:19,408
want to watch three units that they use

36
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,689
some low numbers indicate low moisture

37
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,060
and this makes more sense to people

38
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:26,039
others have low numbers meaning high

39
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,390
moisture so keep this in mind when

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,609
you're going through and purchasing one

41
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,049
be aware of the units that it chooses to

42
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,030
use just like we have Fahrenheit to

43
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,490
Celsius here we're looking at the you

44
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,590
know the same temperature here but very

45
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,000
different numbers they're just important

46
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,680
to know that and also if you're

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,450
comparing to other friends or other

48
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,430
people that are using moisture meters

49
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,368
being mindful what unit they're using

50
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,840
and what their numbers equate to just to

51
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:51,810
give you can that a nice quick general

52
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,728
summary provide a table here the water

53
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,439
scout the watermark and tensiometer you

54
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:57,959
have a picture of them all three here

55
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,879
again the all their pros and cons the

56
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,259
water scale is the most expensive but

57
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,420
does have the greatest accuracy

58
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,759
these have a slower response time the

59
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,280
water marks they're affordable and offer

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,489
a good level of accuracy intense

61
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,140
diameters they're lower-cost not as

62
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,650
useful and really dry conditions because

63
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,169
they only go

64
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,330
is Santa bars here that's the unit this

65
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,469
also measures incentive ours here so

66
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,080
again just look at the options it

67
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:24,299
depends on what operation you have with

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,709
media you might be using as far as which

69
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:29,159
one might be the best fit for your

70
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:31,620
operation personally I've seen in no

71
00:02:29,158 --> 00:02:34,169
growers who have used all of these I've

72
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,509
chosen use the water scout I do feel it

73
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:37,979
is highly accurate when it's set up

74
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:41,128
properly so again that stresses the

75
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:43,199
point there that the moisture sensor is

76
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:45,298
only as good as the way to mount it and

77
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,280
if you mounted in accurately place it

78
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,840
wrong in the grow operation that will

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,759
give you false results but that's I'm

80
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,170
you know so take take some time actually

81
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,959
read the instruction manual make sure

82
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:56,729
they installed properly calibrated some

83
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,170
require are soaked ahead of time follow

84
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:59,759
those procedures and they will give you

85
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:02,548
accurate readings they'll provide you

86
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,439
with good data to allow you to know

87
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,799
what's going on in the root zone of your

88
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,799
plants
