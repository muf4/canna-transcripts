1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,149
when we're looking at a growing

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,609
environment we're looking at modifying

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,200
the conditions many of these conditions

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,970
I have here I've kind of the six most

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,219
popular ones a lot of times we use

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,080
equipment to do this and this equipment

7
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:14,638
can malfunctions we need to be mindful

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,618
of that so you don't have these

9
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,769
technical difficulties because the

10
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,240
plants are not going to wait idly by so

11
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,219
the equipment in any grow operation

12
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,108
there is a need to include equipment be

13
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,268
sure to know what equipment is rated for

14
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,300
and do not exceed the recommendations as

15
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:32,939
is concern the life of the product and

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,250
this could be for example water pumps or

17
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,259
heaters they usually have stated amounts

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,909
or areas that they cover and you want to

19
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,609
try to hit that recommended amount or

20
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,929
low low if you exceed that that's where

21
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,479
you're shorting the light is shorting

22
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,250
the life of that also be aware of

23
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,988
maintenance that may be required with

24
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,329
any piece of equipment as often this can

25
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:52,979
be very easy or minimal but it doesn't

26
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,989
mean it can be missed or forgotten about

27
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,759
so for example just checking the oil in

28
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,159
your car can be a very quick and easy

29
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,558
test but something that if forgotten

30
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,709
about could lead to failure of the

31
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,478
engine there now for one thing we're

32
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,298
trying to moderate typically no-go area

33
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,829
is heating so generally wears some form

34
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,330
of energy source you need to make sure

35
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:13,769
you have a consistent source of this

36
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:15,780
energy and this could be wood this could

37
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:20,280
be coal sweet propane's could be

38
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,359
electricity even natural gas regular gas

39
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,640
there's a whole bunch of different

40
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,368
options yeah make sure that you plan

41
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,710
ahead it's your core your heating source

42
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:30,150
especially as you get into colder winter

43
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:33,089
conditions where you're likely to go

44
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,219
through the required heat source much

45
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,079
quicker we want to be running out or

46
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,819
ordering it when everyone else needs it

47
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,699
prices will go up and it will be harder

48
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,279
to get AAPIs of that way of cooling this

49
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,649
can often be very costly for operations

50
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,299
it is possible to cool an outdoor grow

51
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,129
space with shade netting kinda like

52
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,000
putting sunglasses over the plants but

53
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,009
you planning this will reduce the

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,269
overall light that reaches the plant so

55
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,459
he mindful of how much you're shooting

56
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:58,019
the plants fans do not cool the plant

57
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,239
they only mix the air and keep it moving

58
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:01,859
which can help increase transpiration to

59
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,429
aid in the natural cooling process of

60
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,519
the plant true cooling required air

61
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,560
exchange as an air conditioner unit

62
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,090
split-level cooling units there's a lot

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,830
of different options but they typically

64
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,800
consume a lot of electricity

65
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,020
to keep that in mind after lights old

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,080
bulbs wolves reduced their efficiency

67
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,150
slowly over time as a result growers

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,130
will typically not notice it poorly

69
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,430
producing gulp simply by looking at it

70
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,439
it'll still appear to be very bright

71
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,520
this is where par metres come in are

72
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,169
highly recommended as well as

73
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,930
documentation of the purchase date an

74
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:38,280
estimated number of hours of usage you

75
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,319
can write the purchase date right on the

76
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,930
bulb itself or keep that as part of your

77
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,060
records so you kind of know about what

78
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,189
you should be changing that out on the

79
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,890
calendar based on the hours you plan I'm

80
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:51,449
using that Lowell reflectors can't

81
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:52,859
forget it everything's of the bulbs

82
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:55,349
can't forget about the reflectors here's

83
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,959
two different options reflectors can

84
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:59,099
also reduce their efficiency over time

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,750
bulbs need to be changed more frequently

86
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,729
but changing reflectors should be

87
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,759
considered about every two to four years

88
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:08,069
best way to know if the or estimate your

89
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,139
reflector efficiency is to test with a

90
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,030
par meter each time you add a new bulb

91
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,699
if you get two feet away let that bowl

92
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,430
warm up test the power at the plant

93
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,018
level and every time you add a new bulb

94
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,640
test it out and see based on

95
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,769
documentation records that see if it's

96
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,018
the same they'll tell you the amount of

97
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,969
light being reflected and if it becomes

98
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,530
a below a certain amount you may want to

99
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:30,719
consider changing out that reflector you

100
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,219
have the photo period determines the

101
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,229
stage of growth the clip will be in and

102
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,000
if there's a problem with the amount of

103
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:38,250
light or really want to think about as

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,050
hours of continuous darkness this can

105
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,959
create plants that are not in the proper

106
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,489
stage that the grower expects purchasing

107
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,959
quality timers and also check them to

108
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,090
ensure their accuracy during the entire

109
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,860
growth cycle some girls will prefer

110
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,170
these analog style ones because they can

111
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,610
physically see if it gets off digital

112
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,049
ones you kind of got to be there to be

113
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,730
able to tell there's no real physical

114
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,670
means you can go through and take a look

115
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:01,319
at so again they both work just fine

116
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:03,268
some girls do prefer the analog for that

117
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,159
reason but have some way of checking to

118
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,590
make sure your plants are under the

119
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,090
proper photo period community is

120
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,409
important because depending on the

121
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,150
growth stage the plant will determine

122
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:14,280
the proper percentage you want to

123
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,900
maintain when plants are younger and

124
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,668
smaller one have a higher community as

125
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,978
they get older it's hard to produce the

126
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,539
buds we want to reduce that humidity so

127
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,609
you can having control over this I'm

128
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,500
doing containers I'm having a way to

129
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,720
regulate the committee are all important

130
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,779
things to consider

131
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,370
and also monitor water pumps often pumps

132
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,139
are necessary component but growers will

133
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,540
commonly undersized the pumps causing an

134
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,759
increase in wear and tear reducing their

135
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,650
overall life you want to oversize pumps

136
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,180
to be sure in continuing to monitor them

137
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:44,759
since it will typically burn out without

138
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,410
little warning I also set up a schedule

139
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,000
to ensure regular cleanings of filters

140
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,530
so if you are running a complex

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,750
operation here and you have some filters

142
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:53,459
those filters may need to be changed at

143
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,079
certain times or just go through and

144
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,149
monitor them depending on the quality of

145
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,689
water that you have but it's a sediment

146
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:02,279
filter or chlorine filter fans are great

147
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:05,189
for air circulation but they can die

148
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:06,599
without warning so you also want to be

149
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:09,149
mindful of how old they are what their

150
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,920
expected life maybe watch the blades and

151
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:14,000
cages to ensure that they're cleaned as

152
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,110
needed to maintain the peak efficiencies

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,629
typically accumulate a lot of dust and

154
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,220
the fan blades and that can cause them

155
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:22,529
to kind of overheat and work harder than

156
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,670
they need to which can vastly reduce

157
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:25,669
their expected life
