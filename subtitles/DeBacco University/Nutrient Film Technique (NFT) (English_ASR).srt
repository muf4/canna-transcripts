1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
okay here I'll look at the nutrient film

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,020
technique which is involved with

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,000
hydroponics typically abbreviated n ft

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,579
you can see in this diagram we have a

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,589
nutrient solution with an airstone and

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,750
keep it aerated nutrient pump pumping

7
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:19,769
that nutrient solution here at the top

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,809
level of a trough the water then through

9
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,489
gravity flows down passing over the

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,079
roots allowing plants uptake vital

11
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:26,669
nutrients and then exiting out the

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,979
bottom here back into our reservoir

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,390
sometimes timers can be used to run this

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,960
other times this will be run for a

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,489
continuous to 24 hours now this NFD

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,980
technique allows for high degree of

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,259
detail and can maximize performance we

18
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,238
see the very same setup here this

19
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,890
supplies aerated nutrient solution to

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,269
the roots of the plant and the plants

21
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,280
with a strong root system are

22
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,230
established with a capillary mat and are

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,689
fed a continually aerated nutrient

24
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:54,238
solution in a channel system this allows

25
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:57,058
for the recirculation of that nutrient

26
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,530
solution with a holding reservoir the

27
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,750
size of that reservoir will depend on

28
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,460
the amount or area that you'll be kind

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,349
of running the nutrient solution through

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,200
irrigation is typically done for a

31
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,609
continued 24 hours some will have timers

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,728
that will turn off for a short period of

33
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:14,519
time but may times is run off for 24

34
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:16,679
hours plants are commonly grown in rows

35
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,469
that are tightly covered to allow for a

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,170
high humidity within the root zone again

37
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:24,000
we see the same basic setup here hoping

38
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,118
that water through and allowed to drain

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,469
back if the roots dry out they will die

40
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,150
and this is why it's important to

41
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,310
maintain a high degree of humidity

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,780
there's also concern about the pumps and

43
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,728
the spread of disease and this is why

44
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,430
these inners should be covered and

45
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:40,849
should be monitored so that we're not

46
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,939
spreading disease throughout the entire

47
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:46,769
operation here now because of this a

48
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,769
variety of reasons this technique is

49
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,780
actually lost popularity and it's

50
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,188
typically used with hobby growers or

51
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,439
those that are growing lettuce

52
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:57,779
there's lots popular in a large scale

53
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,629
for the fear of quick spreading of

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,829
disease in a recirculating solution and

55
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:05,039
this is why it's been shied away from

56
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:06,239
now an urban media like Rockwell is the

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,429
preferred source for large-scale

58
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,139
operations provide plants with the

59
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,580
continual access to water but it can be

60
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,469
more beneficial to have specific

61
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,820
irrigation events for fruiting crops

62
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,500
this is another reason why it's been

63
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,019
lost its popularity on large-scale

64
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,330
production this if a crop is looking at

65
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,550
producing the fruit are a heavy

66
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,530
carbohydrate load it might be beneficial

67
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,730
to actually have some dry down events

68
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,680
and have some re irrigation events here

69
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:33,629
with this 24-hour system with continual

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,629
flow of nutrients might be best for the

71
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,340
consistency of leafy greens but not so

72
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,969
much for those looking at high fruit

73
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,969
load stress
