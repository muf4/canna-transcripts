1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:05,069
here we're going to investigate bulk

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,939
transport so the reason I have this

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:11,699
image of a large tanker ship is this is

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,589
moving a large quantity of materials and

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,289
we're gonna relate this to cells in

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:19,019
biology and how do cells move large

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:23,340
quantities of material in and throughout

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:26,129
their environments so this might sound

9
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:29,399
familiar a bulk transport involves these

10
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,989
vesicles small particles or groups of

11
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,879
molecules to enter or leave the cell

12
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,189
without actually passing through the

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,010
membrane it's containing them to

14
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,049
mechanisms of bulk transport our

15
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:43,640
endocytosis and exocytosis

16
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:46,409
so endo is taking something in

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,850
exocytosis is something is leaving or

18
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:52,529
exiting the cell so bulk transport is

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,329
the transport large particles and

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,899
macromolecules across the plasma

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,058
membrane our endocytosis has three

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,460
different types our exercisers this has

23
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:05,069
one major type so endocytosis is

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,210
receptor mediated endocytosis and

25
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,289
phagocytosis

26
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:12,929
so phagocytosis is cell eating in this

27
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,509
case we have the engulfing of objects

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,400
this happens in our immune system quite

29
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,859
a bit here we have a neutrophil which is

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,310
a white blood cell chasing down and

31
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,728
attacking this bacteria it's not eating

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,070
any of the red blood cells these round

33
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:30,509
kind of round looking cells here because

34
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,158
it's recognizing those itself it's

35
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,140
recognizing this small little bacteria

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,840
as an invader and that's why it's

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,200
chasing it down and ultimately engulfing

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,680
yet there it would engulf it bind to it

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,868
and Gulf it and then use what lysosomes

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,270
which contain digestive enzymes they'll

41
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:50,509
break it down to basically soluble

42
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:54,239
debris that's nothing to harm the cell

43
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:55,829
pinocytosis is it cell drinking and

44
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,929
ism's drink extracellular fluid it's

45
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:00,389
binding the substances and it's pinching

46
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,060
off and it's taking in typically ions

47
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,118
with a lot of water so pinocytosis is

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,118
kind of pinching here the membranes and

49
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:11,580
create the vesicle it's collecting

50
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:13,400
extracellular fluid typically ions along

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,020
with water

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,740
receptor-mediated endocytosis this is

53
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:23,189
the most efficient form its receptors on

54
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,670
the actual exterior surface of the cell

55
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:29,310
membrane that bind to target molecules

56
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:31,049
specific target molecules their circles

57
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,840
and they carry ligands and receptors

58
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,770
into the cell so here we have a receptor

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,310
it's binding only to one's very specific

60
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,450
thing that one very specific thing

61
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,900
doesn't matter what else is around the

62
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,729
cell

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,129
that's what's buying tuna too it's

64
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:50,069
collecting it's essentially what's

65
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:52,560
accumulating so this receptor media is

66
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:54,810
important because it's this cells way of

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,000
being able to bind to and collect only

68
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,709
one specific substance so just rambling

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,949
grabbing things it's able to bind

70
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:04,050
something very specific the opposite

71
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:06,839
process of all this it says exocytosis

72
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:10,920
it's the reverse of endocytosis instead

73
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,689
of taking something in it is removing or

74
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,639
something and this could be waste

75
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:17,129
something as an excess amount of

76
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,159
something that another cell may need it

77
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:22,829
could be a signal so exocytosis I don't

78
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,969
want you always to think of wastes even

79
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,980
though that's typically what's

80
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:29,099
associated with but it could be other

81
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,349
valuable signals to get out into the

82
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:34,139
extracellular fluid so that cells around

83
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:37,009
it can be how that signal and that's one

84
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:41,238
way of communication between cells

85
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:44,399
the last part here the thyroid hormones

86
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:47,400
synthesis process it's very complex

87
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,900
however you should be understand the

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,939
circled items here and I circled em in

89
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,519
blue here some of these take you back to

90
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,430
some other video lectures such as

91
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,829
organelles with the nucleus and

92
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,709
reticulum are symporters what those are

93
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:04,530
about endocytosis what is that in

94
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,509
exocytosis so this is kind of a good way

95
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,549
to kind of make sure you're able to kind

96
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:10,649
of put all the pieces together from the

97
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,819
series of videos that i have created are

98
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,319
you all going to go back and look at

99
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,180
some of those if you're and there were

100
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,548
some of these terms so that you're able

101
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,798
now to start to understand a little bit

102
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,108
more of some of the processes that occur

103
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,728
as you can see here just thyroid

104
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,098
hormones very complex and they

105
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,819
understand all the parts but it should

106
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:30,060
be at ease

107
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:32,370
understand some of the aspects that are

108
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,589
going on here to help you speak into

109
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,590
understand the larger process
