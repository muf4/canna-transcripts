1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,120
okay here i'm going to go over if you

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,440
find something that you

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
suspect to be blood at a crime scene how

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,440
do you go about attack

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,919
detecting whether blood is present in

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,678
the evidence that you have found

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,359
so starting first with the light source

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,879
this is often the first tool used to

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,198
investigate a crime scene

10
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,799
why because it can cover a large area

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,199
efficiently can identify

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,920
more than just blood bodily fluids can

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,160
be

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,840
identified that would not be visible

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,920
under normal lighting conditions

16
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,678
also fingerprints might be able to be

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,640
seen under these artificial light

18
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:33,839
sources

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,920
these artificial light sources are

20
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
typically high intense light or uv

21
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
light are used to help identify this

22
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,320
trace evidence at a scene

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,079
then there are reagent tests these are

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
examples of presumptive tests

25
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,239
now presumptive tests can only confirm

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,360
the presence or absence of a sample kind

27
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:50,878
of as a positive or

28
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,320
negative it doesn't really tell you much

29
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,198
more than that but that can still be

30
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,480
important

31
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,839
these tests function based on the

32
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,439
properties of hemoglobin in the blood

33
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,000
and are often used

34
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,920
with some type of chemical reaction

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,359
resulting in a color change in this case

36
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,439
you see the negative being clear

37
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,680
the positive being a purple pinkish

38
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,599
color further test that the crime lab

39
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
can determine if it's human blood or not

40
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,839
but this at least gives the investigator

41
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,519
some

42
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,079
initial results there's a blood reagent

43
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,679
test or

44
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,079
phenolphthalein this is typically

45
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,840
referred as a castle meyer test and

46
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,840
produces a pink color when it reacts

47
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,880
with hemoglobin so here we have a red

48
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,400
substance that we

49
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,399
suspect is blood while using

50
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,640
phenothalene here we can see

51
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
it turns pink from a clear solution this

52
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,759
is indicating it is blood

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,920
does not confirm that it's human blood

54
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,239
or frog's blood or something else

55
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
but this is an initial step in the

56
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,560
investigation

57
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,118
process we also have broad reagent test

58
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,040
examples

59
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,719
hemostix is another one it's a strip

60
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,000
that's been coated with

61
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,759
tetramethylbenzodine and it will produce

62
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,359
a green to bluish green color with the

63
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,118
presence of hemoglobin

64
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,159
and again this is kind of on the bottle

65
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:57,200
it kind of gives you that color

66
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,200
indication

67
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,640
can be another quick way to be able to

68
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,680
determine whether or not the

69
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,118
substance you're looking at is blood

70
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
there's also luminol which is a chemical

71
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:09,520
that can

72
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,959
locate traces of blood even it's been

73
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
cleaned or removed

74
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,000
investigators spray the luminol solution

75
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,319
throughout

76
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,318
the area and that's under investigation

77
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,719
and we'll look at the reactions with

78
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,878
iron present in the blood which causes a

79
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,479
blue luminescence to occur

80
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,639
however this chemical does react with

81
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,399
other substances potentially some

82
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,919
metals and paints and cleaning products

83
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,120
and also plant materials

84
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,119
so again this isn't a 100 guarantee

85
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
but it does provide at least some

86
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,319
initial steps

87
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,920
to try to determine potentially what

88
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,439
you're looking at maybe blood

89
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,359
so use this with caution because this

90
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,079
chemical reaction can destroy the

91
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
evidence

92
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,200
on the crime scene so if you're using

93
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,518
overusing this you can be potentially

94
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,799
harming the original evidence which can

95
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,920
impact the investigation

96
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,599
later on we also have

97
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,359
fluorescent which is a chemical similar

98
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,399
to luminol and it has that same kind of

99
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,440
like fluorescent-like

100
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
properties it's also capable of

101
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,158
detecting

102
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,479
latent which is can't be seen or old

103
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,318
blood it's ideal for fine stains and

104
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,000
smears found throughout the crime scene

105
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,598
and after the solution has been sprayed

106
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,158
onto the suspect

107
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,839
suspected area uv light and goggles are

108
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,079
used to detect any luminous

109
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,080
areas so color wheel appears greenish

110
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
white if blood is present it may also

111
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
react with many of the same things that

112
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,560
luminol does

113
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,919
including but not limited to copper and

114
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,759
bleach so again

115
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:34,798
use it with caution we also have the

116
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,639
lcv or the leucocrystal violet test

117
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,400
and this is a chemical process used to

118
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,518
visually enhance

119
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,840
blood that allows for easier photography

120
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,879
and analysis from there on here we can

121
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,560
see the image

122
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,639
where we don't really see much of a

123
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,158
footprint here but here we spray it with

124
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,318
crystal violet we can see that purple

125
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,079
color it becomes much more evident

126
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,518
a lot better to photograph and be able

127
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,680
to carry on for further

128
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,799
parts of the investigation we see the

129
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,360
same thing again with

130
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,360
a fingerprint
