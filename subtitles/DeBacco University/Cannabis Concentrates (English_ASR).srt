1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,388
so while there's many cannabis

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,459
concentrates we're gonna focus just on a

3
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:07,318
couple here to try to give a little more

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,289
background information exactly what

5
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,240
those are so curious concentrates will

6
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:14,579
the whole goal is to refine extract from

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,469
the cannabis plant goes to purify the

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,839
cannabinoids and create end product with

9
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,519
more consistency than the flower or bud

10
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,550
so flowers can have a lot of variability

11
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,129
with them result or concentrate is to

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,449
take that and condense it down to have a

13
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:29,460
little bit more of a consistent product

14
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,689
something that maybe contains a certain

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,289
chemical profile better is something as

16
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,960
a cake-like

17
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,670
better or valuable consistency and this

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,770
term is more to do with the actual

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,200
consistency of the product rather than

20
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,820
the actual chemical profile so don't

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,609
confuse this term in a special type of

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,329
oil or anything like that the t's have

23
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:52,920
simply replaced with deeds crumble is

24
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,780
kind of in the same category where it's

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,300
a dry oil as nothing to do with

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,920
different concentration it only refers

27
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,288
to the consistency such as like

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,329
breadcrumbs or crumb topping here

29
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,890
nothing to do with again at the chemical

30
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,780
profile shatter as a translucent product

31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,510
made with a solvent typically has this

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,180
amber like coloration the concentrates

33
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,400
it can be a very potent product requires

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,590
a special apparatus called a rig and

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,780
heats the product is seventy-five

36
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,130
hundred seventy-five degrees or to six

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,409
hundred twenty five degrees Fahrenheit

38
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,179
what this does is creates an instant

39
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,640
vaporization of the product which could

40
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,970
cause an overwhelming high especially

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,700
for those high in THC so this is going

42
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:37,140
to be a concern or something to use in

43
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,180
moderation because of the instant

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,750
vaporization the way the shadow is used

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,070
I can create this overwhelming high

46
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,859
distillate is another form this is

47
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,629
refined have annoyed oil is often the

48
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,319
end product is free of taste smell and

49
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:51,569
flavor

50
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,279
it's coming soon edibles and vape pens

51
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,408
you have the picture here of moonshine

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,299
that's kind of the distilled process

53
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,100
that same occurs itself berry alcohol

54
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,729
from water here we're kind of using the

55
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:06,509
same idea same process to separate out

56
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:08,068
certain compounds dry sift is a ground

57
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,989
in screened cannabis it contains the

58
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,750
full trichome profile which some growers

59
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,560
really look for it's really sifted

60
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,560
through a screen

61
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,469
to create this very consistent product

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,180
in texture hash or bubble hash is

63
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:23,310
compressed resonance derived in

64
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,290
separating trichomes and that are

65
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,569
condensed with heat and pressure this

66
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:29,639
produces a very potent product bubble

67
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:32,009
hash is more refined and traditional has

68
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:35,609
but it's not quite as refined as the

69
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:37,889
shatter I talked about previously rosin

70
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,140
as in name originates from a product

71
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:41,669
used to lubricate violin bows so don't

72
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,889
think that all the cannabis people here

73
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:46,139
are from completely have generated

74
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:48,268
completely different terms it's a simple

75
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,818
and easy process at least the basic idea

76
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,530
is the creation of rosin it's a made

77
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:53,909
from the entire kingdoms bud and

78
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,789
considered to be very versatile

79
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:58,079
efficient in a safe method safer than

80
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:00,629
some of the others because it contains

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,730
no solvents in the process as a result

82
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:06,120
but this is a high grade concentrate

83
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:08,780
that can be used in a variety of end

84
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,780
products there
