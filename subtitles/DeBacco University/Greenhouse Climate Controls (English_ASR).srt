1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,019
when we're thinking about greenhouse and

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,939
climate controls we don't want to just

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,559
think about heating we don't want to

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,839
think about cooling and I think about

5
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,699
how heating and cooling interact along

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,429
with a lot of other things associated

7
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,469
with efficient greenhouse production

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,629
include a link down here that gives a

9
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:20,519
great kind of heating alternatives and

10
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:21,960
some good information for those that are

11
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,539
seeking a little bit more regarding

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,929
greenhouses that bean has kind of

13
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,820
control ventilation is important for any

14
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:32,429
greenhouse or high tunnel keeping air

15
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,750
moving through that structure keep in

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,179
mind if you are adding fans you are

17
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,039
looking at a greenhouse here fans are

18
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,679
much more efficient at pulling the air

19
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,179
not pushing air so exhaust fans

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,399
typically if you walk by only to get

21
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,019
blown by those fans because they're

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,350
pulling air through the greenhouse and

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,359
out they're not really that great at

24
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,370
pushing air this is why exhausting flow

25
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,988
of air out this is why you see these are

26
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:56,669
inlets here

27
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,529
screen netting over them to prevent

28
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,710
insects from getting pulled into the

29
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,480
structure here calculating the CFM or

30
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,070
cubic feet per minute needed for both

31
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,500
exhaust fans and shutter size can be

32
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,658
calculated via these online calculators

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,670
so provided I've found a couple really

34
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,979
good ones I think that'll I to plug in

35
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,439
different sizes of structures and to be

36
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,150
able to get kind of an idea of what size

37
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,969
fan or what size vent you should be

38
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,680
adding to your particular structure now

39
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,170
heating systems are management types of

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,820
heating systems original and general

41
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,460
combustion fuels have the potential to

42
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,769
generate unwanted gases such as ethylene

43
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,169
which can affect ripening and carbon

44
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:36,179
monoxide CL propane generates high

45
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,950
amounts of moisture wood can be easily

46
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,079
accessible but generates waste in the

47
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,409
ash and often requires manual feeding

48
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,569
oil easy to get in large quantities but

49
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,680
the furnace does require maintenance

50
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:49,078
Electric can be reliable and easy to

51
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,720
control it doesn't generate wasted or

52
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:54,239
unwanted byproducts but can be very

53
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,879
expensive for cooling systems a simple

54
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,379
thermostat an exhaust fan can suffice

55
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:59,819
key is to have enough intake air and

56
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,769
that's where the open roof design can

57
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,750
help alleviate some of the heat issues

58
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,039
air conditioning systems can be

59
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,379
installed to ensure an accurate

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,810
temperature is reached but these could

61
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,209
also be very expensive to run and also

62
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,248
maintain heat pumps can be used swamp

63
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,069
coolers for suited for small

64
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:20,248
applications and with not a lot of heat

65
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:22,259
to remove and these swamp coolers work

66
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:25,280
best in areas with low humidity so for

67
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:28,108
example Arizona in the southwest

68
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,938
misting systems can be employed these

69
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:31,650
are very simple design they can offer so

70
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:33,718
I'm going to be of cooling the droplet

71
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,670
size should be considered a miss system

72
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:39,180
you want really really fine particles

73
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:41,578
the finer LF more like a fogging system

74
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,709
if the droplets get to larges can wet

75
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,950
the floor or surface which may not be

76
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:49,079
wanted you can also leave a lot of heavy

77
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:51,899
moisture that can increase rot or mold

78
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:54,269
that could occur those large droplets

79
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,039
give it algae a chance to grow which is

80
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,889
just unwanted even though we do want the

81
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,000
cooling advantage other

82
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:02,219
irrigation systems there's many

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,139
different types even some our hydroponic

84
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:06,388
we're looking at irrigation systems in

85
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,609
general hand watering is the most basic

86
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,469
but is very time consuming flood and

87
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,510
drain avicii implemented in this grow

88
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:15,150
tent is suited for bench style

89
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:17,158
operations large cellars also drip

90
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,819
irrigation where it's evenly dispersing

91
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:23,098
water over a long distance

92
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:25,018
supplemental lighting main may not be

93
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:26,668
thought of is needed but for a

94
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,969
year-round production especially during

95
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:31,290
winter months this can be advantageous

96
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:32,430
LED lights are showing promise in this

97
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,560
area

98
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,879
they're very efficiently mounted they're

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,039
not consuming a lot of power there

100
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:41,039
passively cooled high pressure sodium

101
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,198
have also been implemented in the past a

102
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,900
little bit not quite as efficient as a

103
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,849
true full-spectrum LED but another

104
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,680
option to consider for greenhouse

105
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:52,408
production

106
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,879
co2 in Richmond assuming that all of the

107
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:56,758
growing environment aspects are

108
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,649
maximized only then the co2 then become

109
00:03:56,758 --> 00:04:01,168
a limiting factor so if you don't have

110
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,699
enough light or enough heat or enough

111
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,379
nutrients so this can all negatively

112
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,180
impact plants if all those are

113
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,518
accidentally looking for that next step

114
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,799
up well then you can consider co2 at

115
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,688
Richmond this is justified operations

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,968
looking for maximum yield if he is

117
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:18,089
required to use a su 2 generator as is

118
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:20,759
concerned dual purpose here we have the

119
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,978
burners going on generating co2 off in

120
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,889
the form of propane in heating the room

121
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:28,918
at the same time if heat is already kind

122
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:31,019
of it - you can use regular bottle tanks

123
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,240
or liquid systems and these basically

124
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:36,209
generate no unwanted byproducts and

125
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,400
efficiently elevate co2 levels in the

126
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,629
throws base

127
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,728
if there's too much Sun in the area

128
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:43,500
shade cloth can be implemented to reduce

129
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:45,810
the sun's intensity there's different

130
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,430
percentages of safe shade cloth comes a

131
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,680
variety of colors black being the most

132
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,478
common however when we're looking at

133
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,699
heat reduction black and absorb a lot of

134
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:55,288
heat even though it is kind of reducing

135
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,270
the amount of sun exposure the three

136
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:59,158
plants under it gap there's other

137
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:00,508
reflective netting like aluminum which

138
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:02,848
is Lily looks like little bits of

139
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,800
aluminum very shiny can also help

140
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:06,839
produce the shade effect with not quite

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,270
as getting as hot because reflecting

142
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,918
some more of the heat and light here

143
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:14,008
it's just blocking some of the light and

144
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:14,810
getting warmer especially on long summer

145
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,520
days

146
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,139
light deprivation so monitoring and

147
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,799
maintaining proper photo periods for

148
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,840
cannabis can be very important and it

149
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,520
needs to be regulated as a result we see

150
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,918
the same materials here that in one side

151
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,319
they're very dark and black to block out

152
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,448
screams to allow growers to precisely

153
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,158
regulate photo periods of their crop in

154
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,439
the other side it can be white to kind

155
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:40,408
of this white with black stripes to this

156
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,180
kind of almost mylar look to it both of

157
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:44,250
these design or all three of these

158
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,740
designs on the outside help reflect

159
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,259
light but on the inside can be dark on

160
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,449
themselves to help prevent light from

161
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,669
getting into the crop along rows to

162
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,199
maximize their crops either being a

163
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:57,139
vegetative or the flowering state

164
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,400
regardless of the outside conditions

165
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,718
data logging is also important it's

166
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,339
going to easy way to track conditions in

167
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:03,870
the growing environment they can use to

168
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:06,029
spot errors and make corrections to help

169
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,069
maximize production there's very small

170
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:09,899
portable units there's also very large

171
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:11,819
almost weather station related units

172
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,370
that can track a variety of factors and

173
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:17,069
data log them on a very continual basis

174
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,180
over the entire growing season so this

175
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,189
climate control these are a couple

176
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,168
things that focus on ventilation heating

177
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:24,569
cooling missing systems irrigation

178
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:26,609
supplemental lighting co2 generators or

179
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,830
enrichment shinning light block and data

180
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,110
logger are all important to help

181
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:33,689
maintain that you would almost in a car

182
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,110
consistent conditions to maximize plant

183
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,110
production
