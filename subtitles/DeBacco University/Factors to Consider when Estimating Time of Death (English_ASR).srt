1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
so here in this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,720
we're going to be looking at factors to

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,519
consider

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,320
when estimating the time of death and

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,759
we're going to look at some of the

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
digestive systems

7
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,279
some blood pooling to look at so these

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,120
are different factors

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,640
while not a complete list some key

10
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,000
factors to consider when estimating the

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,080
time of death

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,039
so first off the digestive contents we

13
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,559
want to keep in mind

14
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,439
these can help determine the time of

15
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,719
death by determining how long the person

16
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,000
was until

17
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,518
they ate until they died so seconds it

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,119
only takes seconds for chewed food to

19
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:33,839
pass through the esophagus down to the

20
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,280
stomach

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
four to six hours for the stomach to

22
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,439
empty its contents into the small

23
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,280
intestine

24
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,199
about 12 hours for the food to leave the

25
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
small intestine 24 hours until

26
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,879
undigested food is released from the

27
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,879
large intestine and this digestive

28
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,000
process usually takes a bit more time

29
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,320
than a day

30
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,359
but it can be affected by sickness

31
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,399
liquid intake

32
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,920
fear and also any drugs the person may

33
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,759
have consumed so you want to keep in

34
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,000
mind of these potential variables

35
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,238
to the times stated here when we're

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
trying to look at the digestive contents

37
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,000
of an individual

38
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
now looking at the eyes is another

39
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,599
indicator that can be used because the

40
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,118
eyes of the victim can also hold answers

41
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,519
to the time of death

42
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,040
there's a thin cloudy film that will

43
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,039
develop over the eye within about two to

44
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,479
three hours after death has occurred

45
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
if the eyes are closed though this will

46
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,280
take about 24 hours for this film to

47
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,759
appear

48
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
so keep that in mind is how the person

49
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,040
was found originally can influence again

50
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,280
these times

51
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,960
that are stated here the eyeballs become

52
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
softer as a result of less fluid

53
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,158
pressure behind the eye

54
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,000
and the degree to which this has

55
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,000
occurred can be used as a measure of the

56
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,359
time since death as well

57
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
keep in mind i have a couple little

58
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,599
chart here kind of looking at

59
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,159
uh open versus closed in the onset just

60
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,239
to give an approximation for trying to

61
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,118
pinpoint within as degrees accuracy we

62
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,640
can to estimate that time of death

63
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,478
we also have skin coloration to take

64
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
into consideration so the color the

65
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,039
corpse will help determine the time of

66
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
death from about

67
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,719
48 hours onwards so not great

68
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,118
determining under two days

69
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,319
but beyond two days this has a stronger

70
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,159
correlation

71
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,758
from approximately 40 hours after death

72
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,640
bacteria begin to breed in the skin

73
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,080
giving the skin

74
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,439
a noticeably green tone the tinge will

75
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,520
start in the lower stomach

76
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,800
area and spread outwards affecting the

77
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,959
hands and feet

78
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,800
last so they can also give an idea of

79
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,479
where that progression was found

80
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
or discovered on the individual

81
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,199
approximately four to seven days after

82
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,959
death the skin will

83
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,560
acquire this marble-like appearance and

84
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,800
this veins become

85
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,159
closer to the surface thus becoming more

86
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,319
easily visible

87
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,719
so again skin coloration another factor

88
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,799
to try to estimate that time of death

89
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,878
we also have blood pooling as we can see

90
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
here the pulling of blood

91
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,000
can be a vital clue in determining the

92
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,759
time of death and

93
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,598
is known as hypostasis this occurs when

94
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,598
blood ceases flowing selling the lowest

95
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,719
parts of the body and in turn causes the

96
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,119
skin to become pink

97
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,479
and red in color blood will pool at the

98
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,800
lowest parts of

99
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,119
the body usually starting between six to

100
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,879
eight hours after death has occurred

101
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
analyzing location of pulling can help

102
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,280
indicate the position of the body

103
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,959
also if we find that region and we kind

104
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,878
of apply some pressure

105
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,800
depending whether the coloration changes

106
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,759
or not or how quick it returns can also

107
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,239
help indicate

108
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,199
an estimate for time of death here in

109
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,519
the upper image

110
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,799
see the blood pulling in the back here

111
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,640
as this

112
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,640
person is left in what's called the

113
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,639
supine position there on their back

114
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,759
and that blood pulling indicates that

115
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,158
that is the position

116
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,239
they were in when they died so all these

117
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,199
are contributing factors to help

118
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,039
pinpoint

119
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,919
when the time of death had originally

120
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,919
occurred
