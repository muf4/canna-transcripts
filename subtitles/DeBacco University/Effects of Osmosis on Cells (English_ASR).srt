1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,579
here we go look at the effects of

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,910
osmosis on cells three important key

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,609
terms wanting to lay with our hypertonic

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:14,609
isotonic hypotonic and how these relate

5
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:16,320
and how these change the structure of

6
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,509
the cells and how some can lead to

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,368
potentially cell death and some

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,630
basically just not functioning properly

9
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:26,490
and what isotonic is here we'll look at

10
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,189
each of these in detail and how they

11
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:33,210
relate so starting with that same image

12
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,719
and defining our three key vocab terms

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,179
here

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,640
isotonic is the one in the middle this

15
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,189
is where solutions with the same solute

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,808
concentration as that was the cytosol

17
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,149
remember the cytosol is the interior

18
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:47,070
portions of the cell so here we see what

19
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,929
water moving in and water moving out

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,969
nice equal in equal out isotonic

21
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:56,039
hypertonic solutions having greater

22
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,469
solute concentrations than that of the

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,920
cytosol for water leaves the cell

24
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,159
causing this basic shrinkage to occur so

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,109
hypertonic the solution here having

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,549
greater site concentration than that of

27
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:13,680
the cytosol water leaving the cell

28
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,290
causing it to shrink so this is

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,720
basically causing this shriveled up here

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,000
and Stoker the opposite of that would be

31
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,310
hypotonic this is where solutions have

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,859
lesser solute concentration than that is

33
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,960
all water enters itself causing it to

34
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:32,159
swell and says here potentially the lice

35
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,828
causing them in this case the cells

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,020
slicing or it's exploding basically

37
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,459
breaking apart too much water's coming

38
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,379
into the cell causing it to swell up

39
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,929
that's why it looks a little more plump

40
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,569
than this one causing in this case it's

41
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,210
a lice or break apart so these are three

42
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:51,500
kind of situations we want to think

43
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:54,419
about how these cells are being affected

44
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,368
now those were animal cells are actually

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,890
red blood cells here we're looking at a

46
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:00,989
plant cell now plant cells have this

47
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,909
exterior cell wall so they have

48
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:06,089
something a little different plant cells

49
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,740
I mean turgid or firm this is generally

50
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,020
the healthiest in the hypotonic

51
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:12,269
environment where the uptake of water is

52
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,500
eventually balanced by the elastic wall

53
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,469
pushing back in the cell

54
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,860
so here turgid we have water coming in

55
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,870
this large vacuoles swelled up here a

56
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,930
lot of water containing it but that's

57
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,060
able to keep and maintain itself because

58
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,010
plant cells have a cell wall remember in

59
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,960
our hypotonic situations if we go back

60
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:33,329
to the red blood cells this was the

61
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,670
concept where he could 2/8 advice so

62
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,350
plant cells a little different they have

63
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,879
that so on they can hold that pressure

64
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,729
and islets keeps plants upright and

65
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,250
vertical isotonic they become flaccid

66
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:45,750
they can start to wilt a little bit and

67
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,740
yes we're having some water come in and

68
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,259
out and that's okay

69
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,180
who knows this little flaccid then here

70
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,399
an extreme case our hypertonic where a

71
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,860
lot of water is leaving this is

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,360
basically where the plant is really

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,160
blimp will thing down pretty heavily

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,270
where it can burn or cause severe damage

75
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:06,090
to it so hypertonic what do these

76
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,189
situations look like hypertonic osmotic

77
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,370
flow out of the cell so here's our

78
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:14,729
solute molecules here is ourselves here

79
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:18,180
in this case a great example this Iike

80
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:20,090
cucumber and you pickle it well that

81
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,400
pickling solution the brine solution

82
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:26,670
high amount of salt concentration in

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,170
that liquid environment causing our

84
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,899
wonderful locating line streamline

85
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:32,819
cucumber to become like a pickle to

86
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,000
shrivel up net what's occurring here

87
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,340
water molecules are leaving these cell

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,949
in this case they try to dilute the

89
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,409
solute or in this case a salt that's

90
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,060
located on the outside and that's what

91
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:49,769
causes the pickle to get that shriveled

92
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,819
look versus a cucumber hypotonic that

93
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,010
was the opposite of that

94
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,739
osmotic flowing into the cells so us

95
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:57,899
welding up in this case there's more

96
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,640
solute molecules inside the cell and

97
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,739
there are outside this could be if you

98
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,259
put something in pure water distilled

99
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,180
water free of ions this can cause cells

100
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:09,539
to swell up and if their red blood cells

101
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,060
they cannot ultimately lice or break

102
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,949
apart

103
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,319
isotonic as an equal movement of water

104
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,569
molecules both in and out itself this is

105
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,099
not the same as no movement so the site

106
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,379
molecules are the same on the inside and

107
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,770
the outside and water is coming in and

108
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,279
out at the same rate each molecule in

109
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:29,740
results in one

110
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,679
molecule out and sell there appears to

111
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,569
be no change so this one says no osmotic

112
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,850
flow this could be kind of misleading if

113
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:38,649
I couldn't down here no I'm gonna clone

114
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,790
most people think that's just not going

115
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:41,829
to move everything's going to stay where

116
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,500
it is well that's not necessarily the

117
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:46,029
case water can be coming in but for

118
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,220
every mouthful that comes in one comes

119
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:50,109
out pretty mild killer comes out one

120
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,680
comes in so this is where you get to

121
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:56,919
equal movement okay not no movement but

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,530
equal movement so it appears there's to

123
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:01,930
be no change

124
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:04,000
get hypertonic hypotonic and isotonic

125
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,610
shown those same images remember

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,310
hypertonic is like those salt solution

127
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,629
causing it to kind of shrink hypotonic

128
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,680
the cells swelling it

129
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:16,000
isotonic it's equal movement in and out

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,250
looking at our red blood cells this is

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,168
the proper shape they should have if

132
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,418
they swell too big they can lyse

133
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:23,680
and if they shrink and shrivel here

134
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:27,129
they're just not going to perform their

135
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,110
proper function this is how they look in

136
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:31,389
real world so we could see a little bit

137
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,860
harder to tell on initial quick look but

138
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,089
I certain sort without and that's how

139
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,000
they should look these are red blood

140
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:39,069
cells RBC's or abbreviation this is how

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,168
they should look we notice in comparison

142
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:43,149
how the properly formed red blood cells

143
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:47,019
look our hypotonic ones are definitely

144
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:49,449
larger definitely plump no real kind of

145
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:52,240
depression in the middle no biconcave

146
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,788
disk actually reducing the surface area

147
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,370
in this case they don't lyse they're

148
00:05:54,788 --> 00:06:00,310
just being a surface here to volume

149
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,360
ratio hypertonic notice that they're

150
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,610
kind of getting this jagged appearance

151
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,800
this jagged appearance is because

152
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,330
they're shrinking they're shrinking down

153
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,240
and that's what's causing the jagged

154
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:11,829
appearance the collapse of the cell yeah

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,329
a lot of waters leading the cell causing

156
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:17,288
it to kind of shrink and shrivel up

157
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:19,259
there here's an example of what's unseen

158
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:21,728
out of the microscope where we have

159
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,529
water exiting the cell causing it to

160
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:24,759
shrink

161
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,319
water entering the cell causing it to

162
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,978
swell and this is how it should look

163
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,728
here

164
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:33,490
so again flipping back our hypotonic is

165
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:36,759
that swelling that be represented is

166
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,930
here here where it's all equal we flip

167
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,420
back that's how they should look at

168
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,780
isotonic

169
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:47,680
and shriveling up would be hypertonic

170
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:51,099
sample here so hypertonic hypotonic an

171
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,610
isotonic key terms to be able to know

172
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,379
and understand plasmolysis is when the

173
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,020
cell loses water in a hypertonic

174
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:01,329
solution so this isn't yet a plant cell

175
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:04,629
looking specifically at the vacuole here

176
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:07,060
that cool here hypotonic all nicely

177
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:10,240
swelled up when I was remanded to that I

178
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,579
sewed a hypertonic here that water is

179
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,199
leaving the cell at a greater rate and

180
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:16,569
we're noticing that vacuole is getting

181
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,329
smaller that's low presented here you're

182
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:21,310
taking up like 90% of the cell here it's

183
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:22,930
a lot less it can even get in the worse

184
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,589
situation what takes up even smaller

185
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:29,530
portion of the cell importantly in our

186
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:31,379
body systems the hydrostatic and

187
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,279
asthmatic pressures and our kidneys

188
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,319
hydrostatic pressure is water pressure

189
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,029
in its filtration that our kidneys go

190
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,649
through and do is passage of water and

191
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:40,750
solutes through membrane through

192
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:43,149
hydrostatic pressure pressure gradient

193
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,360
pushes containing fluid from higher

194
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:47,859
pressure area to lower pressure areas

195
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,780
just a brief overview here the

196
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,420
filtration process if the kidneys go

197
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,819
through is based a lot on this osmotic

198
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,850
pressure this is why it's there's a lot

199
00:07:54,819 --> 00:08:00,909
of folds here a lot of membranes because

200
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,670
we want to excrete down certain waste

201
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,070
products we want to retain some water

202
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:08,470
and some of the things also so the

203
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,790
kidneys throughout all these little

204
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,060
areas here not going to notice the great

205
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,560
details here go through this osmotic

206
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,069
pressure this hydrostatic pressure

207
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,100
buildup water pressure that's occurring

208
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:23,529
allowing us to properly filter our blood

209
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,629
and other fluids to get excrete pure

210
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:27,629
waste products hope that was helpful
