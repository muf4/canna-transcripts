be an example of one provided at the end

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,399

any product someone is interested in

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,320
purchasing

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,320
so first us first off just a description

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,920
of topicals in general

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,840
so topicals are a variety of lotions

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,440
creams infused with cannabinoids they

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,239
can be directly applied and absorbed

30
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,118
through the skin

31
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,239
for medical relief there are different

32
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,159
topical options

33
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,239
and these are just some of the examples

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,520
here if you looked at some other videos

35
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,359
you'll notice the strength of all the

36
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,359
topicals is listed as

37
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,759
medium some of the concentrates are

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,159
listed as high so keep that in mind that

39
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,040
when you're looking at different options

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,680
at the end

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
products of cannabis some categories are

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,560
going to have

43
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,399
just in general have higher strengths

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
more medium or lower strengths

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,439
so again know what effects you're

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,759
looking for and what benefits you're

47
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,359
looking for and search out that category

48
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
of products

49
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,280
now the use of topicals as i said they

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,799
can be applied massage directly into the

51
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,040
skin can be absorbed

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,280
for a medium strength localized relief

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
of pain symptoms as well that's another

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920
option

55
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,078
there now we're talking about our

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,840
topicals just like anything

57
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,919
produced from the cannabis plant we want

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,359
to be mindful of looking at some of the

59
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,960
analytical reports

60
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,478
looking at more than just the

61
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,438
cannabinoids looking at more than just

62
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,438
the terpenes

63
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,279
also making sure they're passing

64
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,000
microbial count

65
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,040
yeast or mold counts chloroform counts e

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
coli

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,239
many different things here we also need

68
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,920
to be mindful of

69
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,439
of making sure our products are passing

70
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,238
that making sure we have the dates

71
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,719
current dates

72
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,319
lot numbers tested as i said a lot of

73
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,680
times this will appear on the label

74
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,519
that's a good thing

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,080
but you're right as a consumer to look

76
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,360
at the label and also access or have the

77
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,080
right to accessing

78
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,879
those actual reports there as we saw

79
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,560
previously

80
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,318
label is a great summary but having an

81
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,080
actual report just ensures

82
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,518
to know where it was tested when it was

83
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,160
tested and make sure the lot numbers

84
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,159
match

85
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,680
and this is part of you just being an

86
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,680
informed consumer
