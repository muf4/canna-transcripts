1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,509
here I'm gonna give the vegetable

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,459
production overview which will hold true

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:07,950
for just about any vegetable crops

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,690
you're looking to grow overall the goals

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,000
to produce high-quality vegetables

6
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:15,388
efficiently planning is important to

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,528
help ensure success of the farm of the

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:21,149
crop and of the vitality of the business

9
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:23,189
so starting with what is farming I'm

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,799
often asked this and this is a pretty

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,629
good idea of what farmers have to deal

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,990
with and something most people can

13
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:32,879
relate to it's the game of tetris and

14
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:35,159
there's always new challenges coming

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,320
down and we're trying to find a way to

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,529
fit them and make them work for our

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,899
given situation we're rewarded then let

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,020
me get a line here and we're constantly

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,058
trying to keep this as low as possible

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,399
even though it seems like problems will

21
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:52,349
keep mounting higher and higher we try

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,350
to find a way to make the puzzle pieces

23
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,399
fit together and keep moving on because

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,260
we know there's gonna be another

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,020
challenge coming right behind the one we

26
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,500
just dealt with so how do we deal with

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,899
this

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,629
well the key part is organization and

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,969
efficiency organization and agency are

30
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:12,109
very important and all walks of life but

31
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:16,109
especially with farming well this is not

32
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:18,629
my tool wall here this is an example of

33
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:21,379
highly organized one and it makes it

34
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:26,280
very efficient standardizing what you do

35
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:28,408
is in your favor and you want us to know

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,310
is what you can so this refers to so

37
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,430
there's certain things it's out of your

38
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,070
control but certain other things that

39
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,259
you are able to control you want to go

40
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,728
through and do that speed quality

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,409
increase you want to decrease the cost

42
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:41,909
here if you've got to grab a certain

43
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,219
size wrench you know right where to go

44
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,009
and get that here the rows are the same

45
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,539
size the same width they have the same

46
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,159
hoops you're not trying to figure out

47
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,799
what hoops go with what row and what

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,259
field makes it a lot more efficient that

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,210
standard the standard a ssin of your

50
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,519
work it makes it a lot easier overall

51
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,828
and the key part if you do get it in

52
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,750
this organized fashion you want to try

53
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:06,029
to return those tools into the same area

54
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,699
so you can maintain that efficiency you

55
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,590
don't want to like this one month and

56
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,829
the next month all these tools being on

57
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,420
a scrap bench over on the side so

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,450
I'm his money I don't think to say that

59
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,339
I've pretty evident there I always say

60
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:22,530
you can get more money from the bank but

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,110
I still have not found a way how to get

62
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,479
more time so you always have to factor

63
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,270
in your time and I know these sunup to

64
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,280
sundown and then some is kind of the

65
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,439
working hours but you've got a factory

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,629
in your time these can't be burning

67
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,430
yourself out certain things that you can

68
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,199
make more efficient and it may cost a

69
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,170
little money initially but it will save

70
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,659
you time in the long mend and planning

71
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:48,539
is one of those steps so it's very

72
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,159
important to plan have a plan but also

73
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,929
try to be prepared for expected or

74
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,969
common issues but still be able to

75
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,409
adjust the changes on the fly so you

76
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,810
want to be able to observe your crop and

77
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,379
kind of take a look at it and document

78
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,209
we'll talk about planning what you see

79
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:05,099
what changes that are occurring you want

80
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,689
to plan for issues so here we see good

81
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,069
weed control we see stakes we see

82
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:10,560
everything pruned right we see

83
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,289
everything trimmed and organized it's

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,459
expected but like a quarterback we still

85
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:16,349
want to be able to come to the line if

86
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,789
we see a defense we didn't expect if we

87
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,129
have an observation that we didn't

88
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:22,500
initially plan for we don't want to be

89
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:25,129
able to make changes preventatively and

90
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,680
that's a key aspect of farming and

91
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:31,019
keeping an idea a plan but being able to

92
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,969
have it not be completely rigid in

93
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,810
adjust to the condition you're seeing at

94
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:38,550
a particular year seeds in general

95
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,800
vegetable don't get cheap on seeds oh

96
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,140
this is a couple senseless systems a

97
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,510
dollar less per pack there might be a

98
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,208
reason I always feel you need to buy the

99
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:49,799
highest quality seeds you can they have

100
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,689
good germination rates typically and

101
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,030
they could have disease resistance or

102
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,650
sometimes multiple teeth disease

103
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,229
resistance which can really help you in

104
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,360
season so try to save a couple dollars

105
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:01,768
here and there on seeds could really

106
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,500
hurt you in the long run if it disease

107
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,750
does to come through and have a buffer

108
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,729
factor I always say don't just buy the

109
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,219
amount of seeds that you need if you

110
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,929
want to have a little bit extra in case

111
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,879
of poor germination rate in case you

112
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,829
have something go wrong in case you have

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,949
a flat that falls over I went up a

114
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,750
couple extras just in case and keep in

115
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:23,399
mind what seeds you are buying in case

116
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,930
you do have success so you can order

117
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,949
those again even though the seed

118
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,670
companies are pretty good about

119
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,189
remembering what you ordered

120
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,780
always good idea just to know for

121
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:34,899
yourself the exact variety that you

122
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:37,839
bought these they've changed use the

123
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:39,279
winter or general offseason to plan it's

124
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,919
kind of hard to plan in the heat of

125
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,479
summer there use that winter that

126
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,920
offseason time when snows on the ground

127
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,680
and everything's frozen up to kind of

128
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,020
make your plan then and in the growing

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,699
season you basically following your plan

130
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,349
so have a plan follow the plan and

131
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,719
you'll be surprised how successful you

132
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,730
can be most people don't have a plan and

133
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,020
that's why it's easy to beat most folks

134
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:03,700
so taking this off season this downtime

135
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:07,659
where there's not as much going on is

136
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:09,430
say in the heat of August or July to

137
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,500
develop that plan what worked what

138
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,889
didn't work what I want to do what do

139
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,740
you think I can do well think this time

140
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,419
to plan and your time is valuable

141
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,129
be sure to factor in the time that you

142
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,520
spend I know you may not want to track

143
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:25,480
the hours to spend per day but remember

144
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,000
the greatest gift you can give someone

145
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,379
is your time because when you give your

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,180
time you're giving a portion of your

147
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,159
lights that you'll never get back so I

148
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,569
know you have this downward spiral here

149
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,090
where it seems like there's just not

150
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:40,120
enough time that they you sure to factor

151
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:42,250
in your time so you don't get burnt out

152
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,259
in season I know it gets tiring at the

153
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,269
end anyway

154
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,579
keep in mind what you're spending your

155
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:51,699
time on and if there's a way to do it

156
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:54,719
more efficiently so you're not quote

157
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,719
wasting your time
