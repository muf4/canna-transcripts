1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,250
okay in this video I tend to at least

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,619
address the question what is biology a

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,050
lot of students do as the study of life

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,929
but then to go much beyond that that's

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,480
really a lot of them get tripped up so

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,789
starting with a biology study of life

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,710
study of living things is a way also to

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,868
look at it and living things can be

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,699
classified into six kingdoms you're

10
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:27,448
probably most familiar with animals

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:31,109
plants maybe even fungi and bacteria but

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,829
there's also protists in archaea as part

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,020
of the total of the six kingdoms so the

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,710
question is well what is life like the

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,940
game of life like cereal there's a

16
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,370
humerus here with you had the egg and

17
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,530
the chicken crawling out of it but how

18
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,949
do we actually define what actually is

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,020
wife

20
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,250
well I've concluded to links to some

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,550
videos here it kind of give you an

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,170
appreciation for what life is and one is

23
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:59,640
duck egg hatching under time-lapse

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,198
another one is a monarch butterfly

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,819
metamorphosis that does occur so what is

26
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,679
life getting back to this central

27
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:09,688
question since biology is the study of

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,780
life we need to think about well what is

29
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:14,819
this what does life mean what does it

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,549
mean to be alive well look at a cell

31
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,798
here we have the individual components

32
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:21,270
cilia the microtubules Golgi apparatus

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,090
so on and so far these are the

34
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:25,978
individual components then we have this

35
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,829
these individual components are

36
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:31,259
organized to result in a behavior so

37
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:34,859
alone the Golgi apparatus the lysosomes

38
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,019
cytoplasm the cell membrane are his

39
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:40,219
components but all of these combined

40
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,420
together result in a behavior and

41
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:45,179
components are organized into this

42
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,009
specific structure so living organisms

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,380
in many nonliving things share three

44
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,290
properties they're complex they

45
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:54,060
typically provide movement and they

46
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,100
response to stimulation so that's that

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,129
getting into that behavior component

48
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,319
there so we see our properties of life

49
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:03,239
there's five main ones all of them

50
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,949
organs for these five basic properties

51
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,228
the first one is cellular organization

52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,959
all organisms are composed in at least

53
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:12,300
one cell so it can be you just one cell

54
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,650
you can see here cells who pose if atoms

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,049
molecules macromolecules

56
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,569
cells cells combined from tissues

57
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,579
tissues can form organs so on and so

58
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:22,828
forth but the one of the key are the

59
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:25,650
five basic properties is cellular

60
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:27,689
organization in the fact that all living

61
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,390
organisms are composed of at least one

62
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:32,818
cell another is that these living

63
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:35,068
organisms that have metabolism what's

64
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:37,649
Mattel ISM we'll all living organisms

65
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,030
use energy you see here we're taking in

66
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,299
in this case chemical energy in the form

67
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,459
of carbohydrates fats proteins we're

68
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:47,879
going to be producing chemical wastes at

69
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,459
carbon dioxide producing heat forming

70
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:52,818
ATP that's resulting in our metabolism

71
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,920
the ability to use and break down energy

72
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:58,858
all of us are able to maintain

73
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,979
homeostasis these are stable internal

74
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:05,010
conditions despite wanting to change

75
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,469
such as blood sugar here being increased

76
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:10,078
or decreased body's trying to maintain a

77
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:12,389
relatively stable environment despite a

78
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:15,120
changing external environment this could

79
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:16,699
be walking from a room that is

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,810
air-conditioned where it's very cold

81
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:20,280
walking outside to where it's very hot

82
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,139
your body's trying to maintain the same

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,098
temperature despite the changing

84
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:29,010
external environment for is all living

85
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:31,378
organisms can grow and reproduce this is

86
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:34,649
we see that here whether it's human

87
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:37,198
whether it's insect able to grow and

88
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,789
reproduce even though the life cycles of

89
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,870
each individual will may be different

90
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:45,840
there is that cycle that does occur and

91
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:49,349
lastly all living organisms possess

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,739
genetic material that is based on DNA

93
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:54,658
the DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid

94
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,759
this is how we're able to inherit

95
00:03:54,658 --> 00:04:00,090
certain genes from our mom or our dad

96
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:03,120
it's through the passed down of the DNA

97
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,239
we're able to track that and it makes us

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,500
essentially who we are so putting this

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,969
all together if you didn't get them all

100
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,318
there at once this is the last kind of

101
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:13,199
summary slide that all living organisms

102
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:16,439
have cellular organization metabolism

103
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:19,439
homeostasis growth in reproduction and

104
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,988
lastly all organisms have some form of

105
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:26,180
heredity hopefully this is helpful in

106
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,179
describing the properties of life
