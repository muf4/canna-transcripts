1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,198
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,599
going to look at

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,119
a study that was done on the response of

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:17,920
cannabis genotypes

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:17,920
related to concentrations of potassium

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,358
all right let's look at responsive

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,198
cannabis genotypes to potassium supply

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,720
so first off the research article that

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,080
i'll be pulling some information from

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,599
presented right here

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,598
welcome to take a look at it in more

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,359
detail to see

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,960
more of the materials and methods that

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,640
they used but i'm going to provide a

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,399
general summary here

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,679
so first off the plant material and this

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,879
is just what they had

18
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:45,280
used two medical cannabis cultivars

19
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,878
genotypes rural medic and desert queen

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
which are approved for commercial

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,000
medical use in israel were used as the

22
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,238
model system

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
in the study presented here both are

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,759
indica have indica characteristics and

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,239
were selected to represent

26
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,960
two distinct chemotypes rm contains

27
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,679
similar concentrations of thc and cbd

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,840
about five percent of each and dq desert

29
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,319
queen has high tea it's a high thc

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
cultivar plants were propagated from

31
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,879
cuttings from a single mother plant and

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,920
coconut fiber

33
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,759
plugs now the growing conditions for

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,560
these plants the plants were divided

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,239
into five

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,159
increasing potassium supply treatments

37
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:26,560
15 60 100 175 and 240 parts per million

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
and grown for 30 days under an 18 6 hour

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,719
light to dark photo period under

40
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,319
metal halide bulbs in a controlled

41
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,400
environment in a growing room

42
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,000
temperatures in growing room were 26 and

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
25 degrees celsius

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,759
for day night temperature and a relative

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,880
humidity of 54 and 50

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,599
respectively irrigation was supplied

47
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,399
via drippers with one dripper per pot

48
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,719
the volume of

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,680
irrigation in each irrigation pulse was

50
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,640
between 250 and 650 milliliters per pot

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
per day

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,718
set to allow 30 of drainage fertilizers

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,719
were supplied by

54
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,798
fertigation dissolved in the nutrient

55
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,158
solution at each irrigation

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,079
so this kind of gives you that great

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,118
background of the research and kind of

58
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,959
the conditions

59
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,159
that they were conducting their research

60
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,959
in and the

61
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,400
article even goes into more detail so

62
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,120
time after potassium treatment let's get

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
to some of the

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,400
results here we're looking at the

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
irrigation in solution and then the

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,760
leachate we're looking at the potassium

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,319
here

68
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,799
on the y-axis and then time after

69
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,560
treatment in days on the x-axis

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
and overall we can see an irrigation

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,680
solution the potassium stayed

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,200
relatively consistent as we would expect

73
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,920
and the leachate here

74
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,598
for the higher concentrations increased

75
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:41,280
over time

76
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:44,318
and that's basically in the 175 and the

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,840
240 parts per million treatments now the

78
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,759
potassium concentration the little

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,000
brackets here mean concentration

80
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,199
on the leaf so we're looking at here

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,598
kind of our leaves

82
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,518
are two different varieties and

83
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,639
potassium concentrations of 15

84
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,200
60 100 175 and 240 that changes

85
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,719
noticeably in their morphology images of

86
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,759
the youngest fully developed lee on the

87
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,039
main stem taken

88
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,840
26 days after the initiation

89
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,199
of the fertigation regime and we could

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,519
see that definitely the

91
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,958
low reading here definitely had a

92
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
different morphology but as we get to

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,158
the higher readings

94
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,239
a little harder to make a distinguishing

95
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,919
factor based on visual characteristics

96
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
between the various treatments and

97
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,759
concentrations given

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,439
so let's look at the potassium on the

99
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,679
overall plant development

100
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,840
and this is photographed 26 days after

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,280
the initiation of fertigation regime

102
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,640
much like we saw with the leaf

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,560
but now we're looking at the entire

104
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,039
plant still those 15

105
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
uh concentration per million definitely

106
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,919
suffering

107
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,839
higher levels a little harder to tell a

108
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,559
difference at least based on purely

109
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,719
visual characteristics so what were the

110
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,640
general results were they looking at

111
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,158
well 15 parchment of potassium was

112
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,000
insufficient for optimum growth and

113
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,679
function in both genotypes and elicit

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
visual deficiency symptoms

115
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,120
that we could clearly see on the images

116
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,640
provided 240 uh parchment of potassium

117
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,158
proved excessive and damaging to

118
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,359
development of genotypes

119
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:10,079
royal medic while desert queen it's

120
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
simulated rather than restricted shoot

121
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,760
and

122
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,079
root development so for the

123
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,599
royal medic the growth positive response

124
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,519
to increased potassium supply

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,120
up to 175 parts per million of potassium

126
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,959
increasing in leaves and root biomass

127
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,439
the stem diameter and internode

128
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,959
elongation rate but increased was

129
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,879
further

130
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,359
but decreased with further increasing to

131
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,600
that 240 parts per million of potassium

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,800
rendering 175 the optimum concentration

133
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,439
for this genotype

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,639
this is important to realize that adding

135
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,160
more fertilizer

136
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
in some cases once you get above that

137
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,680
optimum level will lead to a decrease

138
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,239
in your plant performance so for the

139
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,240
desert queen increasing potassium supply

140
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
in the range of 60 to 175 parts per

141
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
million

142
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,240
did not affect plant development

143
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,079
surprisingly further increasing case

144
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,079
supply to level of 240

145
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,120
stimulated rather than restricted growth

146
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,038
and development in this

147
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,399
genotype so this is again where you're

148
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,000
looking at different genotypes you can

149
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,758
have different fertilizer requirements

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,600
to maximize that growth

151
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,120
having these studies is great to be able

152
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,439
to act as a comparison

153
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,680
to be able to look at potentially some

154
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,360
varieties that you might be considering

155
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,959
i put here just soil test potassium

156
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
recommended potassium levels just in

157
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,120
general might be recommended

158
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,160
but here we're seeing a dialed into a

159
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,280
nutrient-specific

160
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,120
regime based on actual varieties

161
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,399
so take this into consideration if

162
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,319
you're not growing one of these

163
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,319
it looks like kind of i would say not

164
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,360
going over that 175 would be a good

165
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,839
starting point

166
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,840
and then see how the plants respond
