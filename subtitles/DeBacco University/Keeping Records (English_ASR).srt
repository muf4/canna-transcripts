1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,600
okay here I'm gonna go over something

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,669
that I think it's overlooked by a lot of

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,500
growers and it's simple factor of

4
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:09,599
keeping records now they don't have to

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,490
be this larger this extensive but this

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,548
is more important than most growers

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,379
realize the systems variable not every

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,750
farmer takes the records exactly the

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,010
same way but the key part is that you

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,079
have something that you actually will do

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,480
some form or some method actually

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,219
documenting what occurred in maintaining

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,469
those records so that you can refer back

14
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:33,929
to them in the future

15
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:36,509
so obvious question is just well why

16
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:37,979
should I keep records what's the point

17
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:39,869
and a good year you want to know what

18
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,578
you did so something worked out really

19
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:42,750
good and I'd say you kind of want to

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,299
have those records so you can repeat

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,730
that pattern in future years however in

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,649
a bad year you also know will want to

23
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,169
know what you did because you want to

24
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,270
know why didn't it work or why in

25
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,410
hindsight look at a decision I made or

26
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,690
something that occurred I didn't react

27
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,279
to quick enough so it's also beneficial

28
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,468
then so you can see whether you have a

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,409
good year or a bad year keeping records

30
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,989
is important and even though a year to

31
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,670
some things you can't control 100% but

32
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:13,438
you just want to know what happened and

33
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,090
potentially why that occurred so what do

34
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,399
I keep records of well there's no right

35
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,909
or wrong answer to this but why focus on

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,439
a few important items or crops soil

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,080
testing is an excellent record to keep

38
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:28,319
and maintain for each field planting

39
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,728
dates that could be started in the field

40
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,769
that could be started in the greenhouse

41
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:35,700
that could be transplant dates sins like

42
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:37,949
that and also in general each crop has

43
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,710
its own unique qualities but when it

44
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,930
went into flower one day I noticed fruit

45
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,030
set when I see insects and disease

46
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,130
sightings start to increase what are my

47
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,618
harvest dates for my yields on the field

48
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:51,868
again a lot of things you can

49
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,310
potentially keep track of you want to

50
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:55,019
focus on a few that you're actually

51
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,899
going to do and it will provide you

52
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:59,310
information in the future internet some

53
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,140
disease scouting you know about when a

54
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,030
disease came in one year so you can be

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,159
ready for and prepare for the following

56
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,750
year when was fruit set one was

57
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,300
flowering how does it relate to harvest

58
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,300
date how many days after how many weeks

59
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,010
after did that occur it can be important

60
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,989
for your clients or your

61
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,090
csa your people asking when you're gonna

62
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,158
have X Y or Z you can give them a better

63
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,900
idea years to come when you see that

64
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:23,489
flowering you know oh it's gonna be two

65
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,219
weeks to me three weeks then I should

66
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,450
have something for you how do I keep

67
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,128
records a question I get asked a lot

68
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,589
well you want to label the fields with

69
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:33,810
the name that's logical to you I don't

70
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,729
care what you call the fields I'll call

71
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,378
them quote whatever you call them you

72
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:39,509
want to keep the name independent of the

73
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:40,949
crop so you don't want to call this the

74
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,500
sunflower field because this year you

75
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:45,238
grew sunflowers and next year will be

76
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,039
tomatoes or corn and you're like oh the

77
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,140
sunflower field yeah they want the corn

78
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,519
on it now try to get away from calling

79
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,848
it with the crop that's grown on it

80
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:58,340
called the name next to the hillside you

81
00:02:53,848 --> 00:03:00,899
know the level field the rocky field the

82
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,729
next to Grandma's house whatever works

83
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,250
for you it's not a problem as long as

84
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,328
you know what that relates to and you

85
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,340
can break up your fields as small as

86
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:10,230
possible here a nice level area well

87
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,120
here you have different fields keep the

88
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:14,009
name independent of the crop and label

89
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,439
it something logical you call it North

90
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,878
one north to north three that works too

91
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,469
you don't to get fancier creative with

92
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:21,030
their names but get away from calm buy

93
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:22,469
the crop because ideally he'll be

94
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,139
rotating and that might confuse you in

95
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,579
future years as weather important to

96
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,799
keep track of weather should be

97
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,500
documented I feel in some way individual

98
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,969
weather stations you could have are an

99
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,370
option you can use some public sources

100
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:36,629
that are probably close enough I want to

101
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,489
find a station that's close to you

102
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,680
whether you're in the hills or the

103
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,109
valley or near the shore or anywhere in

104
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,219
between you want to have an area that's

105
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:46,319
close to you still be a little

106
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:48,689
microclimate set develop and just gives

107
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,888
you a general idea and if it rains well

108
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,539
how much rain you could have a simple

109
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:52,769
rain gauge something like that just so

110
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,608
you have some sort of documentation

111
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:58,889
temperature fluctuations highs and lows

112
00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:00,569
Weather Channel provides some data some

113
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,700
Weather Underground some other web sites

114
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:03,869
that are great at just documenting what

115
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,929
the weather is and just have a way to

116
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,669
document and save that for you so a

117
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,319
suggestion do I have what do I use to

118
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:12,030
keep track records well one

119
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,560
recommendation is use a slideshow format

120
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,750
which makes it easy to import pictures

121
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,728
and the title Connect is the Dayton

122
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,139
stand like a PowerPoint here written

123
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:21,120
notes work also you can type those right

124
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,519
in there so what system I use I use a

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,050
PowerPoint or a slideshow system I find

126
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,569
it really easy for pictures which are

127
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,000
important really to put dates in drop

128
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:32,490
a couple notes and move on to the next

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,699
slide for different fields I could have

130
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,620
different powerpoints it allows me to go

131
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,909
back and dial in and really focus in on

132
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,639
what may have occurred in that that

133
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,070
region again and since that works for me

134
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,870
do you have to use this no I do a lot of

135
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:47,250
powerpoints what would I like about it

136
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,560
it's really easy to put pictures in

137
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,959
which are important and as I said

138
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,180
pictures are highly recommended because

139
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,419
even though you're taking a picture of X

140
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,819
later you may be more interested in Y so

141
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,520
while you look at this picture if you

142
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,759
see the older woman or the two guys in a

143
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:08,339
horse something that you may see

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,319
originally may get changed

145
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:12,269
you might be looking at the tomatoes but

146
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,399
later when you look back you might be

147
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:16,709
looking at Oh what weeds are coming in

148
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,389
or what did the leaves look like or what

149
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:21,089
does that thing behind it or other

150
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:23,250
things it's amazing what a picture can

151
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:26,339
tell you looking back with fresh eyes on

152
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,709
it an example here do you see the older

153
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,959
man's face here there's his nose and

154
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:33,120
mustache you see the young lady's back

155
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,889
here here's her nose her eyes and this

156
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,110
would be her ear this would be her hair

157
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,279
there so as I said those pictures

158
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,199
because you might see something

159
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,869
initially you might be fur back to them

160
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,279
it might be different should I take

161
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,139
written notes written notes can be quick

162
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,799
and easy field notes quick little thing

163
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,060
all right on your phone real quick

164
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,340
whiteboard works too but be careful

165
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,069
these can get erased and if they get wet

166
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,139
or rain or water they're gonna run good

167
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:59,399
for quick little notes sometimes if your

168
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,509
workers have something to jot down or

169
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,069
something they see could have a little

170
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,810
board dedicated to that that's great

171
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:05,849
quick little field notes there's

172
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,920
something quick easy what did you see

173
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,290
what you need to document all good

174
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,650
options in just in some way of taking

175
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,510
notes a last important point determine a

176
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:17,969
format on that you'll actually do

177
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,430
provide helpful information looking back

178
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,380
and will keep yourself organized however

179
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,889
you want to organize it with a crop or

180
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:28,139
by field what you see you could do look

181
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,599
at the fruit look at the leaves and

182
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,430
other look at insects you just want to

183
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,110
have some sort of format it'll keep you

184
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,910
better in tuned with did I miss

185
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,860
something or did I make sure I write

186
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,419
down everything they're on that I need

187
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,490
to see and again they don't have to be

188
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:44,068
long quick little notes

189
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,240
I do want the whole goal is to be able

190
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,189
to have something to refer back to

191
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,120
during the offseasons you can better

192
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,120
plan for the next year
