1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
okay human reversing steps to prepare

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,378
for harvest so just like cooking it's

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:08,939
not about kind of the end product in

4
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:10,468
order to have a quality end product

5
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,629
there's a lot of preparation that goes

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:16,649
into that there are some of that here

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,420
for cannabis production so harvest plant

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,849
about preparations you want to reduce

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,949
fertilizer applications about one to two

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,840
weeks before harvest and then stop

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,050
fertilizer applications about one week

12
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,660
or less before harvest help avoid native

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,880
taste in aromas that could build up in

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,710
the buds for example now if you're

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,480
playing the line really close you're not

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,870
really over fertilizing you don't have

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,039
to necessarily stop this far in advance

18
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:43,140
which is good to kind of flush that plan

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,149
out to get it rid of any excess buildup

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,739
that you may have also if you're

21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,399
applying anything on the leaves with

22
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:52,859
foliar applications you want to stop

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,689
these before you harvest as this may

24
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,698
cause unwanted residues on the finished

25
00:00:54,689 --> 00:01:01,049
product of the plant so while they may

26
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:02,488
be helpful to your plant by applying

27
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,259
them right up to harvest and getting

28
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,239
kind of the bud sprayed that can cause

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,030
some negative impacts with residues

30
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,769
remaining and preparing for harvest

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,960
flushing your plants involves adding

32
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:16,469
water to remove excess buildup of salts

33
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,298
and fertilizers this can be done about

34
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,950
one week before the planned harvest or

35
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,320
two weeks again depending on what media

36
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,689
you may be using using hydroponics you

37
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,298
can cut this window down losing soil are

38
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:29,399
much larger mineral based material you

39
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,530
might want to go on that one one and a

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,939
half maybe even two weeks out the goals

41
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,950
that water drain out of the containers

42
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:36,779
or flush through the root zone to

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,439
provide a place for excess salts to go

44
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,430
and be removed from that root zone so

45
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,809
flushing is different than just watering

46
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,460
the plant watering we're trying to keep

47
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,519
that water contained to the root zone

48
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,530
flushing here you're trying to get those

49
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:51,298
contents beyond the root zone out of the

50
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,920
plant's reach containers it's really

51
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,780
easy you look for water drain out in

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,368
soil base conditions field-based

53
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,810
wanna make sure you're excessively water

54
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:01,379
and to kind of get that to Train below

55
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,519
that root zone some indoor growers will

56
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,500
turn the lights off one to two days

57
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,298
before harvest what they believe helps

58
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,680
increase a resin production however

59
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,810
there's no supporting evidence to this

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,239
other than anecdotal information so just

61
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,740
keep that in mind there personally just

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,599
run the lights right up to the end

63
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,730
and I think you're all the same amount

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,500
of resin production over stressing the

65
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:22,500
lights over stressing the plants with no

66
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,120
lights might be unneeded now pre-harvest

67
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,099
pruning a day before harvest you can

68
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,900
remove large leaves and stems to better

69
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,509
expose the buds to make the next day's

70
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,129
process that much easier keep in mind it

71
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,689
is important to discard the plant

72
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:35,219
material and keep the area clean

73
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:36,389
don't just prune off the leaves and let

74
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,359
them sit there because it will dry out

75
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:41,549
you want to remove that from the grow

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,230
area and if you're cutting leaves very

77
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,630
close to the buds you may want to save

78
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,099
those as part of a drying process you

79
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,139
can start that here and date early

80
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,389
before you remove the actual buds from

81
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,759
the plant but again the important part

82
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:55,529
is to just remove that from the area so

83
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,379
you're not getting dried buds and dried

84
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,050
flowers within the branches that you

85
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,120
have here to make the harvest process a

86
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:07,550
little bit more efficient with a good

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,550
preparation procedure that you do follow
