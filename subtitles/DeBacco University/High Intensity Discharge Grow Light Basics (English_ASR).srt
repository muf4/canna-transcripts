1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
hiren look as the high-intensity

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:08,490
discharge pro-lite basics typically

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:10,740
abbreviated hid on lights they're just

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,539
the basics here we can consider cannabis

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,730
plant here under high-intensity light

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,759
probably a high-pressure sodium looking

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,649
at just kind of a yellow tint so

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,439
high-intensity discharge lights are HID

9
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:24,719
lights the basic types these are used to

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,460
try and replicate the natural sunlight

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,509
there's many different subcategories

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,520
such as mercury vapor HTS from mercury

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,890
vapor metal halide or high pressure

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,809
sodium and conversion bulbs two most

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,128
common you'll find our metal halide

16
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,308
which will tend have a more of a wider

17
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:42,689
look to the to the light spectrum and

18
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:46,109
HPS or high pressure sodium to have more

19
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,549
that yellow appearance these HID lights

20
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:49,259
and the suggested coverage area

21
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,058
depending on the wattage of bulb you're

22
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,710
using will depend on Natalie the

23
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,439
coverage area about how far away from

24
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,628
the foliage it should be a 400 watt

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,570
covers a 3x3 area and should be kept

26
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:02,039
about one or two feet above the foliage

27
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,689
600 watt covers a four by four area

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,040
effectively and should be about a foot

29
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:07,769
and a half to two feet away from the

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,118
foliage a thousand watt covers a five by

31
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:10,709
five air and should be kept about two

32
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,390
feet away from the foliage the

33
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,728
manufacturers will often state greater

34
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,368
areas and what's quoted above but this

35
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:19,408
is assuming dense plants for maximum

36
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,509
yield soak another thousand watt to a

37
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,368
six by six probably but not really

38
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,069
effectively it covers a five by five

39
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:28,920
area very effectively and that's what I

40
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:30,899
recommend here high-intensity discharge

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,728
lights the popular waters are four six

42
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,650
and thousand Watts thousand watts

43
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:36,269
trigger to the standards which allows

44
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,490
for the greatest coverage areas we just

45
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:40,548
saw here's a bunch of lights here all

46
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:44,728
thousand watt double-ended kavita pros

47
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:46,680
for this particular grow facility how do

48
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,929
they work well they produce light by

49
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,090
pressing electricity through a vaporized

50
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,520
gas and a seal tube under high pressure

51
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,409
on the mix of sevens is in the vapor

52
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,478
allow for different spectrums to be

53
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,000
produced and there are a few light bulb

54
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,310
manufacturers but odds are you pay for

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,680
what you get so higher price bulbs well

56
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,030
I can produce a better spectrum so it's

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,399
it's important not to go for the

58
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,689
cheapest light I you're trying to look

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,250
for when that's going to produce the

60
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,219
greatest spectrum because that could

61
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,599
have a large impact on

62
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:16,599
or total and yield
