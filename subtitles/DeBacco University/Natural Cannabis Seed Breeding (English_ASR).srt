00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,559
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,278
we're going to go over the natural

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,558
cannabis seed breeding process here

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,160
uh kind of walk you through some of the

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,439
basic steps if you're not familiar with

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,638
seed reading in general

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,359
just to kind of give you a general

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,030
healing on how it naturally occurs here

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:25,289
on tobacco university

[Music]

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,439
all right let's get into the video here

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,118
well first off to have a proper breeding

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,520
process you need to have

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,280
male and female plants so growing both

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,600
male and female plants at the same time

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
can allow for the production of seeds

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,520
and keep in mind female plants are going

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,599
to look like the ones down

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
over in this area and the male plants

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,719
are going to look like the kind of

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,558
flowers there so it's important to be

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,920
able to identify a male in the female

23
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,238
plant as well

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,679
and keep them generally isolated and we

25
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,558
want to be careful with the male plants

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,920
particularly for growing for

27
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,519
cannabinoids and terpenes

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,359
because they can pollinate plants we may

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,199
not want to be pollinated vastly

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,480
reducing our cannabinoids and terpenes

31
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,438
produced

32
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,438
so focusing first on those male plants

33
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,199
well male plants typically mature before

34
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:09,919
female plants to help ensure that pollen

35
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
will be ready

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,079
as the female matures pollen is wind

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
transferred so often there can be a lot

38
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,400
of pollen produced and it's very fine

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,239
pollen at that for indoor operations the

40
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,280
pond can get into ventilation systems so

41
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,039
be mindful of that

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,200
and for outdoor locations the pond can

43
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,560
travel from one field to another

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
so you want to keep that in mind with

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,359
your indoor outdoor growing if you are

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,719
producing male plants or neighbors

47
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,280
producing male plants

48
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,400
be aware of the distance that pollen can

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,680
travel

50
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,320
now for female plants pollinating them

51
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,640
will cause

52
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,719
a shift in the plant's energy from

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,040
cannabinoids to seeds

54
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,879
and as a result that shift that will

55
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,600
reduce that production of the cannabis

56
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,000
and terpenes

57
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,199
that we may be seeking or may have grown

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,040
that plant for

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,320
so keep that in mind you can't get the

60
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
ink at everything

61
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,519
you can't get seeds and high

62
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,879
cannabinoids you can get one or the

63
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,478
other

64
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,239
now this comes down a lot in breeding it

65
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,239
comes down to timing

66
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,158
so ensuring both the male and female

67
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,920
plants need to be at the same stage of

68
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,360
development to increase the odds of a

69
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,280
successful pollination

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
for indoor applications this can be

71
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,000
potentially achieved by a photo period

72
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
adjustment

73
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,479
and for outdoor grows this can be just a

74
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
timing when you're seeding

75
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,840
those plants when the natural photo

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,360
period will change as well to ensure you

77
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,319
have a plan of large enough structure

78
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,440
to be able to support and produce high

79
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,359
quality and high

80
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,959
qual quantity and quality seeds

81
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,720
so keep in mind also that when we're

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,239
looking at seeds there are often

83
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,598
different strains that we bred together

84
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,000
to create a hybrid

85
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,518
with the intention to get the best of

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,479
both original plants

87
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,039
in one this result in offsprings that

88
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,840
will have

89
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,280
increased variability so this may be

90
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,159
different traits

91
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,919
for example desired plant morphology and

92
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,199
preferred chemical profile could be a

93
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,958
great combination

94
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,399
auto flying a preferred chemical profile

95
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,479
is another thing that a lot of

96
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,800
growers are trying to breed for in the

97
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,359
sense that they're selecting certain

98
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,319
pollen isolating certain females growing

99
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,280
certain strains

100
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,839
to kind of get this best of both worlds

101
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,360
into

102
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
one plant they can call their own

103
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
ideally now

104
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,479
remember that the theoretical does not

105
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,479
always equal

106
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,158
the observed so just because you make a

107
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,518
cross and are expecting something and

108
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,959
theoretically that should happen

109
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,560
that doesn't always mean that's what's

110
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,200
going to happen sometimes you get what

111
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,959
you want

112
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,719
other times it just simply doesn't work

113
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,158
out if you have a tall plant with a

114
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,239
great chemical profile and a plant

115
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,318
that's short with poor chemical profile

116
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,920
and you cross the two you might get a

117
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,518
short short plant with great chemical

118
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,958
profile which would be excellent for

119
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,920
indoor growing operations particularly

120
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,200
grow tents

121
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,119
but keep in mind you could also get a

122
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,039
tall plant with poor chemical profile

123
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,519
which isn't going to make anyone happy

124
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,959
the key is growing as many many plants

125
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,239
and then selecting the ones with the

126
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,280
desired traits

127
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,640
that you as a grower deem desirable

128
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,840
hopefully that gives you a quick little

129
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:01,839
overview here of how to breed cannabis

130
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
natural cannabis breeding in general
