1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,040
on this debacco University video we'll

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:07,318
be learning about what UV light is and

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,199
looking at some data that it has on the

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:13,500
impact on tpine production through this

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:16,559
collaboration with Shane from

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,559
[Music]

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,198
migro welcome again Shane from mro here

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:27,038
we are discussing a light in different

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,560
wavelengths uh we've talked about kind

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,560
of in the middle we've talked about par

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,640
we've talked about blue red

12
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,640
green wavelengths of light also have

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,039
another video on Far red which is one

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,960
end of the spectrum now we're going to

15
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,238
go to kind of the other end of the

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,840
electro magnetic Spectrum talking about

17
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:45,839
UV light now with UV light we've got the

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,239
breakdown of UVA and UVB and we're going

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,039
to kind of see can we disain anything

20
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,238
about you know how it might affect uh

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,960
plant growth how do plants kind of

22
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:58,078
utilize um these uh kind of looking at

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,439
that far end you know one spectrum that

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,120
far red well now this this this have any

25
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,438
counteracting effects or when we're

26
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,719
looking at UV light how may this change

27
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,079
our morphology because we may see it in

28
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,400
some lights that we're looking at

29
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,478
purchasing so Shane looking at our uh

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,200
UVA UVB lights how's this impacting um

31
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:17,079
plant growth what can Growers kind of

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,400
expect for these different wavelengths

33
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:24,519
to impact their particular plants yeah

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,640
so UVA is um lower wavelength than blue

35
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:31,478
it's really a deep blue just about

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:35,519
visible um you see a UV a LED you might

37
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:39,158
see sort of a a deep blue glow from it

38
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:42,759
but barely in the visible range um UVA

39
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:45,359
is um emitted by the sun H it's it's

40
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,920
available to use by plants H it's

41
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,039
somewhat photosynthetic although not as

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,960
as as photosynthetic as blue um and as

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,360
you go into the lower wavelength becomes

44
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,718
less photosynthetically active um blue

45
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,640
in terms of plant respon sorry UVA in

46
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,798
terms of plant response is very similar

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,879
to Blue in that increased proportions of

48
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:11,959
UVA in the plan Spectrum will um lead to

49
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:16,439
Shorter more dense growth up to point um

50
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:18,640
UVA is uh is is not considered to be

51
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,159
beneficial in in many other ways there

52
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,919
are studies uh around the theories bound

53
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,199
but I haven't seen any

54
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,318
practical um demonstration or

55
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,639
experiments demonstrating that there's

56
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:35,439
any other benefit of using UV UVA in

57
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:38,559
terms of cannabis growth separately then

58
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:41,039
UVB which is lower down on the Spectrum

59
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,640
UV or sorry low lower down in terms of

60
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,280
wavelengths shorter wavelength but

61
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:50,079
higher energy um we know this because

62
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,800
UVB causes um sunburn you know it can it

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,040
it has high energy photons which can

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,920
basically can damage um cells and so in

65
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,439
terms of our cells we get sunburnt in

66
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,238
terms of plants

67
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,959
um it can reduce growth rate and because

68
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,959
um it can damage the plants um but it

69
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:12,120
can also stimulate a response from the

70
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:15,239
plants there are theories that um that

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,360
UVB will contribute to increased oil

72
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,080
production the so-called Sun sunscreen

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,799
response um there is some evidence to

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,680
support this so for example if you talk

75
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,280
to Herb Growers you know that there's

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,438
there's considered to be a qualitative

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,280
difference and for example Rosemary if

78
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:35,280
it's grown in the sun rather than in the

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,919
greenhouse you get more pungent sticky

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,039
Aroma um and there are some studies uh

81
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,000
for very limited with with regard to

82
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,318
cannabis that you can get that effect

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,239
also um the theory being that you'd

84
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:51,919
apply UVB to the plant when flowering

85
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,799
and as I said you get an increase not in

86
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,479
cannaboids uh but an increase in oil

87
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,280
production which would be Turpin and

88
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,798
flavonoid so more flavor and taste

89
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,878
yeah and thanks for mentioning the uh

90
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,959
you know specifics of timing potentially

91
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:07,399
of this and how that may be beneficial

92
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,360
now some manufacturers are producing

93
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,039
specific lights for uh UVB in particular

94
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,840
you know as you mentioned they you know

95
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:16,399
more towards that end that tpine that

96
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,600
final kind of finishing where might be

97
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,358
more important now is this something

98
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,879
should be filtering out maybe early in

99
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,918
this in the season is something that you

100
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:25,399
would look at modifying in any certain

101
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,599
way any recommendations you would give

102
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,959
to Growers just use it at the end and

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,160
does it really matter at the because

104
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,478
we're looking at

105
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,039
uh blue light UV light um is this

106
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,758
something grower should be concerned

107
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:37,599
about the entire grow or should it

108
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,520
really be focused on in that later

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,759
stages if at all yeah so UVB or UVA to

110
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,198
start with is is is produced um is not

111
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,919
produced by by grow lighting or standard

112
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,960
grow light so if we're using white LED

113
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:56,359
lights for example even using metal Hy

114
00:04:52,959 --> 00:05:00,399
and high pressure sodium very limited

115
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:03,600
output of UVA U from from those lighting

116
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:07,000
Technologies um so but some Growers

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,439
choose to supplement uh that Spectrum

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,439
with with perhaps UVA diodes um and as I

119
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,639
said that might be might be producing a

120
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,519
small amount of UVA radiation um that's

121
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,000
it's it's likely to contribute a little

122
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,318
bit to photosynthesis but unlikely to

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,399
change the quality of the Harvest that

124
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,639
you get and

125
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:30,918
UVB in the up up to now has only really

126
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:33,199
been available um using Essence so you

127
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:37,079
think of your typical use would be in um

128
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,319
you know sunbeds or um reptile bulbs and

129
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,560
they are quite an efficient uh source of

130
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,680
ubb photons U and they can be used as a

131
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,879
supplemental light to your to your LED

132
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,439
light um there is an improvement in the

133
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,439
um UVB LED technology so they're

134
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,759
becoming more efficient they're becoming

135
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,800
more cost

136
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,720
effective um and there are studies uh

137
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,160
that are underway I know from speaking

138
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,840
to to a college recently that they're

139
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,599
looking at discret bands the the effect

140
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:14,159
of discret bands of UVB uh on the

141
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:16,399
turpine profile for example for example

142
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,000
of plant so there's plent to be be

143
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,679
looked at there there's research to be

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,079
done and I'm sure there'll be um

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,959
learnings that will come out over the

146
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,000
coming

147
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,959
years thank you for giving us that

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,038
little uh teaser insight to what we

149
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,959
might be seeing in the future and the

150
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,918
fact that just because we can produce it

151
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:35,279
or can add it it may not have necessary

152
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:38,198
effects on plant growth so it's kind of

153
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,799
that technology versus morphology of the

154
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,280
plant and kind of what the plant can

155
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,759
actually utilize um and this just kind

156
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,559
of adds to our understanding of just

157
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,680
what the plants can utilize even though

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,560
they might be exposed to a lot and look

159
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,959
forward to hearing potentially on that

160
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,038
research or those Publications on what

161
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,878
might be coming forward as we learn more

162
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:01,038
about this particular wavelength there U

163
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,120
that the plants can be exposed to

164
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,318
thank you again Shane for uh everything

165
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
here and uh further insight into our

166
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,919
ever expanding knowledge of the ever

167
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,918
