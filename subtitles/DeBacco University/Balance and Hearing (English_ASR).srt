1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,209
here we're gonna look at the balance and

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:08,250
hearing sensory receptors starting with

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:11,039
hearing but not from a human standpoint

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,048
but from a fish's standpoint fish have a

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,968
lateral line this is how they this is

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:16,410
their sense of hearing they're able to

7
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,379
sense objects that reflect pressure

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,550
waves in low-frequency vibrations this

9
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,649
red line shows where they might be

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,410
located in this shark we see this

11
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,089
distinctive line here on this fish now

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,528
on this fish the striped bass you might

13
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:30,178
be initially think there's multiple

14
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,520
lateral lines but there's technically

15
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:34,799
only one if you look very closely at

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,469
this line here the darker line is

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,718
actually the lateral line so special

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,420
only has one lateral line despite many

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,399
stripes this is a striped bass caught in

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,280
the Connecticut River after launching

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,879
from the Rocky Hill boat ramp now

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,640
continuing on in fish under other skin

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,140
they have these canals that have sensory

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,230
structures containing hair cells

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,320
directing into a gelatinous cube kula

26
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:03,390
these vibrations produce movements and

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,478
hair cells bend in depolarize

28
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,799
associated with sensory neurons so we

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,539
see here the events that it's moving

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,430
back and forth and you see that's all

31
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,159
kind of attached all these different

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,439
nerve fibers this is how the fish is

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,900
able to sense these pressure vibrations

34
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,149
through the movement of this cupola and

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,189
a little bit more intensive an image

36
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,228
here you see how it's kind of organizing

37
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:27,269
all these different sensing outer hair

38
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:29,400
cells and it's this movement back and

39
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,709
forth of these low pressure waves that's

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,228
being interpreted by the fish and that's

41
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:37,859
their sense of hearing without having a

42
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:41,188
distinctive ear like we do now in humans

43
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,590
sensation of gravity in motion so maybe

44
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,539
one reliance is located here we're

45
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,189
talking about hearing in ears well it's

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,490
very important because your sense of

47
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,048
balance is related to your inner ear so

48
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:53,819
those receptors in the ear that informed

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,860
the brain where the body is in three

50
00:01:53,819 --> 00:02:00,618
dimensions gravity is detected by the

51
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:03,180
shifting boat oullette sensory cells and

52
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:05,489
these are located in a gelatin like

53
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,799
matrix and they're composed of your

54
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:10,169
inner ear so the force of gravity is

55
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,780
what's causing them to move tilt your

56
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,739
head forward gravity is pushing them all

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,509
down and that's

58
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,550
your sense of where you are in

59
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:19,709
three-dimensional space so your ability

60
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,480
to walk as a youngster it's actually

61
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,879
dependent on development of your inner

62
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,209
ear so you're able to sense three

63
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,609
dimensions so that helps you be able to

64
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:33,480
maintain your balance and this is the

65
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,680
reason why the motion so balanced the

66
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,689
psycho motion if you tilt your head

67
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,879
forward the force of gravity moves well

68
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,340
motion is detected by the deflection of

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,949
these hair cells by fluid in a direction

70
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,629
opposite of that motion so that

71
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:48,419
acceleration standpoint they're going to

72
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,639
go the opposite way these hair cells are

73
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:54,000
found in the cupula inner tent like

74
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,369
assemblies in three semicircular canals

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,979
so a very similar structure to the fish

76
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,379
also using sensory receptors in hairs

77
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:04,079
here we're just using it now to detect

78
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:07,769
motion and this is kind of related here

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,950
of acceleration at rest or deceleration

80
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,930
eyes all sense of motion based on the

81
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:14,759
movement of these hair cells in

82
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,580
three-dimensional space near bodies

83
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,439
perception of those now properties of

84
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,120
sound / sound is simply a pressure

85
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,189
disturbance altering areas of high and

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,930
low pressure originating from a

87
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,629
vibrating object here we see a tuning

88
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,849
fork composed of areas of refraction and

89
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:32,490
compression represented by a sine wave

90
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,889
here in a wave length which is the

91
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:38,640
distance between two consecutive waves

92
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:41,579
either two consecutive peaks here would

93
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,729
be two consecutive troughs any frequency

94
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,790
is a number of waves that pass point per

95
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:49,919
unit of time in the amplitude here is a

96
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:52,679
distance between the origin and the

97
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,799
crest or it could be the origin and the

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,180
trough that would be the amplitude the

99
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,270
speed is simply wavelength times

100
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,620
frequency now frequency is the number of

101
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,219
waves that pass forgivin

102
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,500
point at a given time and pitch is the

103
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:10,280
perception of different frequencies we

104
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,750
hear basically from 22 if you're lucky

105
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,400
20,000 Hertz it's determined by

106
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,430
different frequencies kind different

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,048
parts of the membrane to vibrate

108
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,370
different sensory neurons are fired and

109
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,399
this is how you're able to determine

110
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,009
different pitches now amplitude is the

111
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,909
intensity of the sound measured in

112
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:29,279
Phoebe's that

113
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,580
fools and loudness is subjective

114
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:35,159
interpretation of these sound intensity

115
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:37,519
relates to how often neurons fire so for

116
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,050
sound waves wave corresponds to pitch

117
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,680
amplitude of the wave corresponds to the

118
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,230
volume the sound wave shown with the

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,019
dashed line is softer in volume than the

120
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,720
salvation with this solid line so here

121
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,909
we're looking at our volume in

122
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,840
comparison so you notice it's basically

123
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:00,030
the same same pitch same kind of

124
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,459
different amplitude same wavelength that

125
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:05,219
I should say our different amplitudes

126
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,769
here but our wavelengths remain the same

127
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,290
and we see here the kind of small

128
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:14,819
talking call yet bird we see the very

129
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:18,180
angry large large bird here indicating

130
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,469
that difference in our amplitude even

131
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,280
though our wavelengths are actually

132
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:26,070
remaining the same consuming ayman sound

133
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,559
is heard air vibration is detected it is

134
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:30,269
a tickling in your eardrum your eardrum

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,459
is a membrane that's pushed in and out

136
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:35,099
by waves of pressure and there's three

137
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:37,169
small bones ossicles are the bones of a

138
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,220
located on the other side of the eardrum

139
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,540
and increase with the vibration force

140
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,610
amplified vibration is transferred to

141
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,410
the fluid within the inner ear and the

142
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,740
inner ear chamber is shaped tightly

143
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,330
coiled snail shell called the cochlea we

144
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,340
see that here in purple

145
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:54,569
well investigate a little bit further so

146
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:56,789
we're transferring the sound pressure

147
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:59,819
waves or eardrum ultimate to the bones

148
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,250
located here now in the caca there hair

149
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,230
cells that rest on the membrane running

150
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,720
up and down the chamber and they're

151
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,280
converted by other membranes see that

152
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,700
here this is a cockpit here in the

153
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:14,759
region that's coiled like as a snail's

154
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:17,159
shell sound waves entering the cafe

155
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,110
accustomed to sandwich and vibrate bent

156
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,000
hair cells same nerve impulses to the

157
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,919
brain it's kind of like all these like

158
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,769
receptors here and they're basically

159
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:28,439
movement is how we're able to interpret

160
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:31,379
those different pressure waves located

161
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,540
in the air this is found through

162
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,519
transduction which are vibrations that

163
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,439
travel up the fluid-filled interior and

164
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,120
talk via different thicknesses of the

165
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,350
membranes vibrate responds in different

166
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,420
frequencies of sound

167
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:45,450
we kind of see that evident here here

168
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,710
seven thousand Hertz 5,000 4,000 3,000

169
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:51,719
2,000 Hertz 20,000 located right here

170
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:53,219
not heard by very many in the same

171
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,620
principle applies here where there are

172
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,250
hair cells and the cross section

173
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,139
calculate here the top right figure note

174
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,389
that there's the addition of the upper

175
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,659
canal and lower canal attack it also has

176
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,919
a middle canal there's our upper lower

177
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,140
and here's our middle canals that were

178
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,120
zooming in here the bottom image is the

179
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,849
site of the sound actual transduction

180
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,579
and it's movement of the stereocilia and

181
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:20,550
hair cells results in the action

182
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:22,709
potential that travel along the auditory

183
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,840
nerve that's ultimately it's being sent

184
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:27,859
to the brain and it's how we are able to

185
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,859
perceive sound
