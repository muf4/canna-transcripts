1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,870
in this video we're going to be

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,080
investigating non vascular plants

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,509
putting parentheses bryophytes this is a

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,330
classification of plants that might

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,490
commonly refer to as mosses there are

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,500
more scientifically called bryophytes

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,269
they're considered very early or

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,240
primitive plants we're going to talk

9
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,469
about why that is so to start with the

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:23,879
reason why we say they're primitive is

11
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:26,339
they're not too far away from clean

12
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,809
algae and our cladogram here they are

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,730
considered to be the first successful

14
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,948
land plants and have no vascular system

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,630
as a result the maximum size of the

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,420
plant is greatly limited because all

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,600
materials have to be transported by

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,429
diffusion and osmosis even under ideal

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,160
growing conditions you'll see mosses are

20
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:46,500
very short they don't get very tall

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,359
because they don't have this vascular

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,429
system and everything has to go through

23
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,619
the process of diffusion and osmosis and

24
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,479
this limits their overall height that

25
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,979
they can get

26
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,479
so remember diffusion is a net movement

27
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,979
of molecules from an area of high

28
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,409
concentration to an area of low

29
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:02,069
concentration see here with the food dye

30
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:05,488
in the bottle

31
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,989
its diffusing throughout if we came back

32
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,510
a couple days later this would all

33
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:12,569
hopefully be a consistent blue color

34
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:16,469
when everything diffused through the

35
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:17,879
water in this case in the bottle to give

36
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,069
you another example of that here's high

37
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,649
concentration we see it going to low

38
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,779
concentration over time to the point

39
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,750
that the molecules on the top and bottom

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,019
side will equal one another and it's in

41
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,060
the process of diffusion as most it's a

42
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,408
little different as most this is the

43
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,609
process by which two molecules of the

44
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,978
solvent and that pass through a

45
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:40,409
semipermeable membrane from a less

46
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:42,539
concentrated solution into a more

47
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,280
concentrated one resulting in equal

48
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,380
concentrations on both sides of the

49
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,930
membrane we see that here is our water

50
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,949
here's our solvent molecules our solid

51
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,829
molecules can't pass through this

52
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,799
semipermeable membrane but the water can

53
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:58,468
and that will result in a change in the

54
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,049
water height here water molecules travel

55
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:02,908
through this membrane trying to even out

56
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,560
on both sides trying to make even

57
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,118
concentrations on both sides

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,459
osmosis as we saw in red blood cells we

59
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,750
could see them causing the shrivel

60
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,650
isotonic is when equal waters moving in

61
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,539
and out

62
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,819
hypotonic is when more water's coming in

63
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,848
and going out in red blood cells that

64
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:22,979
they could lyse or break apart and in

65
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:24,810
hypertonic think of it like making a

66
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,238
pickle you get that kind of shriveled

67
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,340
look to it in the sea now we're talking

68
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,920
about plants kind of the translation of

69
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,829
that hypertonic situation called plasma

70
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,259
sized implants isotonic is called

71
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,609
flaccid and hypotonic is detergent

72
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,408
there's a lot of water here a lot of

73
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:43,769
water pressure this can be important to

74
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:45,509
hold plants upright talk about

75
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,150
nondescript plants or bryophytes there's

76
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:49,828
actually some other classifications

77
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,989
liverworts hornworts and mosses is that

78
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:53,909
a liver or norton loss looks like I

79
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,180
chose mosses you're probably most

80
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:58,729
familiar with that but all of these

81
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,079
pretty much lack of vascular system

82
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:03,869
mosses has a very simple conducting

83
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,909
tissue soft strands but for the most

84
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:10,349
part these are all considered non

85
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:12,509
vascular the lifecycle of a moss not to

86
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:14,669
get into too much detail key part is

87
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,888
because they are so low growing and then

88
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:18,869
transporting all their nutrients through

89
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,409
diffusion as Moses they need water

90
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,989
transport so if a Moss dries out they

91
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:27,509
are unable to reproduce need that sperm

92
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,639
being to swim to the egg this is why we

93
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,469
typically see them in shaded regions or

94
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,870
areas that tend to hold a lot of

95
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:35,579
moisture in that case fertilization

96
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,620
process is the same sperm eating egg

97
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,840
producing an embryo sporophytes

98
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,530
developed we see a female gametophyte

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,169
and male gametophyte these need to have

100
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,509
a union between the two need to merge

101
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,939
with one another with water present and

102
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,828
that will then form the fertilization

103
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:56,128
process that forms the embryo that goes

104
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:57,239
around this is Ulta also involves a

105
00:03:56,128 --> 00:04:00,478
little bit of alternation of generations

106
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,908
that can occur which is in another video

107
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,370
there the key part with mosses being

108
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:09,620
solo and nonvascular they typically are

109
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,620
found in areas with high water content
