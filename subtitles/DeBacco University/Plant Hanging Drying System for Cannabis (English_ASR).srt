1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,198
a very common method of drying cannabis

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,759
is

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,758
simply putting it out to hang to dry so

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,440
on this debaco university video i'm

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,080
going to go over some of the details of

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,480
plant

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,080
hanging for efficient drying as well as

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,440
show you some examples of actual

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
cannabis plants going through that

10
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,960
drying process

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,480
so you can make sure it applies to your

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,480
particular growing situation

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,480
[Music]

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,238
all right let's get into plant hanging

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,840
drying system regarding cannabis and

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,359
here we see a drying room

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
uh with some canvas being hung out to

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:40,320
dry we noticed that there is a lot of

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,399
space between the different areas here

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
this is allowing a good air circulation

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,160
we see the fan running in the background

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,759
we see temperature humidity controls

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,519
here very clean environment

24
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,839
this is kind of giving you an indication

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,760
of what a true drying system

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,840
operating at peak efficiency should look

27
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,839
like now the drying process

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,440
is critical so after all the work of

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,359
growing the harvesting the goal is to

30
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,558
maximize the quality of the end product

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,478
you're going to produce

32
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,599
while you cannot create high quality end

33
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,359
product and

34
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,519
in the drying process you can certainly

35
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,280
lose what started out as a high quality

36
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,079
product if you do not perform this

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,599
correctly

38
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,359
so a lot of growers spend a lot of time

39
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,640
worrying about nutrients and plant care

40
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,640
and pruning

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,799
also make sure you're also putting the

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,439
effort into a proper

43
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,000
drying process to allow that final

44
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,959
product

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,519
to show its true qualities now this hang

46
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,599
drying

47
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,280
method very commonly implemented is

48
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,839
considered by some to be the preferred

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,719
method

50
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,840
for for preserving bud conditions now

51
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,759
the quick method

52
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,439
at time of harvest it does not require

53
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,719
high labor investment of time to

54
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,239
manicure the buds

55
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,319
that's one of the reasons why it's so

56
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,000
advantageous several buds in the same

57
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,118
branch can also dry together as we saw

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,438
in the previous image

59
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,879
making it also a very efficient process

60
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,639
now different growers may choose to

61
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,438
remove different amounts or percentages

62
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,399
of fan leaves but again that amount

63
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,319
does offer the grower an option for the

64
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,118
drying environment

65
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,599
now the hang drying downfall because no

66
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,840
method

67
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,438
is absolutely perfect so this method

68
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,239
does require that there's plenty of

69
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,000
space

70
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,560
to allow not only the hanging of

71
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
branches but also sufficient airflow you

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,239
don't want to have all your branches all

73
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,039
packed in in that room you want to make

74
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,719
sure that there is

75
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,199
sufficient air flow here we see down in

76
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,039
iowa above the plants below the plants

77
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,958
all those are important areas

78
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,120
to allow that air to be able to mix

79
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,800
evenly there should be space between the

80
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,719
branches and also between the rows

81
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,319
so be sure not to over pack a dry room

82
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,039
because it's going to cause uneven

83
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,119
drying

84
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,400
inconsistent drying and issues in the

85
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,200
end

86
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
now it can be cut and hung but not

87
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,919
advised so

88
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,840
some growers will like to take the whole

89
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,280
plant cut it and immediately dry it

90
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
and while each bud does not need

91
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,800
individual attention to the degree

92
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,239
that the rack system would require

93
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,840
talked about in another video

94
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,200
there should be some time spent to

95
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,719
remove some of the leaves around the

96
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,639
buds on a branch

97
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,840
it is possible to simply cut the branch

98
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,759
from the original plant

99
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,039
or even just cut the plant down and hang

100
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,039
it for drying

101
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,479
though this is not often advised as we

102
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,120
see here can be done but not usually

103
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,479
advised

104
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,319
some care should be taken to remove at

105
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,399
least some of the fan leaves

106
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,919
as this will help ensure an even and

107
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,920
consistent drying process

108
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,439
and also reduce the initial humidity

109
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,000
that will need to be regulated in the

110
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,959
area

111
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,639
so keep in mind want to keep the

112
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,200
immediate particular region the bigger

113
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,598
range

114
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,479
so you can have uh dehumidifiers if you

115
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,560
remove some of those

116
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,759
uh fan leaves that are not needed anyway

117
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
you're reducing the stress

118
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,878
on the system so your system can be able

119
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,959
to maintain

120
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,639
those target humidity levels a little

121
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,158
bit easier

122
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,919
now there's a dry hanging myth i've

123
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,120
heard some growers say that when hanging

124
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,280
the plants upside down

125
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,319
the plant components will not that's

126
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,840
just or not

127
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,439
drain into the buds that are fixed in

128
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,400
the plant so things oh drying upside

129
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,719
down perfect

130
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,319
all the good kind of left over

131
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,519
cannabinoids and terpenes

132
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,359
they're all going to be able to kind of

133
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,080
work their way down through and with

134
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
gravity

135
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,560
end up in the bud and that is not the

136
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,158
case they're fixed in the plant

137
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,759
the reason why we hang them upside down

138
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,438
here is simply because the ease and

139
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,120
simplicity of this method

140
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,719
not because we're using gravity to force

141
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
anything down to the bottom here and

142
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,959
concentrate it in the buds

143
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,238
that simply is not the case now you want

144
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,920
to be cautious of

145
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,680
light so here we're seeing that same

146
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,479
image at the beginning with the lights

147
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,199
off how it is

148
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,798
mostly kept with the hanging drying

149
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,720
method the spacing of plants for the

150
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,560
purposes of increased air circulation

151
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,400
also means they'll be exposed evenly to

152
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,478
light want to keep that light minimal

153
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,758
both the intensity as well as the

154
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,439
duration so again that duration of light

155
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
should be minimum in the sense that you

156
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,519
don't have to always keep them in the

157
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:34,719
dark you have to run in there and get

158
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,719
something go through something

159
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,320
go right ahead uh but keep the lights on

160
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,440
for the least amount of duration

161
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,360
and make sure you're not turning all the

162
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,319
lights on just a minimum amount of light

163
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,479
that you need to get in

164
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,040
and get out keep in mind does not mean

165
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,800
we kept 100 dark the entire time

166
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,560
but just be aware that light exposure

167
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,120
they are getting it and keep it to a

168
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,478
minimum

169
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,918
some growers will say i want to go in

170
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:54,879
there today because they're drying if

171
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,478
you don't have to

172
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,079
then don't but don't think that you're

173
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,519
forbidden from that area during the

174
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,839
drying process keep it short

175
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,758
keep it quick and it should be fine now

176
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,478
let's go into it let's take a look at

177
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,120
a real world example of looking at some

178
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:08,719
canvas

179
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,720
that is going through the drying process

180
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,240
with this hang and dry method

181
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,000
and hopefully this will allow you to see

182
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,319
a couple slightly different systems

183
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,959
the consistencies amongst them to see if

184
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,240
it applies to your situation

185
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,478
okay so here we're noticing a plant

186
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,639
that's recently been harvested

187
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,079
flipped upside down and is now in the

188
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,680
drying process

189
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,279
keep in mind while it is efficient to

190
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,720
flip them upside down and to dry them

191
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,159
and they hang them this way

192
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,199
it does not increase any of the

193
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,960
cannabinoids so it's common

194
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,759
misconception oh they flip it outside so

195
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,560
all the

196
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,000
good chemicals and juices and terpenes

197
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,439
all kind of get to the buds

198
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,038
that's not the case they're locked in

199
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,719
the plant where they're going to be this

200
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,680
is just very efficient

201
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,039
kind of easy able to hang them easily

202
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,759
able to stock a lot in

203
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,360
a small area so this is a great way to

204
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,439
go through and dry your plants

205
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,439
but don't think by drying them this way

206
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,719
it's going to increase any cannabinoids

207
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,719
that might be in the stems

208
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,720
and work their way down that's simply

209
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,840
not the case

210
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,360
okay so this shows some nice drying here

211
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,679
we're noticing

212
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
uh this is all came from the field and

213
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,800
we noticed kind of hanging on this deer

214
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,038
netting creating a nice little

215
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,199
area here down the hallway which really

216
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:21,839
helps dry very efficiently

217
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,600
also creates a very nice visual effect

218
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,839
the deer netting where we're drying all

219
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,520
the cannabis buds and the actual wall

220
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,119
here and this is important to maintain

221
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,279
this because we do want to have

222
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,720
a certain gap here to allow air

223
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,198
circulation to come through

224
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,360
the hallway is on this side but we did

225
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,879
not put these up here against the wall

226
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960
which is a good thing because you do

227
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,560
want to have that even air circulation

228
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,638
to allow efficient drying

229
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,160
and also even drying and as i come on

230
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,519
this side you can see the hallway

231
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
let's kind of get that hallway like the

232
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,879
wizard of oz kind of look to it where we

233
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,080
look at the emerald city

234
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,240
uh and here we have a nice green area

235
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,879
with all the cannabis buds drying

236
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,000
and drying in a way that looks very nice

237
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,279
and also is very efficient

238
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,800
so here we're seeing some cannabis

239
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,879
that's recently been harvested and is

240
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,038
now looking at being dried

241
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,560
ready for the next stage of processing

242
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,639
and by going through and hang it like

243
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,079
this we see a very efficient way to

244
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:19,120
dry it and keep everything consistent

245
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,598
notice how there's space under underside

246
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,120
everything there's a walkway we've got

247
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:24,478
humidity monitoring

248
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,240
we're trying to maintain consistent

249
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,038
conditions there's also a lot of air

250
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,840
moving

251
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,959
in this area all very important as well

252
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,279
as the muted

253
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,478
lighting to help again us monitor the

254
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,239
plants but also

255
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,439
ensure that we're not getting direct

256
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:45,519
sunlight and then they might be doing

257
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:45,519
any damage to them
