1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,710
okay here we're looking at the lower

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:07,108
limbs here you see here with the Wicked

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,719
Witch of the West lower limbs bone

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:11,339
structure may not be matching what we're

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,109
going to be discussing here but here's

6
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,138
what we are going to be looking at

7
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:19,019
basically what we need to call the leg

8
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:20,939
bones so for the lower limbs this

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,250
classic thanks kind of a listing of some

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,339
of the major bones here the consists of

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,899
the thigh the leg and the foot so the

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,469
bones of lower limb are the femur the

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:33,780
patella the tibia and fibula the tarsals

14
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:35,909
metatarsals and phalanges

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,980
now those might be terms you might be

16
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,898
familiar with or may not be the femur is

17
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,689
basically your thigh bone patellas your

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,969
kneecap tibia and fibula are the bones

19
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,530
of the lower leg here tarsals are the

20
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,899
bones of the ankle and metatarsals

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,090
phalanges are bones of the actual foot

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,850
so let's start with that femur that

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,379
largest bone there it's in the upper leg

24
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,379
and it's the largest bone in the human

25
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:01,108
body and also one of the strongest has a

26
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,179
lot of pressure to kind of deal with the

27
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,460
femoral head articulates with the pelvis

28
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,500
to form the hip joint this shaft ascends

29
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,089
in a slightly medial direction and it's

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,129
designed to bring the knees closer to

31
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,109
the body center of gravity this helps

32
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:14,069
increase your stability so a lot of

33
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,618
these bones while they may look

34
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:19,438
perfectly straight are not that way on

35
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:22,469
purpose to help with the basic geometry

36
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,750
for maintaining stability or increase in

37
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:26,400
strength distally the femur exhibits two

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,709
rounded regions so that's the FAR's

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,540
point down here and they articulate with

40
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:33,000
the tibia in the most anterior

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,090
projection of the patella that's getting

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,680
into that knee region so that patella

43
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,810
region because you just left the femur

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,930
here at the bottom that patella but tell

45
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,149
us basically the knee or the kneecap and

46
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,549
it's the bone between the fibula and the

47
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,649
femur two main functions is to protect

48
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,689
the knee from physical trauma and it

49
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,000
acts as also kind of a leverage at the

50
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:56,039
quadriceps in tendon can exert on the

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,560
femur thereby increasing the muscle

52
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,479
efficiency so again we see another bone

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,250
being placed and we protect portions of

54
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,269
the body that delicate joint but also

55
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,610
increasing muscle efficiency the tibia

56
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:11,639
and fibula of the leg hairs were kind in

57
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,900
that lower leg region the tibia is this

58
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,908
small is

59
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,370
the smaller fibula bones comprised the

60
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:21,329
lower leg and articulate with the knee

61
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,489
so the tibia is the thicker bone we can

62
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,769
kind of think of it in that way a lot of

63
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:28,680
people confuse the tibia and fibula the

64
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,989
fibula is the smaller one so that tibia

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,579
if you think T and thicker that can help

66
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,829
you remember that in a quick and visual

67
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:36,780
comparison it spans the lower leg

68
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,280
articulates with the proximal e with the

69
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,110
femur and patella the knee joint and

70
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,658
distally with the tarsals bones at the

71
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,099
ankle joint that's down here it's a

72
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:46,679
major weight-bearing bone of the leg

73
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,328
because is the thicker one the fibula

74
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,549
you can think about being fragile it's

75
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:52,530
the thinner one it also spans the lower

76
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,209
leg and although approximately does not

77
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,250
articulate with the femur or the patella

78
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,890
that's been located right here serves

79
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,289
more as an attachment point for muscles

80
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,750
rather than a weight-bearing bone and

81
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:06,269
that's why it tends to be more fragile

82
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:08,939
the thicker tibia is doing most of the

83
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,620
weight bearing we have the tarsals and

84
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,439
metatarsals and the phalanges

85
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,819
so in humans the ankle and foot bones

86
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,889
include the tarsals that's your actual

87
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:18,418
ankle metatarsals are kind of your

88
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:21,599
middle bones and the phalanges are the

89
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:23,700
actual toes kind of like very similar to

90
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,399
analogous kind of being in your hand we

91
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:29,098
see those seem terms the phalanges

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,180
fingers and toes being given here so

93
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:32,759
it's important to make that distinction

94
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,560
of where you are talking about when

95
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,560
you're using that particular term
