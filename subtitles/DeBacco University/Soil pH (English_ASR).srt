1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,719
okay here we're gonna be looking at soil

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:06,000
pH so there's no difference between the

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,679
PHS soil there's a pH of water it's all

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,570
following the same zero to fourteen

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,120
scale and we're talking specifically

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,780
about soil pH we're looking at assessing

7
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,579
the pH of the actual media or substrate

8
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,850
that the plants are going to be growing

9
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,500
in so while it is the soil we're going

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,778
to looking at if you're having a problem

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,740
with pH it's a good idea to test your

12
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:27,359
irrigation water

13
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,518
this testing the pH of your irrigation

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,399
waters a good idea is this can impact

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,049
plant growth in soil quality so here for

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,239
example this is your irrigation water

17
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:40,289
and it has a pH of four point nine six

18
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,390
this could vastly be impacting the pH of

19
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,219
your soil and again depending on what

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,590
media might be growing in what and why

21
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,189
it's so acidic in part test your water

22
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,480
to start the page scale is the same zero

23
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,420
to fourteen scale it's a logarithmic

24
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:57,538
because as you can see here it's a

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,480
tenfold increase per each pH unit that

26
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,980
it goes up and this is important so if

27
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,530
we said I'm only a couple points off

28
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,048
well that's like tenfold increase so

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,329
that I can get exponentially off there

30
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,700
and this reason why we want to maintain

31
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:14,310
that pH is affects the availability of

32
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,799
nutrients for our plants so how do we

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,759
test it well it's easy to do pH meters

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,830
only can test liquid not dry soil so we

35
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,920
have to go through and develop a liquid

36
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,840
medium or slurry from your soil be sure

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,879
the tester you're using is calibrated

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,560
and the probe doesn't dry out there's a

39
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,140
term called when it dries it dies this

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,868
is why you'll see in labs pH probes are

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,430
kept and usually distilled water at all

42
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:41,040
times even when not in use

43
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,509
now how do you go about testing soil

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,460
well you wanna start at the clean probes

45
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,709
don't want to have any interaction or

46
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,359
contaminants when I add distilled water

47
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,368
to the soil to create a slurry and then

48
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,540
test the pH especially before you can't

49
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:52,769
just kind of take the probe and put it

50
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,899
in the pot put it in the soil and get an

51
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:57,420
accurate reading for pH need to kind of

52
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,799
create this slurry solution here to

53
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,879
again get that accurate reading and

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,890
that's why you want to use distilled

55
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,519
water so the water you're adding isn't

56
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,038
influencing the total pH so I'm so I'm

57
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,538
pH testing best done as part of a

58
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,859
complete soil test that's carried out

59
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,929
with consistent protocols in a

60
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,890
professional lab I'd much rather send my

61
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,870
solar media

62
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,119
to LabVIEW professionally done they do

63
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,099
make these kits we kind of add solutions

64
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,379
and they kind of look at the color these

65
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,389
can give you very results it's best to

66
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,629
get it done professional lab with a set

67
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:28,619
of protocols that target pH is what you

68
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:30,419
should be shooting for and that's

69
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,030
usually around six and a half to seven

70
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:35,129
or so six eight is usually kind of the

71
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,110
ideal or the sweet spot know if you're

72
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,469
growing hydroponically it could be

73
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,420
better

74
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,030
you might target might be a little bit

75
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,979
more acidic that five point eight to six

76
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,729
point eight or six point three being the

77
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:50,039
ideal pH again acidic is pH is below

78
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:52,018
seven those hydroponic setup stead also

79
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,759
to have reduce buffering capacity if

80
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,069
it's just pure water this would cause

81
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,259
rapid swings in the pH and this can

82
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,549
result in very poor plant performance so

83
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:00,689
if you are growing hydroponically you

84
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,480
want to make sure you just buffers in

85
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,680
place to help resist change in pH so I

86
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,509
do want to maintain it slightly more

87
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,459
acidic but you kind of want to prevent

88
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:10,469
that pH and jumping around a lot there's

89
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,229
really going to affect and negatively

90
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:15,209
impact your plant's growth

91
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:17,518
now if correcting or rising the soil pH

92
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,849
that's very common for New England soils

93
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,680
which is typically looking at five and a

94
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,689
half to six so often this needs to be

95
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,700
raised can even be less than this

96
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:29,519
limestone is the most common method for

97
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,988
raising soil pH this is a general term

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,360
there's many different types of lime

99
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,980
build my say on liming the soil well

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,079
looking look more specifically the

101
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,399
options you have within the broad

102
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,590
category of limestone

103
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,140
so there's dolomitic lime this is the

104
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,060
cheapest and easiest to find I see even

105
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,339
here dolomitic limestone the concert is

106
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,140
very high in magnesium so if you have a

107
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,849
soil test that comes high in magnesium

108
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,488
well odds are you might be looking at

109
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:55,609
another lime alternative but this is the

110
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,870
cheapest and typically easiest to find

111
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,670
then there's something called calcitic

112
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,129
lime and this is very effective at

113
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,488
raising the soils pH it's mainly just

114
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:07,199
calcium it's not very high in magnesium

115
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,030
so again for high magnesium soils

116
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,039
calcitic lime might be the way to go

117
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,459
cons are typically harder to find and

118
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,709
can be more costly when you do find it

119
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,600
the other third main category of lime is

120
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,030
what's called hydrated lime this is a

121
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,590
quick way to change pH often though it's

122
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,689
not a long term pH to change its

123
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:26,399
solution and for conditions that require

124
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,689
high doses there can be taxes and B

125
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,519
issues lastly

126
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,560
mucous membrane irritant and typically

127
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,810
why with this line they'll see keep out

128
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,939
of reach of children it's a very usually

129
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,949
a finding dusty product and if you do

130
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:39,750
breathe any of that in it will feel kind

131
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,629
of that burning sensation of your mucous

132
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,970
membranes

133
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:47,069
there's also that's love lowering soil

134
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,510
pH this is a condition where your pH

135
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,459
would be seven or even a little bit

136
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,069
above that common Rocky Mountains in

137
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,479
West where the pH is a little higher

138
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:56,639
then the desired amount for plant growth

139
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,280
typically ultimately adding sulfur iron

140
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,709
sulfate or aluminum sulfate these are

141
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,779
all ways to kind of help lower the pH of

142
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,120
your soil to help get it again to that

143
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,459
sweet spot that target range of being

144
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,290
slightly acidic for maximum nutrient

145
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,289
elderly and for the best plant growth
