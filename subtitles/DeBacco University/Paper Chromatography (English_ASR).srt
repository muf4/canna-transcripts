1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,040
okay here i'm going to describe some of

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,479
the basics of paper

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,120
chromatography which you might be

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,320
familiar with producing pretty colors

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,280
on paper based on using ink dyes

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,679
as just a model example to start off

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,678
with

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,199
how does chromatography in general work

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,278
what are the basic components

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,800
of how this works well it works through

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,320
what's called capillary action and

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,240
that's the movement of a liquid within

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,079
the spaces of porous material

14
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,278
due to the forces of adhesion cohesion

15
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,439
and surface tension

16
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,759
here we see blue liquid and we see the

17
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,920
different diameters of these glass tubes

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
as that diameter gets smaller we're

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,359
noticing that that

20
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,359
liquid is able to travel higher and

21
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,280
that's through capillary action

22
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,200
the liquid is able to move up in the

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,280
filter paper because of the attraction

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,520
to itself is stronger than the force of

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
gravity as those walls get closer those

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,920
forces of attraction is greater

27
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,198
they can travel further up this glass

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,520
tube as an example

29
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,320
and paper the pores are very small as

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,480
well and that

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
allows it to again move and fight the

32
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,959
force of gravity

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,198
so the solubility which is the degree in

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,840
which a material or solute dissolves in

35
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,118
a solvent solutes dissolve into solvents

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,200
that have similar properties

37
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,438
it's called like dissolves like what

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,159
that means is that if a substance is

39
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,639
polar

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,640
or has a charge to it for example water

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,478
is polar and has a charge to it

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,680
so a substance like that will be able to

43
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,000
dissolve very well in water if something

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,000
isn't

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
nonpolar you might want to use like an

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,759
alcohol base because that also

47
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,359
doesn't have a charge to it so it says

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
light dissolves like that's kind of

49
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,959
getting into the components

50
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,840
of the properties of the solute in the

51
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,559
cell vent

52
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,759
looking at polarity or charge being one

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,280
key example

54
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,280
this allows different solutes to be

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,239
separated by different combinations of

56
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,359
solvents so what to look for is while

57
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,118
you may see one color

58
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,478
initially this is looking particularly

59
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,200
at inks there may be

60
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,920
separated into two or more individual

61
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,759
colors

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,519
so this will happen over time with

63
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,718
certain color spots traveling

64
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,759
to the same distance within your paper

65
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,000
chromatography

66
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,840
in some examples the concentration of

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
the alcohol and the solvents is changing

68
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,959
resulting in different traveling

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,159
distances of the dyes and you're going

70
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,878
to see an example

71
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,598
of how that plays into on the diff

72
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,359
distance that certain colors will travel

73
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,639
so first off go over the basic kind of

74
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,840
setup here of

75
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,159
paper chromatography you have the

76
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,400
starting line this is where the inks

77
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,598
are initially placed you can see that

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,080
dots here they're posts

79
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,119
they're it go through the center of that

80
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
initial ink

81
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,000
you'll notice that the liquid level is

82
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,439
below those inks you don't want that

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,360
liquid level initially to come in

84
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,680
contact with the dikes it will dilute it

85
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
into this mobile phase what's going to

86
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
happen is

87
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,159
this mobile phase is going to wick its

88
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,680
way through

89
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,519
this chromatography paper it's going to

90
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,159
move its way up against the force of

91
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,360
gravity

92
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,519
as it does so it's going to pick up

93
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
these dies and separate them out based

94
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,480
on their individual colors

95
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,239
we then have the finish line which is

96
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,280
the highest point that the solvent

97
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,719
travels

98
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,000
and we have that stationary phase in

99
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,719
this case which is the chromatography

100
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,878
paper

101
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,080
and in this example it's all encased in

102
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,120
a beaker to keep everything

103
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,879
contained so chromatically over time

104
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,158
this doesn't happen immediately

105
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,239
initially can you have a really quick

106
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,120
start we can see how it very quickly

107
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,759
will progress

108
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
and in this example for this paper for

109
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,439
this

110
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,879
isopropyl for this material takes about

111
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,479
30 minutes to run to the top

112
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,039
you can see at 25 you have a pretty good

113
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,318
indication 30 would be the run time

114
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,479
sometimes you don't want to run it too

115
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,158
long or too little because you want an

116
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,919
adequate separation without it

117
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,199
overrunning or you don't want everything

118
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,559
to be compressed

119
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,919
either so really observing

120
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
our chromatography here as i mentioned

121
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,318
the concentration can play a role

122
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,238
and in this case this just shows you an

123
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,000
example of how it does play a role

124
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,519
here's our different percentages i'm

125
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,598
looking at alcohol-based

126
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,439
solvent and we can see zero percent

127
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:53,679
alcohol the dots barely move at all

128
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,479
and as we increase the percentage we're

129
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,920
noticing an

130
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,438
increased distance of travel so this is

131
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,839
important to take into consideration the

132
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,878
properties of the paper or the coating

133
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,080
on the paper

134
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,840
uh the solute the solvent

135
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,000
and what you're looking at separating in

136
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,438
this case 100 percent looks like it does

137
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,719
produce quite a good separation though

138
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,479
we do kind of lose some of that yellow

139
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,438
color at least in this example looks

140
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,079
like to me

141
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,358
70 offers a pretty good separation and

142
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,519
you're still getting some of that yellow

143
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,198
color in this die here

144
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,560
so if you look at certain dies and again

145
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,478
over those kind of

146
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,160
separation factors here try to zoom in a

147
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,399
little bit highlight it for you those

148
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,240
dyes do separate into purples and blacks

149
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,000
not soluble in low concentrations

150
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,918
partially cellular concentrations

151
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,519
greater than 20 percent

152
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,599
if you use this same kind of model here

153
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,120
and look at blue dyes we can see also

154
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,560
not very soluble

155
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,079
but completely soluble at higher

156
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,959
concentrations so this is again an

157
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,639
example where

158
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,719
you'd be wanting to run this experiment

159
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,360
at a higher concentration

160
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,160
and then we have green dyes separated

161
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,759
into blues

162
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,680
and yellows which might be a little hard

163
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,000
to see but try to kind of highlight some

164
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,879
of them

165
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,879
here its concentration devices of

166
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,560
isopropanol is greater than 20 percent

167
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,800
yellow silo concentrations of

168
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,918
isopropanol less than one percent so you

169
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
get kind of this kind of

170
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,599
mixture of depending on exactly what you

171
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,400
want to separate exactly what you're

172
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
looking for

173
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,439
there will be an ideal concentration to

174
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,560
look at and to be able to

175
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,120
use for your separation process lastly

176
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,360
here we have

177
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,199
red dyes so just looking at the red dye

178
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,038
i separate into reds and yellows the

179
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,079
yellow side will low concentrations of

180
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,759
the isopropanol

181
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,758
and less side of a higher concentration

182
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,280
right not one perfect amount of

183
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,038
isopropanol to use

184
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,638
it depends on what color you're looking

185
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,000
at investigating and how you want to

186
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,759
separate that out

187
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,680
so the red dye is slightly soluble in

188
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,919
low concentrations and more silent

189
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,120
concentrations greater than 20 percent

190
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,120
so this is something you want to

191
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,079
investigate further based on these

192
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,959
results

193
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:52,319
that is the concentration of isopropanol

194
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,319
that you should be using
