1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
okay here all at the simple and

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,819
hopefully not over complicated of a

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,980
cloning method called the cutting stick

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,990
just as the name implies you take a

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,750
cutting and you stick it into a media or

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,539
some sort of area where you're going to

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,769
encourage root development so cutting

8
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:19,019
take the simple and easy it's the

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,089
easiest of methods you're just as the

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,469
name implies you're growing taking the

11
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,879
growing tip of the plant you're cutting

12
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:26,309
it and then sticking it into growing

13
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,698
media scissors typically aren't

14
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:31,348
encouraged usually we use a sharp knife

15
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,579
we stick them into media in this case we

16
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,770
have everything prepared we have our

17
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,210
cuttings and water ready to go and this

18
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,219
is a kind of important part of the

19
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,120
process and while it is easy when I'm

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,980
sure everything is set up ahead of time

21
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,149
what you're sticking the clone into the

22
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,369
media that can be a wide variety

23
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,558
material can be Rockwell we saw in the

24
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:52,198
previous image could be say end could be

25
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,878
soilless mix these foam key part is you

26
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,128
need a media that's going to support and

27
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,539
keep that plant upright you serve

28
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:59,698
rooting hormone surges clone exits

29
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,149
advise to help encourage rooting and

30
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:05,188
reduce the time to route some optional

31
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,109
materials with this you can use misting

32
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,478
or a humidity dome can help increase the

33
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,909
humidity and reduce water stress he met

34
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,250
is often used as well to help increase

35
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,750
the Runestone temperature and all of

36
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,640
these things help reduce plant stress

37
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,959
and increase the routing percentage some

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,219
of the drawbacks this method is

39
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,500
depending on the propagation environment

40
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,719
such as light temperature video most

41
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,430
uniformity and so on this method may

42
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,739
suffer from an above-average percent of

43
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,299
loss of clothes so sometimes you kind of

44
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,379
get trade that may look like this where

45
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,360
you get a couple that just aren't going

46
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,670
to make it and if some that do make it

47
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,349
the more consistent you can keep the

48
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,359
conditions the better odds that you'll

49
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,699
have sometimes you're going to take one

50
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,019
put it right in a glass of water and

51
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,609
sometimes little group right there so

52
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:49,769
some instance give some people some

53
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,840
extra confidence and things that it can

54
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:55,349
work but there's one of the drawbacks is

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,118
that typically this can result in not a

56
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,250
hundred percent as some other methods

57
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,438
but considering it's simple it's easy

58
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,938
sometimes taking the small percent loss

59
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:07,368
for not a lot of investment and other

60
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,368
things is advantageous for some growers
