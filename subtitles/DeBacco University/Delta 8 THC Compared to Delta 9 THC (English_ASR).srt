1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,480
many of you may have heard of delta 8

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,839
thc and delta 9 thc and wondered what

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,759
the differences were

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,920
well here on this tobacco university

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,320
video we're going to go over and compare

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,759
just what delta 8 thc is compared to

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,839
what delta 9 thc

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,320
is hopefully you find this information

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,320
useful

10
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,799
[Music]

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,960
all right let's get into delta 8 thc

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,239
compared to delta 9 thc well first off

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,880
delta 8 thc can be classified currently

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,679
as hemp where delta 9 thc is what can

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,719
classify

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,799
a cannabis plant as marijuana so first

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,359
off let's explain the delta 9 thc

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,479
something

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,479
you might have heard a little bit more

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,878
might be more familiar with is an

21
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,119
activator of the cb1 receptor the delta

22
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,039
9 it's commonly known as thc and is the

23
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,839
main intoxicating component

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,280
to cannabis thc intoxication has been

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,719
shown to increase blood flow in the

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,558
peripheral frontal

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
cortex region of the brain which is

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,799
responsible for decision making

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,799
attention

30
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,280
motor skills and other executive

31
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,280
functions when thc binds to cb1

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,079
receptors in the brain's reward system

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,079
it can trigger the feelings of euphoria

34
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,719
much of tac's ability to relieve pain

35
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,679
is due to its interaction with the cb1

36
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,679
receptors

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,118
in the midbrain now we're going to talk

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,360
about delta 8

39
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,879
thc but here's just a little comparison

40
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,599
of the structures

41
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,079
we can see at first glance pretty

42
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,158
similar

43
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,679
look almost identical but the key part

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
here is the double bond here

45
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,040
or the double bond here that's the

46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,680
difference between your

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
delta nine and your delta eight has to

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,439
do where that double bond

49
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,959
is located however there's also great

50
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,239
benefits and that's a switch of a double

51
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,199
bond there's also some

52
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,239
differences in the how these molecules

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,200
interact

54
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,719
so let's look at the delta eight thc

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,960
delta a is an isomer

56
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,478
of delta nine t h and as i mentioned

57
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,078
here it says changing of where that

58
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,078
double bond is located

59
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,478
only differs from the placement of that

60
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,839
atomic double bond it's only

61
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,759
structural difference at least on a

62
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,118
molecule basis generally this chemical

63
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,718
is produced in a lab

64
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,360
and not extracted directly from the

65
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,479
plant it is actually synthesized from

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,000
a cbd isolate this creates a legal

67
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,759
loophole though because the product is

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,360
being sold as hemp derived

69
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,878
even though it's actually chemically

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
produced thc

71
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,000
isomer so it's important kind of

72
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
distinction there

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120
and this is why there's some of the

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,639
confusion why there's

75
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,680
some companies advertising a lot of

76
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,199
delta eight thc compared to delta nine

77
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,120
so we're looking at the kind of

78
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,359
extraction uh difference here

79
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
so delta eight tht is a major

80
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,160
cannabinoid

81
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,840
that can be found in abundance and is

82
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,878
easily extracted from

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,878
cannabis in comparison when we look at

84
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,759
extracting delta eight thc it is more

85
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,079
challenging

86
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,919
simply because it's a minor cannabinoid

87
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,360
so we're looking at the challenge parts

88
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,439
of delta eight it's simply

89
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,400
less concentrated so therefore it's a

90
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,120
minor cannabinoid

91
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,719
it's a little bit harder to extract uh

92
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,239
interesting article published and what

93
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,840
is the difference between delta eight

94
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,680
tht and delta nine thc

95
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,439
here uh that will be going through some

96
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
of that information as well as what

97
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,800
you've heard

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,598
already so when we're synthesizing delta

99
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
eight from

100
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,679
uh cbd delta eight can be synthesized

101
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,800
entirely from cbd

102
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,640
with the use of solvents deriving delta

103
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,719
eight from hemp ensures that the final

104
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,439
product is under the 0.3

105
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,120
thc level to be federally legal that's

106
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,639
kind of a key point there is that

107
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,120
they're staying under the federally

108
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,279
regulated 0.3 percent thc levels because

109
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,439
that's referring to delta 9.

110
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,039
so that's classifying it as hemp because

111
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,519
marijuana be anything really above

112
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,239
0.3 percent thc from a federal

113
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
standpoint

114
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,840
that's why you see these large signs

115
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,719
delta 8 thc because a lot of people are

116
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
familiar with the

117
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,799
the letters thc but this delta 8 is

118
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,079
classifying it currently

119
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,959
to be uh hemp which is has much more

120
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,560
legal options to be sold now if you want

121
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,319
to know the steps to synthesize delta

122
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,039
eight thc from a cbd isolate

123
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,639
they are basically listed right here uh

124
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,199
from a patent from

125
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,798
the website link here and it kind of

126
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,079
goes through a little bit of the process

127
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,879
and this is not a completely easy

128
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,239
process

129
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,919
you have to dissolve the nonpolar

130
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,560
solvent of choice common solvents

131
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,679
include

132
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,120
heptane add a lewis acid

133
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
and add a bunch of other things you want

134
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,879
to maintain certain temperatures you

135
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,040
want to stir for a long period of time

136
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,719
once the chemical reaction is complete

137
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,199
under phase separation you want to watch

138
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,120
and

139
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,120
neutralize a solution you want to test

140
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,120
for purity and contaminants using

141
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,720
high pressure liquid chromatography and

142
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,319
then the conversion still

143
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,160
despite all these very specific

144
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,120
scientific steps is still

145
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,600
never quite 100 so again keep that in

146
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
mind

147
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,919
this is not something necessarily easy

148
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,439
to derive

149
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,359
as a result there are different effects

150
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,478
from delta 8 thc

151
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,400
versus delta 9 thc delta 9 is

152
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,120
considerably more potent effects than

153
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,159
delta 8. paranoia delusions mental fog

154
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,000
impaired motor skills

155
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,600
increased feelings of anxiety typically

156
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,879
associated with delta

157
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,720
9. in comparison delta a is reported to

158
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,639
provide a more muted experience

159
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,320
with most users feeling a great sense of

160
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,918
common clarity however many have

161
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,439
reported a definite high

162
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,359
to the experience but not enough to

163
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,000
impair the ability to form coherent

164
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
thoughts

165
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,319
or focus on activities this also

166
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,918
provides a little comparison there

167
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,680
of delta 9 versus delta 8

168
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,198
listed effects again a little bit more

169
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,360
from anecdotal information

170
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,520
but kind of gives you that little bit of

171
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,400
a quick comparison between the two

172
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,000
and then also some similarities now the

173
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,198
onset time is different

174
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,800
so delta 9 has an onset that's more

175
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,478
rapid and instantaneous

176
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,720
delta eight works slowly and gradually

177
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,240
as it eases users to a more mellow state

178
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,759
so again keep that in mind that

179
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,360
delta eight can have a little bit more

180
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,520
of that delayed kind of

181
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,360
effect there hopefully not for your

182
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,359
airline

183
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
similar end products are being produced

184
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
from both because both can be smoked as

185
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,918
a flower inhaled

186
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,159
through vaping consumed as an edible

187
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,000
form also a wide variety of topicals

188
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
capsules tinctures edibles and other

189
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,959
products as well

190
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,720
but you'll see the delta eight usually

191
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,599
predominantly listed on

192
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,280
the label or packaging now we get into

193
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,879
legality of things and this you know

194
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,239
always subject to change but currently

195
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,719
delta ht in any amount over 0.3 percent

196
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,120
is not legal at the federal level state

197
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,880
level depends entirely on the local laws

198
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
delta eight is still technically legal

199
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,918
in federal at the federal level

200
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,680
simply because uh the kind of way that

201
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,079
the 2018 farm bill

202
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,879
is is written which legalizes hemp

203
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,560
production

204
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,439
and there is nothing within the of the

205
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,439
bill that prevents deriving delta eight

206
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,879
from hemp and creating products with

207
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,038
that particular compound

208
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,120
at least as it's stated in currently in

209
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,839
the books right now

210
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,519
so this creates that hazy area as i say

211
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,000
the psychoactive nature of delta a has

212
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,079
prompted

213
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,598
a fair number of bans at the state level

214
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,399
though so keep that in mind

215
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,000
they're currently as this particular

216
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,519
video and in the article cited

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,439
there are 15 states that restrict the

218
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,038
sale and use of delta 8 products

219
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,959
with another six states where legal

220
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,800
action is currently pending

221
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,318
so while delta a is more widespread at

222
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
the moment than delta nine

223
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,759
how long will last is yet to be

224
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,560
determined simply because it's caught in

225
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,840
that loophole

226
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,519
of the current 2018 farm bill

227
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,198
now the availability of this so when we

228
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,799
look at the availability delta a since

229
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,759
it's fed illegal can be shipped across

230
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,919
state lines

231
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,000
unlike delta 9. there's a lot more

232
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,519
online retailers for delta 8 products as

233
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,959
a result because they can ship it

234
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,038
and move it across state lines without a

235
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,198
problem however just remember that delta

236
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,879
a products are not regulated by the fda

237
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,639
so it's up to you to seek out lab

238
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,680
results tested from a third party to

239
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,560
make sure what you're consuming and

240
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
purchasing

241
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,000
is actually what you think you're

242
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
purchasing and it's also safe to be

243
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,079
using and consuming

244
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,240
so last little comparison kind of that

245
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,000
delta uh 9 versus delta 8.

246
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,439
delta 9 might be considered the classic

247
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,360
choice by some with the

248
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,560
within the cannabis community however

249
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,400
delta 8 is quickly

250
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,280
gaining popularity due to its miler

251
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,959
effects and legal availability

252
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,519
now since there's it's an isomer of

253
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,519
delta 9 is also likely to come under

254
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,198
some form of regulation in the future

255
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,279
even though that may not currently be

256
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,560
the case again that simple flip of that

257
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,439
double bond there doesn't look like it

258
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
changes much

259
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,120
you can see here with the changing of

260
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
effects but really how the current laws

261
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,319
are written

262
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,758
kind of in that hazy loophole area but

263
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,000
hopefully this provides you a little bit

264
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,520
more of an educational background

265
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,759
so you can understand better the

266
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:27,839
difference between delta 9 thc

267
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,840
and delta 8 thc levels
