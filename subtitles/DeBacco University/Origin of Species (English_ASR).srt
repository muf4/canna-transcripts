1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,139
so here we're gonna dive a little bit

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,778
more into Charles Darwin's book the

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:09,178
Origin of Species this is one of his

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:11,039
most famous works at least in the modern

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,440
day even though when it was first

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,250
published compared to the book he didn't

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,869
earthworms

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,670
the earthworm book not only was he more

9
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:20,129
proud of but it sold better than his

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,990
Origin of Species however now were able

11
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:23,339
to realize and look at this and our

12
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:27,329
diving warrant it with a little bit more

13
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:28,768
detail so it's an interesting point of

14
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,989
note at this Origin of Species is that

15
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,479
he drafted the Komen a transcript back

16
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,460
in 1842

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,979
however he shelled it then didn't really

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,600
refer to it for 16 years probably

19
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,849
because it was very controversial in

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,390
nature however you talk with Alfred

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,058
Russel Wallace he lived with 1823 to

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,929
1913 independently he had developed a

23
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:51,169
similar theory

24
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:53,100
so the correspondence between the two

25
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,149
spurred the idea of the Orang to

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,820
actually bring this theory to

27
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,698
publication and that occurred in 1859

28
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,558
the Origin of Species was disturbing to

29
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,048
many because it suggested humans and

30
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,700
apes have a common ancestor so that

31
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,460
common ancestor does that mean humans

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,760
directly derived from apes means humans

33
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:14,609
and apes have this common ancestor going

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
back in time to represent to determine

35
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:18,900
directly in a later book called The

36
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,789
Descent of Man and his idea spurred a

37
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,770
lot of political cartoons with Darwin

38
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,590
typically being portrayed as he looked

39
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:29,609
as later years with the white beard you

40
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,710
see a huge monkey here so how did

41
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,750
natural sections produce this diversity

42
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,399
how did so many of these different birds

43
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,409
derived if there's only one common

44
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,180
ancestor well don't believe that the

45
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,969
Galapagos finches all evolved from this

46
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,220
single common ancestor and he proposed

47
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,390
that common ancestor lived in the South

48
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,640
American mainland

49
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,310
so here's south america here's a kalapa

50
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,239
gross islands these new arrivals occupy

51
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,460
different niches and were subject to

52
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,218
different environmental pressures so

53
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,289
these islands are very diverse they're

54
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:04,169
in a close proximity to one another but

55
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,210
each is got its own unique habitat as a

56
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,009
result the different food items the

57
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,169
different environmental pressures could

58
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,059
lead to development these many different

59
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,629
types of finches and particularly

60
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,129
looking at their bird beaks

61
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:19,348
so this resulted in the cluster of

62
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:22,379
species this phenomena Stern adaptive

63
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:25,649
radiation so we have like one initial

64
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,098
finish and we have this radiuses a

65
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,769
radiation that occurs of different

66
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:33,509
variants of bird leaves the 14th inch

67
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,930
species that Darwin studied now occupy

68
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:39,780
four types of ditches one was insect

69
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,750
feeders seed feeders cactus parts and

70
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,900
seeds and the other cell fed on buds and

71
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,269
fruits so we see here it's kind of a

72
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,950
nice visual representation here the

73
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,289
ground finches are for crushing bills

74
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:53,789
they are the seed eaters can also be

75
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:56,939
classified as the cactus eaters

76
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,919
tough materials to eat well probing

77
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,889
Birds this could be ones for insect

78
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,379
feeders is a portion also those who have

79
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:07,018
grasping bills could live in trees for

80
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,030
rafts in on food items so this helps

81
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,840
explain the large diversity that has

82
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,009
occurred this is an interesting graph

83
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,680
here so we have the number of

84
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:19,019
individuals here on the y-axis and here

85
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,280
we have the depth of their beak which

86
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:25,200
see here were measuring so in 1976 the

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,289
average beak depth you could see here

88
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,060
was it was around nine and a half

89
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:33,419
however comparing that we have a lot of

90
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,640
individuals there to 1978 notice the

91
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,339
average beak death increased tuesday

92
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,879
little over 10 millimeters there's a

93
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,090
shift in the average break beak depth

94
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,099
I'm sorry due to a drought so this

95
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,200
environment is influencing some of this

96
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,620
the drought will cause the insects

97
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:56,009
potentially to go deeper into soil and

98
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,859
we see here in our dry and wet ear how

99
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:01,108
it changes our beak depth in millimeters

100
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,629
so depending on the environmental

101
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,459
conditions a year to year based on the

102
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:08,039
food items that can influence the

103
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,420
individuals beat deaths and what we see

104
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:15,120
here is in 1976 a very large population

105
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:17,339
went into a much smaller population but

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,358
of that population the vast majority had

107
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,949
a larger beak depth and that allows them

108
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,259
to more efficiently feed on food

109
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,969
additives and the grants research

110
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,420
supported Darwin's hypothesis so the

111
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,900
support

112
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,890
by not just dawned on other scientists

113
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,149
populations and gene pools the general

114
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,610
concepts terms you should be familiar

115
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:37,889
with population is simply a localized

116
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,629
group of interpreting individuals the

117
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,579
gene pulls the collection of alleles in

118
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:43,860
the population remember the difference

119
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:46,079
between alleles and genes here's an

120
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,330
example of our genes and here's our

121
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,879
alternate alleles dreams are just the

122
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,500
specific DNA sequences alleles are

123
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,810
referred to the actual phenotype that we

124
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,689
see in the allele frequency is how

125
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,069
common that allele is in the population

126
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:01,009
how many capital is versus how many

127
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:04,769
lowercase A's in the entire population

128
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:06,839
so that's allele frequency lastly

129
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:09,689
there's five agents for evolutionary

130
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:12,689
change ones mutations that occur in this

131
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:15,750
case UV light is an example gene flow or

132
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:18,019
we have genes being inherited or added

133
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,819
in this case to a different population

134
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:22,409
non-random mating what this means is we

135
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,560
see an individual here we see two males

136
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:29,160
one female non-random this female is

137
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:33,089
selecting for this male that has a show

138
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,220
year feathers here so it's not a random

139
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:37,589
she's specifically selecting for that

140
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,020
male and we see the offspring are gonna

141
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:42,359
have traits similar to that one and

142
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,209
that's going to be passed on this other

143
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,800
individuals satellite selected against

144
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:49,319
then we have genetic drift we're seeing

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,540
a shift in this case towards the blue

146
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,000
circles here away from the red circles

147
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,670
so that's genetic drift and this whole

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,290
idea of selection what based on the

149
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,270
environment will may one individual

150
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,910
blend in better alignment to avoid

151
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:07,009
predators for those genes to be passed

152
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,010
on to the following generations
