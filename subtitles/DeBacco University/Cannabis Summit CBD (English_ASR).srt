1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,278
going to look a little bit at the

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:16,320
product called

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:19,198
summit cbd derived from cannabis

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,600
let's look into summit cbd product here

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,080
so

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,760
this is a product produced by ct pharma

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,518
and what's great is that they provide

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,039
analytical reports and labels for the

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,118
products they produce online

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,720
the descriptions options and uses are

12
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,320
intended to provide an understanding of

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,960
some of the end products of the cannabis

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,000
plant

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,600
and here we're going to be looking at

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,880
the summit cbd which is one of their

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,160
higher cbd

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,719
content products so what's the general

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,000
description while cbd is illegally

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,920
available in the us

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,759
many of the cbd products you will find

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,480
do not undergo rigorous testing

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,000
that ct pharma's summit cbd line offers

24
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,759
what's great about the testing that they

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,719
have they also provide it publicly

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,399
available

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,160
the cbd flower looks very similar to

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,120
their premium flower however

29
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,878
test with little to no active thc is

30
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:07,280
intended to have high

31
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:09,359
cbd levels the summit cbd line offers

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
consumers access to the medical benefits

33
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,640
of cannabis without the

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,439
psychoactive feeling and that can be a

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,640
great thing that many are looking for

36
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,959

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,560

43
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,200
university and we cover these just in

44
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,280
general

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,040
as far as products goes so you can just

46
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,719

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960

what are the uses for summit cbd well

49
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,239
since it has

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,759
basically no psychoactive effects making

51
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,118
it very appealing to the consumer who

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,759
wants to feel the relief from their

53
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,280
symptoms

54
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,759
without being overwhelmed with the

55
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,000
psychoactive aspect of cannabis

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,319
it's often used by first-time patients

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,040
or patients coming from a non-cannabis

58
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,519
background so it's a great kind of entry

59
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
uh

60
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,158
option for those people now for those

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,079
entry people as well as for his

62
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,799
experienced people everyone should be

63
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,239
asking or

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,640
making sure that the products they're

65
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,318
using have some sort of certificate of

66
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,919
analysis with them

67
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,000
and if they don't come with one

68
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,598
requesting one and hopefully getting one

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,159
what's on that test we're looking at

70
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,919
micro microbiology testing mycotoxins

71
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,479
heavy metals pesticides

72
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,000
making sure that all they have passed

73
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,719
all of those particular

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,759
parameters in addition yes we may be

75
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,159
looking at the

76
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,679
in this case the cbd profiles we might

77
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,598
be looking at some of the other things

78
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,120
but making sure it's a what's called a

79
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,199
clean or certified product

80
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,959
is important now a lot of times this

81
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,318
will be summarized on the label

82
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
as we can see here hopefully it's

83
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,479
summarized on the label

84
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,400
these are all great things to be looking

85
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,399
for as an educated consumer

86
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
and just remembering that not only do

87
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,680
you have the label to look at

88
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,839
but you can also hopefully have a link

89
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,840
or access to the actual original

90
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
paperwork certifying where the

91
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
information and numbers came

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,200
for that label just as part of you being

93
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,759
a well-educated

94
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,759
and well-informed consumer
