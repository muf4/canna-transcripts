1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,830
in this video we look at some ways

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,899
respiration rates are affected looking

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,890
mainly at plants but I want you to

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,589
remember that this also occurs in

5
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,058
animals and our respiration rate we may

6
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:14,730
think of like our breaths per minute as

7
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,829
a way to measure respiration and that's

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,079
one way and you can see here by the age

9
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:21,198
of an individual in so looking at humans

10
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,399
the breaths per minute does change

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,859
newborns to 6 weeks have the highest

12
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,198
breast permit anywhere from 30 to 60 is

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,050
considered normal and as we age our

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,079
breast from and decrease with adults

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,700
being somewhere in the range of 12 to 20

16
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,170
we can see our dogs here one sitting

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,390
nice in the Sun Prarie their lower

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,429
respiration rate and this dog running

19
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,590
here in the track

20
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:45,899
so again respiration rate relate to

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,120
plants looking at three environmental

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,969
factors here first one being temperature

23
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,619
when air temperature goes from 68 86

24
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,439
degrees Fahrenheit the respiratory rate

25
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,448
can double this is biological system in

26
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,718
general temperatures above 104 degrees

27
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:01,920
Fahrenheit can activate most enzymes

28
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,719
remember there's specific proteins at

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,269
this spend that depend on a very

30
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,570
specific shape above 104 degrees

31
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,679
Fahrenheit those proteins can denature

32
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,688
refrigeration temperatures slow the

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,110
respiration process reducing sugar and

34
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:17,309
water loss unwanted micro isn't

35
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:20,099
microorganism growth can also be reduced

36
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,560
and overall survival time can be

37
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,079
increased since why we store food in the

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,780
refrigerator to help increase its shelf

39
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,700
life by reducing the temperature water

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,099
is another way can in depth aspiration

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,820
rate in living cells about ninety

42
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,949
percent water

43
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,258
remember those seeds are also living

44
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,390
they only contain about 10 percent water

45
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,239
they're still respiring but at a very

46
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,450
low rate so we want to think about their

47
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,298
rate of respiration can affect where a

48
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,118
plant may be in its stage and seeds are

49
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,520
aspiring even oats are very slow or low

50
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,709
rate flooding rich so as these trees

51
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,868
have experience can stun trees and kill

52
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:00,569
plants really reducing respiration rate

53
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:03,420
essentially choking out the plants roots

54
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:06,179
need to breathe need to exchange oxygen

55
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,710
with carbon dioxide when these tree

56
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,140
roots became flooded that was no longer

57
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:13,128
possible in these plants are these trees

58
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:16,318
actually suffocated

59
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:17,818
oxygen is our last factor we look at

60
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,639
when we talk about respiration rate

61
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:23,759
reducing the overall oxygen content 1 a

62
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,399
3% in increased storage time in a sealed

63
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,810
environment particularly for Apple's

64
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,180
oxygen gas can we place with nitrogen

65
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,688
gas as a way to reduce the respiration

66
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,180
rate and increase the shelf life of

67
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:38,299
apples apples it's possible to actually

68
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,769
keep them about a full calendar year

69
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,049
under these conditions that will reduce

70
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,150
their respiration rate the reason why

71
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,620
they tend not to do that is the fresh

72
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,299
apples are usually coming out and the

73
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,259
stored ones don't taste quite as good as

74
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,260
the fresh the victims
