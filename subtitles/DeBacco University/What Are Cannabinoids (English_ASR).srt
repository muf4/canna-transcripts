1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
going to answer the simple question

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,558
what are cannabinoids now we're going to

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,000
go investigate this in a little detail

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,479
so hopefully you come along

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,359
and are able to learn just what are

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
cannabinoids

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,919
related to cannabis plants

9
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:24,479
[Music]

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,920
all right let's get to the main event

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,480
why you probably came here to answer the

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,199
question

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
what are cannabinoids well first off we

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,079
need to understand there's something

15
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,759
called

16
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,920
photocannabinoids um as well so

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,839
photocannabis are a secondary metabolite

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,679
produced by many plants and

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
liverworts as well however they are

20
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,159
producing the greatest concentrations

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,800
and

22
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,199
variations in cannabis sativa

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,439
photocannabinoids are bioactive

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,920
terpenoids which were thought to be

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,439
exclusive to cannabis sativa but now

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,280
have also been discovered in

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,238
rhododendron species as well as some

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,480
legumes

29
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,399
liverworts genus as well as some fungi

30
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,599
as well so it's not just cannabis even

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,239
though here we are relating them to

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
cannabis

33
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,079
simply because they've been found to

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
produce in the greatest concentrations

35
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,359
now some of those photocannabinoids here

36
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,079
might be familiar with

37
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,200
cbd thc probably the two most famous

38
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,959
ones but there's also

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,439
cbc thca cbg as well as

40
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:22,478
others and they're involved in kind of

41
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,719
the neurological pathways and receptors

42
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:27,280
of the human body so we get into

43
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,879
cannabinoids or photocannabinoids what's

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,478
the correct term to use

45
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,920
well photocannabinoids are any

46
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,840
cannabinoid that's produced in the

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,400
trichomes of the cannabis plant

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,240
photocannabinoids are fatty acids

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,118
synthesized in the trichomes of cannabis

50
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,039
sativa

51
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,560
and also in the trichomes of multiple

52
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,079
other species

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,799
photocannabinoids interact with our

54
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,599
body's receptors to produce numerous

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,360
therapeutic effects and cannabinoids are

56
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,559
a class of lithophilic

57
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,280
molecules that interact with the body's

58
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,960
endocannabinoid system

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,320
typically abbreviated ecs often use

60
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,718
however these are often used as

61
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,000
interchangeable terms endocannabinoids

62
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,759
are what are produced

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,519
in animals so we have the endoca

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,639
cannabinoids and that's made

65
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,919
by the body because endo means within

66
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,839
and then we have the photocontaminants

67
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,238
because photo means made by

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,039
photo made by plants the photosynthetic

69
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,319
process

70
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,639
now we have the endocannabinoids which

71
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,159
are brain derived the photocannabinoids

72
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,919
and then we also can't forget about

73
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,400
synthetic cannabinoids and there's our

74
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,679
pharmaceutical lab created they all

75
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,319
interact with the

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,920
endocannabinoid receptors of the body

77
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,238
they kind of like oversimplify that we

78
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,759
have cb1 and cb2 receptors

79
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
different shapes because shape

80
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,799
determines function that's how we bind

81
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,159
and that's how we're looking at the

82
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,959
importance of the shape of these

83
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,439
molecules

84
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,000
to interrupt for their interaction with

85
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,800
the body's neurological system

86
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
so properties our photocadabinoids are

87
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,160
mostly

88
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
insoluble in water but are soluble in

89
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,159
alcohol

90
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,159
and fat and other non-polar organic

91
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,400
solvents so fats being a lipid those are

92
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,560
nonpolar in alkaline conditions

93
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,319
they can form water soluble petal salts

94
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,920
which are essentially phenols

95
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,839
and the phenol groups are represented

96
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,119
either by this or look like this

97
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
and just to take you back to little

98
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,719
biology polar versus nonpolar solvents

99
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
polar solvents are like water there is a

100
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,400
kind of positive negative

101
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,439
n nonpolar silence are kind of like the

102
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
they don't really have

103
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,560
a charge there and separation there's no

104
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,239
charge separation

105
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,080
where polar as a partial positive

106
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,920
negative charge is observed

107
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,680
so just kind of look at some of the

108
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,158
physical properties

109
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,799
of these cannabinoids now just an

110
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,479
overview

111
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,680
of the cannabis as i mentioned probably

112
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,479
familiar with thc cbn cbg cbd things

113
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,840
like that

114
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,719
overview of the cannabinoids here

115
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,439
derived in different kind of backbone

116
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,039
areas here the black structures here and

117
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,479
the black outlines have been isolated

118
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,639
from natural sources

119
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,759
blue structures located right over here

120
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,759
have not been found

121
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,959
in plants and those are kind of your

122
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,039
alcohol

123
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,239
derivatives there so again the reason

124
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,759
why i show this is this

125
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
shape determines function and that's

126
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,359
really important understand the shape

127
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,000
if you want to know the shape it can not

128
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,439
really provide a lot of information here

129
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,318
but just to kind of give you that

130
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,079
information so you have access to it

131
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,839
we also have side chain cannabinoids

132
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,799
which are sc canaanites typically

133
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,399
abbreviated

134
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,319
and in general side change canals of

135
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,439
cannabis sativa can be divided into ten

136
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,279
general groups

137
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,040
and these are some ones we might be more

138
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,239
familiar with where the delta nine

139
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,040
delta eight thc uh as i said

140
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,639
cbd cbc cbg these are all also could be

141
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,000
classified as what's called side chain

142
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,840
cannabinoids

143
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,079
now why are cannabinoids produce just

144
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,679
the great kind of step away picture well

145
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,680
plants produce cannabinoids as a form of

146
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,519
defense against insect feeding

147
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
and or a stressful environmental

148
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,758
conditions which can include

149
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,559
uv light as well as water stress in the

150
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,040
form of

151
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,439
desiccation in the human body produces

152
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
candidates also for survival through

153
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,478
activation of homeostasis which is that

154
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,918
balancing there so

155
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,359
here we have our cannabinoid receptors

156
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,039
we have our photocannabinoids we kind of

157
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
need to have this like check and balance

158
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
system to maintain the all-important

159
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,160
homeostasis

160
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,639
within any living system lastly

161
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,680
connecting cannabinoids to humans

162
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,400
cannabinoids are

163
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,319
the bio are bioactive in human beings in

164
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,799
the sense that they bind to the

165
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,719
endogenous cannabinoid system or ecs

166
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,280
which results in the plethora of

167
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,039
physiological responses the effect of

168
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,279
these drugs can treat many different

169
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,839
diseases ranging from inflammation

170
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,758
to anxiety and many others we'll cover

171
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,359
some more of these uh in other videos

172
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,560
