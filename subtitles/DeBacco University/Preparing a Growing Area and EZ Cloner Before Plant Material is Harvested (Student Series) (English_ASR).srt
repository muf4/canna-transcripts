00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
welcome to this debaco university

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,640
student series video we're going to see

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,280
preparing a growing area in easy cloner

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,960
before plant material is harvested so

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,959
it's important to get everything all set

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,160
up ahead of time before you go out and

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,679
harvest the plants you know that's the

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,519
fun part because you want to make sure

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,278
everything's mechanically working and

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,278
ready for your clones

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,118
[Music]

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,960
all right so we're looking at this

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,320
student series video here looking at

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,239
preparing the growing area just to give

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
you a little background information if

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,479
you will this was the general starting

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,359
material and we could see there's a

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,959
hodgepodge of items here so the goal for

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,280
kiara was to turn this collection

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
materials into a functional cloner once

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,160
this test was achieved then plant

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
material could be collected and that

23
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,119
will be on a separate video remember

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,960
it's important to get everything

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,718
mechanically checked and working

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,439
properly then dial in nutrient

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,600
concentrations followed by ph once this

28
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,759
is achieved you can go get the plants

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,840
once you cut your plants you want to be

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,399
having the least amount of time before

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
they enter the cloner so let's see how

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
keira went about setting up this

33
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,280
collection of materials to get the area

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,280
ready for the soon to be cut clones so

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,200
far we only started out with just the

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,118
table and our light support so we had to

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
go out and make sure all of our area

38
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,040
were sanitized so we wiped down both the

39
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,959
top and the bottom and the surrounding

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,880
areas to make sure it's all sanitized

41
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,359
and clean ready to go for our plants so

42
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,839
that there's no cross-contamination

43
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,759
we then hung our light ballasts up onto

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,520
the light support and connected them to

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
each of our lights of course had to

46
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,359
individually go through and plug each of

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,920
them in but each light is different

48
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,359
we're using fluence led lights we made

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,118
sure to have them

50
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,799
evenly spread out so that all of our

51
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,399
plants can get an even amount of light

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
if that doesn't happen then of course

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,560
you're going to have weaker plants which

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,240
we don't want we have one high and we

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,159
have one low just because we don't know

56
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,519
exactly how tall our cloner is going to

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,040
be yet how far they're going to need to

58
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,399
be from the light so that's why we have

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,759
them adjusted differently that's the

60
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,320
good thing about the ratchet light

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,920
hangers because they're adjustable so

62
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,478
depending on how the plant is growing

63
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,840
you can move them accordingly

64
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,239
now we're at the stage where we would

65
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,280
test out the light before we actually

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,400
you know get everything set up

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,318
and it looks like they're working

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,840
perfectly so now this is the step where

69
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,560
we would grab our cloner and start

70
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,560
setting it up on the table

71
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,799
after we're done setting up our lights

72
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,799
we're going to set up our easy cloner so

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,879
the first step to do that is to fill it

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,280
with as much water as required this one

75
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,919
i'd say takes about 10 gallons but

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,598
before we do we want to take the tap

77
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,238
water that we are planning to use

78
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,518
anyways and test it using our guardian

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,400
meter this reads for conductivity ph and

80
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,239
temperature

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,599
like i said before this water is

82
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,039
straight out of the tap so our

83
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,719
conductivity is reading low at 120 quite

84
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,239
the opposite for the ph it's reading a

85
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:04,000
little high at 8.1 so for what we're

86
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,120
going to do first is adjust our

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,280
conductivity with our clonex grow

88
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
solution

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,199
this will help us adjust our

90
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,959
conductivity to be raised higher the

91
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,079
reason that we would choose to do the

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,319
conductivity before the ph is that the

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,640
this solution has a direct impact on our

94
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,798
ph so while we're trying to massively

95
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,359
change our conductivity from 200

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,239
somewhere up to 600 we're just dialing

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,959
in very slightly with the ph up and down

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,120
just a few so like i said just make sure

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,239
we go into our next step first of all

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,158
adjusting the conductivity

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,680
before we go about adjusting anything

102
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,840
with the water we want to make sure that

103
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,599
it's at a proper level so that our

104
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,039
aeroponics filter actually works we

105
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,518
wouldn't want it to be too high or too

106
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,079
low so that nothing is really working as

107
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,719
it should this wants to spray up at the

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,080
bottom of the plants so that each of the

109
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,919
roots get

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,000
them the nutrients that they need given

111
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,598
up to them and if the water level isn't

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,158
correct then this won't function

113
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,238
correctly we just tested it and it works

114
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,639
properly you could see this because all

115
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,239
of it's dripping as it should be if it

116
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,079
wasn't then we would have to adjust the

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,759
water level higher or lower before

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,639
adding nutrients to make sure it's at

119
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,639
the proper level

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,360
so now we need to raise our conductivity

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,520
levels and lower our ph so in order to

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,600
do this we're going to add our clonex

123
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,279
clone solution

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,080
the bottle recommends adding

125
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:45,119
5 to 10 milliliters per each liter of

126
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,680
water so i have my recommended amount

127
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,600
pre-ready to go

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,600
i'm just going to add that slowly in

129
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,519
and we're just going to wait a little

130
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,478
bit to see how it adjusts the

131
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:11,839
conductivity after that we can go in

132
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,839
with our ph up and down and fix the ph

133
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,199
so now we just wait

134
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,879
so as you can see

135
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,439
our p our conductivity has raised to 770

136
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,519
which is the perfect level and our ph is

137
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,560
at a 6.6 which again is right in the

138
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,560
middle of where we want it to be

139
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,918
you
