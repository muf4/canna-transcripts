1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,480
thank you for checking out another video

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,000
here on tobacco university

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,240
this video we're going to look at

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
measuring bones to estimate height which

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,039
can be applicable for a skeleton that's

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,400
found

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,279
or you can also try this yourself to see

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,160
how well the

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,480
math or measurements come out so here

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,039
we're looking at a single bone

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,719
to individual height so by measuring a

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,400
single bone the estimated height of the

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,079
angel can be calculated

14
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,000
it's important to be able to properly

15
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,518
identify the bone to know the formula

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,679
in the or i should say the correct

17
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,000
formula to use because you can't just

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,159
pick

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,520
any bone there are certain key ones that

20
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,599
a formula has been developed

21
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,399
so you can get a closer estimation of

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,399
the height of the individual

23
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,920
so you want to select a long bone to

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,719
measure and have a couple listed here if

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,480
you remember from

26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,120
long bones the humerus radius the ulna

27
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,439
the femur the tibia or the fibula would

28
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,399
be

29
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,640
bones typically that are used in this

30
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,280
measurement process

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
now looking at race and sex or the

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,920
gender of the individual

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,520
knowing the race and sex of the

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,600
individual of the bone will help

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,040
increase the accuracy of the calculation

36
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,280
because there's different formulas to

37
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,799
apply at a crime scene with an unknown

38
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,879
individual it's important to know that

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,600
some of the identifying characteristics

40
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,839
to aid

41
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,839
in the classification the trained eye

42
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,920
can spot some of these details

43
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,320
and other slideshows will go into detail

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,040
on this to try to be able to determine

45
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,519
an unknown individual to try to classify

46
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
them

47
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,599
as to allow for a greater formula to be

48
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,519
applied with greater accuracy

49
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,679
so as i said you can measure yourself

50
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,039
you can try this out for yourself here

51
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,479
when i stick to one of the long bones

52
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
that you mentioned you want to measure

53
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,359
the bone

54
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,240
length in centimeters and then you want

55
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,560
to use the following

56
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,839
reference table on the following slide

57
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,359
so once you choose one of those bones

58
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,600
you take a measurement

59
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,159
here is kind of an initial kind of

60
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,519
reference table to be able to use

61
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,719
and how you're going to use this well

62
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,158
you want to identify the bone you

63
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,078
measured the humerus the radius

64
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,399
the ulna the femur the tibia or the

65
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,879
fibula when defined one of those bones

66
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,478
measured

67
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,718
you use the measured length in

68
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,000
centimeters the eraser gender is known

69
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,038
if you're looking at a

70
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
skeletal remains and the gender are

71
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,559
known the most

72
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
accurate estimation can be calculated so

73
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,520
here you can just see some of the

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,080
equations whether it's

75
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,800
caucasian african-american asian or

76
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,120
unknown

77
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
and whether it's male or female they are

78
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,480
different

79
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,639
equations to apply there and this will

80
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,878
help provide you with an estimation

81
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,159
of the height of that individual based

82
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,199
on only using

83
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,878
one bone now you can calculate and

84
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,159
measure your height once you calculate

85
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,000
your height and compare it to the actual

86
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,318
height you can see how close it comes

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,039
remember this is only an estimate some

88
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,439
bones

89
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,239
might give you a closer uh or more

90
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,639
accurate

91
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,480
answer but they are all just to give an

92
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,518
estimate to give you a range or an

93
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,399
expected

94
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
approximate height of the individual you

95
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,159
want

96
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,080
questions to consider how does your

97
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,719
calculated height compare to your actual

98
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,840
height

99
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:02,318
and how may this be applied to a unknown

100
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,840
skeletal remains so you may want to use

101
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,639
different bones and find out which one

102
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,840
provides you

103
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:11,039
the more and less accurate results

104
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,400
you know some bones provide a closer to

105
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,719
the actual

106
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
but they're all just an estimation so

107
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,840
which bone for you provided the most

108
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
accurate results
