1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
okay this videos will cut the source and

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,509
sync relationship that plants have to go

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,460
through so a source being mainly leaves

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,199
the sync in this case being the

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,320
developing blackberry and how these

6
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,000
interrelate we look at plants so first

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,649
defining source ankles so our sore

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,439
portions of the plant that are producing

9
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:21,689
more energy particularly sugars than

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,719
they are consuming sinks our net

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,570
consumers of energy so here's our source

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,939
in this case a leaf young leaves can be

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,030
a sink acorns in this case can be a sink

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,429
our roots can be a sink and leaves our

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,799
main areas of source remember fully

16
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:39,420
mature leaves our source tissue the

17
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,359
young leaves can actually be a sink

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,550
themselves so they can be net consumers

19
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:48,929
of energy before they mature then they

20
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:51,839
can be net producers so looking again at

21
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:53,850
some sources these are typically green

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,520
areas going through the process of

23
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,379
converting light energy to sugars this

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,730
is an transport via the xylem these

25
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,000
carbohydrates are assimilated into

26
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:05,640
storage and they can go to roots shoots

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,040
and fruits and all other components

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,200
they're never entering the phloem that

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,380
can go up and down being transported to

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,259
where it's needed so that transportation

31
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,609
process here on carbohydrate transport

32
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,890
is through the process what we call

33
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:24,000
translocation this is the movement of

34
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,680
products of synthesis by phloem so just

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,209
put the picture of the Train here to get

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,390
the idea of moving products we need a

37
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,250
lot of products throughout the plant

38
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,920
so how translocation works well we have

39
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,259
our source leaf here produce some soup

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,859
sucrose companion cells are loading it

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,228
into the phloem within our sieve tube

42
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,868
elements and then that is transported

43
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,399
and moving towards a sink cell where

44
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:49,500
these companion cells are picking up

45
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,570
those sucrose molecules and adding them

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,009
to the sink cell we also notice when we

47
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,258
increase our concentration of sugar

48
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,670
water will move across and we decrease

49
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,938
our concentration of sugar water will

50
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,799
move back to this eylem the basic

51
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:03,868
equation for the entire post synthetic

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,820
process can reckon spend a lot of time

53
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,429
on that now that's coming up in future

54
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:11,598
and other videos you'd like to watch

55
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,740
those photosynthesis is carbon dioxide

56
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,649
plus water

57
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,469
utilizing light energy to form sugar and

58
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:24,840
oxygen now the reason why it's six co2

59
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:25,500
plus 602 and light producing a c6 h-12

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,770
o-6

61
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,080
sugar molecule plus six oxygens is this

62
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,760
balances the equation so there's the

63
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,100
same number of carbons hydrogen's and

64
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,049
oxygens on this side as there are on

65
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,329
this side this is why the coefficients

66
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,360
are necessary here who did this six

67
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,620
carbon complex sugar the process of

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,930
emitting the light energy to produce

69
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,430
chemical energy in this case sugar and

70
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,650
that's what we're seeing here it is

71
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,219
refined sugars cubes but you kind of get

72
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,659
the idea of what's going on here most of

73
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,030
the system generals that capture of

74
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,430
light energy we notice that that can go

75
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,340
through and form starch or sugar storage

76
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,010
organs and sense of our tubers I can be

77
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,550
used for starch which is sugar storage

78
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:10,409
in an organ on a tomato in this case so

79
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,140
we can see there's a lot of things going

80
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:15,389
on here and this how this source sync

81
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:16,769
relationship plays into the plant it's

82
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,759
not just going from one area to another

83
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:23,040
on there's a lot of factors in play here

84
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,919
so in general sucrose is typically used

85
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,909
for a long distance transport

86
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:28,919
long-distance transport of carbohydrates

87
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,020
it's mainly in the phloem it's been in

88
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,149
the form of sucrose sucrose is a

89
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,730
disaccharide of glucose and fructose

90
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,450
being linked together in long distance

91
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:43,530
transport a source cell all the way to

92
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,909
some sort of sink cell so the strength

93
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,590
of sugar traction the ability of an

94
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:49,109
organ to unload sugar from the phloem

95
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,629
determines the sinks strength so here's

96
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,250
a sig cell the root sync strength is how

97
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,199
aggressive is that going to be at

98
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,469
grabbing sugars and pulling them from

99
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:01,530
the phloem in this case different

100
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:03,389
sources are six different cells I should

101
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,800
say or sinks and the sink strength

102
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:07,019
refers to the ability or the

103
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,380
aggressiveness of grabbing those sugars

104
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,340
and pulling them towards themselves

105
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:13,079
meristems are the say of actually

106
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,819
dividing cells from a new tissue and

107
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,540
typically found in the growing tips of

108
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,730
roots and shoots

109
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,439
there's apical and lateral meristems

110
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,910
they should look familiar from some of

111
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,790
the future or some of the previous

112
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,340
videos and repeats discussing the noun

113
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,330
into the future and these are examples

114
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,310
of beara stones

115
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:33,810
require a lot of energy so typically

116
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,968
sources of sink areas so cell division

117
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,610
drives the same strength cell division

118
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:40,439
will increase the sink size the source

119
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,479
sink relationship will affect the entire

120
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,430
plant you kind of show here with our

121
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,918
little output our big apple on a little

122
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,780
plant here so you have a lot of sink

123
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:50,158
strength and that's gonna drive a lot of

124
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:52,859
the processes that the plant goes

125
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:54,930
through so again remember our xylem and

126
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,968
phloem there are vascular connections I

127
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,400
was moving water from the roots to the

128
00:04:56,968 --> 00:05:01,468
shoots then phloem is moving mainly

129
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:05,429
carbohydrates up and down in close

130
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:07,228
proximity to contain themselves the

131
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,090
phloem the vascular tissue is transport

132
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:11,128
sugars to other medibot and other

133
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:13,978
metabolic products it can move materials

134
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:16,620
up and down the plant so again as we see

135
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:19,500
here our sieve tube elements and our

136
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,949
companion cells these are all involved

137
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,759
in the phloem in the movement of

138
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,658
carbohydrates and other metabolic

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,669
products the pressure flow model well

140
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:31,319
sugar enters the phloem via active

141
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:33,240
transport were actively adding their

142
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,639
sucrose molecules as the sugar

143
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,400
concentration increases water will enter

144
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,740
the sip tube cells from the xylem by

145
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,378
osmosis then the pressure will increase

146
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,750
inside this area and push the sugars

147
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,330
through the phloem and sugar will move

148
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,579
from the phloem to a sink by the process

149
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:52,109
of active transport you notice now that

150
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:53,338
we're removing our sugar the waters

151
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,288
moving back across

152
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:58,110
remember our xylem contains more than

153
00:05:55,288 --> 00:06:01,588
just water there's also minerals in the

154
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,240
xylem and that's what is helping drive

155
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:05,418
the water movement through the process

156
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,069
of osmosis

157
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:09,838
so phloem loading this this is the

158
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:12,028
process where sugars enter the phloem at

159
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:14,250
a source point so in some plant sugar

160
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:16,860
moves on sugar producing cells into

161
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,319
companion cells in the sieve tube

162
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,288
elements via plasmodesmata where these

163
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,819
are holes in the actual cell wall you

164
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:25,468
see that here companion cell moving it

165
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,389
through the plasma is another so called

166
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,699
sim classic phloem load this is

167
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:33,028
partially apple plastic phloem loading

168
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:35,550
in some plants this is her sugar moves

169
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:36,389
from sugar producing cells in the into

170
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,819
the apple class

171
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,468
ATP is required we see that right here

172
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,520
for an active transport into the

173
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:44,248
companions

174
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,188
sugar moves into this sieve-tube cell

175
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:49,110
elements via transporter proteins via

176
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:52,080
the plasmodesmata so here we're having

177
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:55,619
those energy required that ATP being

178
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,908
broke down ADP to allow this to occur so

179
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:59,099
both are accomplishing the same end

180
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:04,558
result where we're getting our sugars

181
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:06,178
into the flow now certain insects will

182
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:07,559
take advantage of this Athens in

183
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:09,568
particular and a Taurus

184
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:12,319
for using a stylet which is this kind of

185
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:15,479
long piercing mouth part as we see here

186
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,249
to tap into the phloem the if it cuts

187
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,498
into the phloem a lot and SAP to easily

188
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:22,199
be consumed they're trying to consume

189
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:23,519
the sugars that are within the plant so

190
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,679
that's why they're specific they have

191
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,538
mouth parts that penetrate the phloem

192
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:31,348
and then what's call of insects they are

193
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:32,699
flown with feeders just referring back

194
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:35,338
remember sugars carbohydrates

195
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,079
carbohydrates or saccharides there are

196
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:38,999
many different types of sugars sucrose

197
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,579
is mostly used in the transport of

198
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:43,259
implants sucrose is formed when monomer

199
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:44,879
of glucose and monomer approaches are

200
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,879
joined together through the process of

201
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,369
dehydration synthesis dehydration is the

202
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:54,509
removal of water we see a hydroxide

203
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:56,329
group and hydrogen ion o H and H come

204
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:58,379
together to form water

205
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:01,319
dehydration that's losing the water

206
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,579
molecule and creating this bond here and

207
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,679
that's what's allowing these two

208
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:08,788
monomers to be joined together to form

209
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:10,038
sucrose which is a disaccharide lastly I

210
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:13,318
think this image is pretty interesting

211
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:16,050
or noticing that cell growth is a

212
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,598
consequence of sugar import from the

213
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,269
common simulate pool according to the

214
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:24,538
source sync concept so what does this

215
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:27,598
mean well cell growth is a consequence

216
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:29,759
of the sugar import so we have this

217
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,429
radiograph here what this image shows is

218
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,079
labeled sugar molecules so a

219
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,179
concentration two and a half hours after

220
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:38,250
tracer molecules were fed to older

221
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,620
leaves in the plant so we went to

222
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,349
initially the scientists added on sugar

223
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,929
molecules to older leaves red areas

224
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,759
indicate an area of high concentration

225
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:49,649
so you see that here the red color

226
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,470
indicates high level of beta particles

227
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:53,639
in those sugars in the radio activity

228
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,899
again this doesn't mean that all plants

229
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,840
are radioactive this is

230
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:00,029
an example of scientists labeling

231
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,410
certain sugar molecules to be able to

232
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:04,139
help trace them and see where they end

233
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:06,629
up the key your take-home message here

234
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,370
is that the concentration of in young

235
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,769
leaves the image indicates that these

236
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,539
are fast-growing young leaves drew the

237
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:15,179
radioactive sugars from the older leaves

238
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:18,299
so this indicates young leaves are

239
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:21,089
actually a sink cell there are pulling

240
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:23,009
sugars from the older leaves so just

241
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,440
because it's elite does it mean it's

242
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:27,870
always a source cell young leaves into

243
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,400
developing they're actually consuming

244
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,889
more sugars than they're initially

245
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,350
producing ultimately when these beech

246
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:36,509
maturity they will produce more and

247
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,200
become a source for the plant to allow

248
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:41,610
it to be able to store it in different

249
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,370
sink cells and those could be tubers

250
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,560
those could be fruits or other regions

251
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,440
in the plant but initially young leaves

252
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,949
are actually a sink before they fully

253
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,950
developed
