00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,679
going to be looking at things that go

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,318
beyond just disease that can infect

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,000
plants

5
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,559
we're going to look at some abiotic

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,429
issues which can also reduce yields

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:20,479
and increase plant stresses

8
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,759
[Music]

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,439
all right so here we're going to look at

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,080
common ability issues for cannabis

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,920
plants

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,759
looking at abiotic factors being those

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
non-living components of an ecosystem

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,000
wind

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,238
sunlight soil temperature atmosphere and

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
water are just a few that fall under

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,519
this category

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
it's not always a disease that causes a

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
reduction in yield

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
so general abi characteristics so

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,920
typically symptoms will appear

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,920
suddenly if it is an abiotic issue a

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,960
uniform pattern can also typically be

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,840
observed

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,280
and it's though not common to be only on

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,480
a single plant meaning

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,800
not like you just have one plant that

28
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,119
has an infection you'll see many have

29
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,159
this

30
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,759
issue if you're growing more than one

31
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,839
variety it's possible for there to be a

32
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,719
distinctive difference between varieties

33
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,680
though not always the case lesions tend

34
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,760
to have distinct

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,960
lines of impact and not impacted tissue

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,079
so when these we're looking at our

37
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,158
lesions they tend to have these kind of

38
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,079
harsh lines versus it was a disease

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,680
they can kind of a spreading appearance

40
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,798
to them abiotic factors tend to have a

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,360
little bit more of a harsher

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
line associated with them now what are

43
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,239
some stresses when we're looking at

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,759
abiotic stresses well

45
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,839
they can lead to secondary plant

46
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,959
stresses heat cold heavy metals

47
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,118
nutrients

48
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,118
salinity drought flooding all these can

49
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,200
cause abiotic stresses that lead to

50
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,359
secondary stresses on the plant

51
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
this is a result this causes the damage

52
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,640
of the plant that can be seen

53
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,239
all these factors these secondary

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,399
stresses can lead to cell death

55
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,839
accumulation survival and other negative

56
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
impacts

57
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
so looking at shoot related about this

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
is what's occurring on the top of the

59
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,759
plant

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,599
well heat can come from light that could

61
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,719
be artificial or even the sun can cause

62
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,158
heat stress

63
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,239
there's also cold which is a

64
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,399
particularly concern early in the late

65
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,000
in outdoor growing for indoor grows

66
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,320
watch the lights off temperature

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,319
and be sure you're moderating that as

68
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,878
another video here on tobacco university

69
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,120
looking at the

70
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,920
relationship of frost which is cold

71
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,878
damage on

72
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,238
outdoor grown cannabis now root zone

73
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,159
about x dresses

74
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,840
there are many we see the nutrients

75
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,840
oftentimes growers over feed their

76
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,159
plants leading to nutrient toxicities

77
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,920
which is a plant stressor there's heavy

78
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,120
metals this is tested in the final plant

79
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,519
material so be sure no

80
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,280
your substrate and your inputs are so

81
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
you're limiting the chance of having any

82
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
potential heavy metal stress on your

83
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,759
root structure

84
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,200
salinity this can happen with chemical

85
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,199
organic fertilizers

86
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,280
so be watchful for the of this in

87
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,399
flushing plants is advised to reduce the

88
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,000
salt concentration

89
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,000
if it does get to a level that is

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,519
causing plant stress

91
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
drought which is sometimes not

92
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,039
intentional but be sure to check each

93
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,720
plant to ensure the irrigation system

94
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,479
you're using is fully functional

95
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,080
as well as flooding which can be caused

96
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,919
by damage to an irrigation line or

97
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,879
simply over watering plants so be sure

98
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,559
to get a feel

99
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,318
for the substrate for each individual

100
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
plant to make sure you're not over or

101
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,359
under watering it

102
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,879
all these are kind of root zone stresses

103
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,879
with the above ground stresses

104
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,120
eliminating and being mindful of these

105
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,199
and reducing these stresses on the plant

106
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,080
will help improve plant efficiency as

107
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,079
well as yield
