00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,279
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,120
video

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,719
in this video we're going to explore

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,480
cannabis lane land

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,320
race strains and we're going to explain

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,800
them kind of what they are and define

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,559
them

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,160
to provide you with some information as

9
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,320
well as a little history

10
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,679
into cannabis here specifically you may

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,679
have heard of

12
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,960
land race strains so what does that

13
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,839
actually term mean

14
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,599
learn about that here so starting off

15
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,518
land race is simply kind of a way of

16
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,199
saying an original strain

17
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,198
so elena's marijuana strain is

18
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,160
considered to be one of the original

19
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,880
strains

20
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,919
that can date back to the 1960s and even

21
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
earlier

22
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,640
these land race strains typically carry

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,039
the name of the geographic location

24
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
that they were thought to originate from

25
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,159
we see a couple listed

26
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,398
right here again depending what region

27
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,238
of the world these original strains they

28
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,359
kind of get that geographic kind of name

29
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,679
associated with them

30
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,119
to give an idea of where they may have

31
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,719
started

32
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,320
now landry stream did have some

33
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
isolation so

34
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,920
sativa land race strains moved all

35
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
across the globe they were ones that

36
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,640
were pretty mobile to pretty tolerant of

37
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,040
a lot of conditions

38
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
where indica land races were isolated to

39
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,040
the arid mountainous regions

40
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,158
typically found around afghanistan and

41
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240
pakistan

42
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,159
it wasn't until the 1970s where these

43
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,798
streams were actually bred together

44
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,960
to kind of create some hybrids and kind

45
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,960
of causes a little bit of confusion as

46
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,158
well start identifying or tracing these

47
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,280
back much further

48
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,400
than the 1960s now the breeding process

49
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,560
just in general the breeding a

50
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
and selecting process was able to slowly

51
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,159
remove unwanted characteristics while

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,079
retaining the desired traits to be

53
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,640
expressed more consistently

54
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,078
this is through that again that multiple

55
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,959
traveling throughout the world multiple

56
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,919
grows

57
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,399
and ultimately a selection key traits

58
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,478
were

59
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
bred for that are still in focus of many

60
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,438
growers today so

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,799
resistance to disease is a very

62
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,559
important one and overall plant

63
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,320
production are kind of the two main ones

64
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,159
that readers are still trying to always

65
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,679
work on and refine

66
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,439
this has resulted in the majority of the

67
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,360
current plants being a mixture

68
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,959
of the original laminate strains to

69
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,000
create hybrids as they mentioned

70
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,758
earlier now land races of cannabis

71
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
are kind of like the air heirlooms of

72
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,839
cannabis in the sense that from the

73
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,920
1960s they're not grown on really a

74
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,439
large scale today those original ones

75
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,199
however there are some purists that kind

76
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,598
of keep the strains alive in the current

77
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,439
genetic pool within the plant population

78
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,519
i relate this to kind of like maybe very

79
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,598
familiar with like heirloom tomatoes

80
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,360
these particular tomatoes may not yield

81
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,079
the best or have certain qualities that

82
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,480
might be

83
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,680
advantageous but also some drawbacks but

84
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,840
kind of to preserve

85
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,719
that kind of original strains original

86
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,120
genetics

87
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,199
they are still continued to be grown

88
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
this day for incorporation to hybrids

89
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,679
or grown to the final end product

90
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
themselves now just some common elements

91
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,120
strains related to marijuana again i

92
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,159
mentioned a whole bunch that were listed

93
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,519
earlier these are just

94
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,318
a few random examples here of the many

95
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,599
options

96
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,280
so hopefully this provides you with a

97
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,238
little bit of background on what a land

98
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
race stream is

99
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,080
regarding cannabis and give you just a

100
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,959
little bit of that background so now

101
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,840
when you hear the term

102
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,840
give a better understanding
