1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
on this debaco university student series

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,719
video we're going to look at properly

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,559
taking clones from outdoor plants now

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,400
just a couple things to keep in mind

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,399
that while this can be done at any point

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,638
during the day or night times of low

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,278
light are advised we're going to see the

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,919
video going forward taking right as the

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,759
sun was setting as the sun intensity was

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,840
coming off the plants reducing the

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,439
stress to them we're also going to see

12
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,320
the difference between taking a branch

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,160
clone and a meristem clone so the main

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,079
difference is you've got your main stock

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,600
the branch clone is going to be cloning

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,359
one of those plant materials that comes

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,640
directly off that and when you take a

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,238
meristem clone what you're doing is

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,520
you're cutting at a node in hopes of

20
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,519
encouraging two more branches to form

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,320
there so it allows you to take more

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,719
clones later as the plant develops so

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,799
hopefully you enjoyed this series and

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,760
you can see the comparison between the

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:57,558
two and improves your own success when

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,558
you're looking through in cloning

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,090
[Music]

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
so now i'm going to be showing you how

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
to take the actual clone from a cannabis

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,478
plant first you're going to want to pick

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,118
the plant you want to clone from this is

32
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,959
a cherry 1 cbg plant

33
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,118
next you're going to want to go into the

34
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,199
plant and try to pick out a specific

35
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,599
branch that you want to cut out to

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,079
become the clone in your cloner

37
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,559
i decided to go with this branch right

38
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,639
here mostly because of its morphology

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
you can see that it's about a hand's

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,719
length long of course that's subject to

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,799
change so depending on how long your

42
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,759
hand is but just about a hand's length

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,759
long it also looks pretty healthy i'm

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,759
going to be taking this branch off of

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,759
the cannabis plant mostly because i

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,519
really appreciate how long the stock is

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,200
it'll be able to become submerged in the

48
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,759
water

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,320
you would try to find where the note is

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,359
the part absolutely closest to the main

51
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,839
stock

52
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,438
and cut the branch as far down and as

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,560
close to the stock as you can right in

54
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,079
the node if possible

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,719
you want to make sure that you have

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,120
clean and sharp trimming pruning

57
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,359
scissors to be able to do this

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,200
since you really want the end to be a

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,000
perfect cut you want it to be able to

60
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:23,479
absorb nutrients and not be all rugged

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,479
it wants to absorb

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,840
so this is a big cbg plant as you can

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,319
see

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,719
i've chosen to take this branch as a

65
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,039
clone due to its morphology it seems to

66
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,120
be doing pretty well doesn't seem to

67
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,679
have any nutrient deficiencies or

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,519
sicknesses bugs that i could tell

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,760
and so what i'm going to do

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,439
is take about a hand's length of the

71
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,120
plant i know that's pretty subjective

72
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,479
but

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
find the node

74
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,238
right where it would connect to

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,719
the main stock so right here we see two

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,200
more branches coming off that's

77
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,800
right before they start growing is where

78
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,479
we want to take our snipping from right

79
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,719
at the node

80
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,639
and so when you're ready

81
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,400
just take your shears

82
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,399
and

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,680
cut

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,319
that's why you want to make sure you

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,319
have very sharp cutting shears

86
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,639
so that once we actually put it in the

87
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,878
cloner everything can penetrate into the

88
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,479
bottom of the stock and it can begin

89
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,479
glowing growing in the cloner

90
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,840
we've just taken the top of this branch

91
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,759
off so that we could clone it and allow

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,759
for these two branches to gain more

93
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,679
nutrients so that they can grow bigger

94
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:46,519
and better and we could eventually take

95
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,519
them as clones like we did this one

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,039
you
