00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
hello welcome to another debaco

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,719
university video

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,719
here we're going to be looking at the

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,359
cannabis naming system that's currently

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,279
in place

6
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,359
and some of the issues involved with

7
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,879
that system when it comes to naming

8
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,558
you can see here's some dried flower

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,519
kind of the name tags here that have

10
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,038
nothing on them

11
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,719
a lot of times even though it may say a

12
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
name on it we may

13
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,479
not have a very valid name and we'll

14
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,160
talk about that here

15
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,000
so first off there's the international

16
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,480
code of nomenclature for cultivated

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
plants this is the icncp

18
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,679
this regulates the naming of plants

19
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,679
whose recent evolution

20
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,799
has been influenced by human selection

21
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,679
so of course this would

22
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,439
apply or pertain to cannabis based on

23
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,238
that definition

24
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,920
however when we're looking at naming

25
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,599
certain types of cannabis a lot of times

26
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,280
we're using the term cultivar

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,800
now when we're using the term cultivar

28
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,198
we have to realize that

29
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,439
this is a unit of classification and it

30
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,079
has a very specific definition

31
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,079
it's an assemblage of plants that a has

32
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,399
been selected for a particular character

33
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,119
or combination of characters b is

34
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,759
distinct

35
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,158
uniform and stable in these characters

36
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,719
and

37
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,439
c when propagated by appropriate means

38
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,158
retains

39
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,959
those characteristics which is when

40
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,040
we're looking

41
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,319
here at different types of cannabis or

42
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,200
any plant in general this means it's

43
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,798
basically

44
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,159
it's a unique form it's a

45
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,799
kind of distinct characteristics and it

46
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,359
is

47
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,080
able to be propagated so this is what

48
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,719
defines

49
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,280
a cultivar now when we're looking at the

50
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,519
room

51
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
the rules for naming a cultivar i want

52
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,000
to think of it kind of like a sports

53
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,319
event here

54
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so the ic ncp his rules for naming

55
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,399
describing cultivars

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,078
involve valid publication typification

57
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,079
and priority

58
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,078
this is available online for

59
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,679
consultation and regarding these

60
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,239
provisions so they are available to kind

61
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
of take

62
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,839
in some feedback and to be able to

63
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,478
provide some uh

64
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,799
suggestions as well cauliflower names

65
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,799
meaning that the icncp provisions

66
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,000
are placed in single quotation marks

67
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,159
it's the proper way

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,640
to kind of scientifically scientific

69
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,320
name for that given plant species

70
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,399
and there's the genus the specific

71
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,120
epithet and then the cultivar

72
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,680
there listed in those single quotes at

73
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,878
the end

74
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,800
we're not talking just about a simple

75
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,560
common name that's basically no rules

76
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,640
and there may be multiple names for the

77
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,318
same plant and this also applies to

78
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,759
animals

79
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,560
now variety form and strain do not equal

80
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,919
the same

81
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,680
as the word cultivar so article 2.2

82
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,318
uh stipulates that the words variety

83
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,239
form and strain must not be used

84
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,759
for the word cultivar cultivar is its

85
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,759
own distinctive kind of

86
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,878
entity strain is not uniformly

87
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,878
recognized

88
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,199
so that's one thing to keep in mind and

89
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:46,159
strains are conceptually identical to

90
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,799
cultivars in concept but almost no

91
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,759
strains have

92
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,439
met the official icncp requirements for

93
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,518
cultivar recognition

94
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,959
and all these sources would be located

95
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,519
in the description here of this video

96
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,120
rules are in place for a reason so like

97
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,640
anything they may we may not agree with

98
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,599
all of them but they are in place for a

99
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,039
reason

100
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,959
there's an argument of the bigger

101
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,759
picture justifies using strain and

102
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,598
cultivar as

103
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,799
equivalent so it's kind of like well

104
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:11,759
where we have these rules let's just

105
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,000
call them the same

106
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,799
thing and that's really not the case

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,318
here

108
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,400
the uh so as a research here small in

109
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,000
2015 reported that they showed

110
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,239
insufficient respect for

111
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,239
codes of nomenclature which hold uh

112
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,680
prametic and moral status

113
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,920
by quoting the botanical codes are by a

114
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,120
large adhered to by scientists

115
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,559
commercial interests

116
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,799
and editors because they provide

117
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,598
stability and reliability to names

118
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,439
that otherwise would result in confusion

119
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,560
so i think the cannabis industry right

120
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,560
now is kind of like

121
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
using the the code is more what we call

122
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,799
guidelines than actual rules when there

123
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,360
are

124
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,920
official rules in place for the proper

125
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,440
naming

126
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,719
and just keep calm and follow those

127
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,039
rules otherwise it's kind of going to

128
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,840
result in a bunch of confusion

129
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,798
which sadly we have a lot of right now

130
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,598
now the strain

131
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,920
names so strains become kind of numerous

132
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,518
they

133
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,039
leafly quoted in 2015 they listed about

134
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,239
1535 straight names seed finder

135
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,959
in the same year listed 6 510 string

136
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
names

137
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
most strains are recognized as hybrids

138
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,879
characterized as sativa

139
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,639
dominant or indica dominant keep in mind

140
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,199
though that strain names are swapped and

141
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,960
counterfeited and generally unreliable

142
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,400
so they're kind of like the picture we

143
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,799
have here with kind of the

144
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,079
celtic sugar around it kind of wind can

145
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,919
come through and it can change

146
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,519
and look completely different and that's

147
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,399
sadly what we're having with these

148
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,879
various strain names in cannabis now

149
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,560
what's in a name will any strain

150
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,918
has not been formally described as a

151
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,759
cultivar for example

152
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,519
the so-called sour diesel should

153
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,560
properly be named as

154
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,719
uh cannabis in italics strain

155
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
sour diesel the population's name is

156
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,840
without single quotation marks remember

157
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
that these names have no

158
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,599
taxonomic validity so just because you

159
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,439
may know it as sour diesel just because

160
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,080
it may be listed on the package of sour

161
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,759
diesel

162
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,199
these really don't have any true

163
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,080
taxonomic scientific

164
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,120
validity to those names now kind of get

165
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,639
into that straining

166
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
variability kind of pointing this out

167
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,319
ak-47 won the best

168
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,800
sativa in the 1999 cannabis cup

169
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,918
and then one best indica four years

170
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,079
later so even

171
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,599
in kind of the cannabis cup of high

172
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,240
times there's been

173
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,520
a single strain that won best sativa and

174
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,600
then four years later it went in one

175
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,359
best indica so this kind of helps

176
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,800
prove that the reliability of these

177
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,038
strains is not really that great

178
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,879
last here we're looking at just some

179
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,199
questionable kind of pedigree

180
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,959
the claimed industry of suprathera

181
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,400
diesel hayes from seed finder

182
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,159
as you kind of go through and read

183
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,198
through here what gives it kind of its

184
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,199
questionable pedigree

185
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,199
so when you see the words like murky

186
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,079
pedigree it's either this or it could be

187
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,680
that

188
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,079
that should throw up us kind of some

189
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,959
caution there of like a red flag like

190
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,758
some things

191
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,560
may not quite be right there and we see

192
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,680
the terms like

193
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,280
likely derived from uh another example

194
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,478
there where just because we know we have

195
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,559
this end product

196
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,599
where actually came from is not really

197
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,439
well defined

198
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,160
and a lot of that goes back to the poor

199
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,160
naming system currently in place
