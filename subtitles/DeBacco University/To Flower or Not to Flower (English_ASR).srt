1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,559
some girls were often wonder should I be

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,699
flowering plants or should I be waiting

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,200
what should I be doing you know when

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,120
should I kind of signal that plant to go

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,440
into flower that's we're look at just a

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,808
couple things that might help you

7
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,599
clarify this and determine when to make

8
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:19,198
that change now keep in mind that photo

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,719
period dictates vegetative or the

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,300
flowering phase for plants so plants can

11
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:27,329
be switched to flower or even reverted

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,339
back to vegetative stage for cloning if

13
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,889
desired by the grower based on the photo

14
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,960
period that they're exposed to so keep

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,120
in mind that for most varieties the

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,410
grower has control so it's up to the

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,799
grower to decide when it's the most

18
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,209
advantageous to make that transition

19
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,488
now that flower timing remember auto

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,179
flowering cultivars will flower based on

21
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:47,549
days old

22
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,409
not on the photo period all others

23
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,259
indicas and sativas will be dependent on

24
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:54,569
the photo period so if you are playing

25
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,698
those auto flowering varieties you don't

26
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,738
have to worry about making the switch to

27
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,468
flower or not you can almost mark on a

28
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,390
calendar or get an approximate idea of

29
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,430
when they should be flowering just to

30
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,530
give you an idea otherwise if you're

31
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,970
growing in the kids RCT is you can kind

32
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,099
of pick or choose the date you want

33
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,280
change the photo period and induced file

34
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,228
flowering on your plants so sometimes

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,450
when a flower depends on simply the room

36
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:20,250
height how tall can your plants and get

37
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,228
you do not want your plants to outgrow

38
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,719
their vertical space so that can

39
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:27,359
indicate or telegrapher when they should

40
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,009
be inducing flowering I know how far the

41
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,049
plant should be from the lights and if

42
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,060
you are ceiling limited it will dictate

43
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,979
when you flip the photo period on them

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,719
so keep in mind especially for some

45
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,599
areas might be in a grow tent or

46
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,118
facility with low ceilings this can help

47
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,069
make this the decision for you if you're

48
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,859
an area here we have a large area you

49
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,478
have more options but sometimes your

50
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,909
lights might be fixed and a certain area

51
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,658
so that can help limit your decisions

52
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:57,899
and allow you to time out the proper

53
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,600
period to switch the vegetative state to

54
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,430
the flower on state you also should know

55
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,968
your cultivar or the general habits of

56
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,860
your plant

57
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:06,539
indicas can grow about twenty-five to

58
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,429
fifty percent more in vertical height

59
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,500
while they earn flower

60
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,699
sativas can potentially double their

61
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,830
height during the flowering stage

62
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,229
keep mine sativas have that kind of

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,600
longer taller appearance in indicas are

64
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,669
more that kind of squatty er appearance

65
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,250
there so again knowing the cultivar that

66
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:26,159
you're using can also help make an

67
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,469
informed decision your starting material

68
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,939
should also be a consideration did the

69
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,330
original plant material come from seed

70
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:35,280
or from a clone clones can grow in

71
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,020
height quickly but make sure if you are

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,419
going from a clone that they do have a

73
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,400
sufficient root system here's two clones

74
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,079
pulled from an aeroponic cloner it see

75
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,730
this one has intruded yet this is just

76
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,130
starting but you wanna let Susan pry go

77
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:49,049
for a little bit longer to allow it to

78
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:52,229
have a sufficient root system to be able

79
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,420
to support itself through the rest of

80
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:55,709
the vegetative phase and so that you

81
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,129
have a healthy plant going into

82
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,129
flowering
