00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,399
going to go over cover crop

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,080
options for cannabis production field

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,320
however this will apply

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,000
to basically any field grown crops as

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,880
cover crops are a great thing to

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,759
incorporate

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,240
as part of a rotation to keep a healthy

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,649
soil

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:25,759
and prevent erosion

11
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:27,358
[Music]

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
all right let's get into some cover crop

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,079
options for field production

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,079
so in general just what is a cover crop

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,920
just in general cover crops are any type

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,399
of plant that's used to protect

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,039
and improve the soil and environment for

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,280
the next

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,799
farming season that does not mean weeds

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,719
fall into this category

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,558
using cover crop mimics nature and keeps

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,879
your ecosystem thriving through the off

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,718
season with roots present in the soil

24
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,198
helping that soil biology to community

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,520
live giving earthworms a sense

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,960
of area to kind of feed off of so again

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
cover crops are a great thing to

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,960
implement

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,640
to really any production field often

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,920
would be recommended here with cannabis

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
because it may not get the attention

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
that it needs

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,118
so what are some of the benefits of

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,880
cover crop well they prevent erosion

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,400
sequester nutrients reduce soil

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,319
compaction suppress

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,439
weed growth well weeds at least you

38
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,359
don't want

39
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,438
and then repel unwanted pests and they

40
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,400
also provide a habitat for beneficial

41
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,118
organisms

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
so there is a lot of advantages to

43
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,719
taking the time to go through

44
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,839
and ensure that you're planting and

45
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,519
establishing a quality cover crop

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,719
so the next question is okay if i want

47
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,158
to go through and do a cover crop what's

48
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,959
the best cover crop

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,479
well often depends on a few factors what

50
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,078
climate are you growing in

51
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,399
what's the duration of growth that you

52
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,599
have and what's benefits the grower

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,519
they're they're seeking you know what

54
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,959
does that feel may need improvement on

55
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,039
that's what determines what quote the

56
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,719
best cover crop would be

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,240
what are some common cover crops so we

58
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,959
see kind of a nice image

59
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,798
set here i'll cover these going rye

60
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,640
triticale winter wheat

61
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,880
clover mustards hairy vetch tillage

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,799
radish sorghum sudan grass buckwheat and

63
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,280
there's also blends

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,479
so first off rye triticale and winter

65
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,840
wheat as we can see them kind of

66
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,159
pictured

67
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,759
right here so rye is very common in

68
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,878
colder climates it can germinate in

69
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,439
temperatures that are just above

70
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:14,719
freezing

71
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,120
does take a little time but it will

72
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,120
still germinate produces a fibrous root

73
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,800
system that can reduce soil erosion

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,599
and can really grow aggressively in the

75
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,920
early spring if conditions are favorable

76
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,039
although it may require some mowing it's

77
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,598
the quickest to mature

78
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,479
out of the comparison list provided here

79
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,560
triticale is

80
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,639
similar benefits to rye but does not

81
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,360
grow as aggressively as rye in the early

82
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,159
spring

83
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,519
making management of decal much easier a

84
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,840
lot of growers will provide triticale

85
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,159
over

86
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,000
rye simply there's less biomass to have

87
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,120
to deal with in the early spring

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
it also holds its feed value better cal

89
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
than rye

90
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,519
into late spring for grazing or making

91
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,878
it into hay or silage

92
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,280
this is why a lot of people will choose

93
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,159
triticale over just your common winter

94
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,680
rye

95
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,519
lastly there's winter wheat which is

96
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,319
common in southern plains region

97
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
best if used for grazing or for grain as

98
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,799
what its main purpose

99
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,679
is for now clover within clover there's

100
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,159
many options

101
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,719
so overall clover is a low growing and

102
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,719
can fix

103
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,120
nitrogen from the air but it should be

104
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,000
inoculated with rhizobacteria to allow

105
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,080
for maximum

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,360
effectiveness there's crimson clover

107
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,280
which is good for under

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,400
seating and easily killed by tilling or

109
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,598
low mowing

110
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,680
and then there's red clover which

111
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,959
performs best where corn does well it's

112
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,239
a good idea

113
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
lastly at the bottom here there's white

114
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,878
clover it can be invasive

115
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
as it can thrive uh survive being tilled

116
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,359
so

117
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
again invasive necessarily a bad thing

118
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,200
in the sense that it'll spread

119
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,318
everywhere

120
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,000
like a mint for example uh but does uh

121
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,679
keep that in mind this can survive some

122
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,759
tilling aspects

123
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,719
then there's mustard so mustard is a

124
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,079
biofumigant

125
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,680
for control of soil fungi and nematodes

126
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,080
kodiak mustard is known for its high

127
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,319
biomass about four to five tons per acre

128
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,519
and soil fumigation properties this is

129
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,119
kind of an example what that will look

130
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,120
like when it's in flower

131
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,719
growers should mow before plants set

132
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,878
seed and incorporate into the soil

133
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,120
immediately to have best effect

134
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,560
for soil pests and pretty much when it

135
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,319
flowers when you want to cut it down so

136
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,158
kind of the image right below me here

137
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,878
is that perfect time when to cut it mow

138
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,639
it and till it in with proper management

139
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,798
this crop may be used as an organic

140
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,840
replacement for chemical based fumigants

141
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,719
such as methyl bromide so at 18 pounds

142
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,918
to the acre

143
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,800
or an average of 180 000 seeds per pound

144
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:31,279
discriminated in very small seeds

145
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,199
then there is harry vetch harry vetch

146
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,879
fixes large amounts of nitrogen from the

147
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
air which can help meet nitrogen

148
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,800
needs of the following crops that's a

149
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,478
great advantage of hairy vetch

150
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,478
however we want you to keep in mind that

151
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,918
in the field

152
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,240
should be kept in the field i should say

153
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,439
and growing until the purple flowers

154
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,280
start to form which can take longer than

155
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,560
other crops so when the purple flowers

156
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,839
we see in the image here

157
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,759
this is the sign it's kind of reached

158
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,638
its maximum effectiveness

159
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,199
and it should be killed at this point

160
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,759
well with

161
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,000
mid-august planting peak nitrogen

162
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,280
concentration will typically not occur

163
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
until late may so as a result this

164
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:12,079
cover crop needs a long duration of time

165
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
longer than some other cover crops

166
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,758
making it not the best choice for some

167
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,919
growers however in addition

168
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,199
it does protect the soil from erosion in

169
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,918
addition to its nitrogen fixing

170
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,319
properties

171
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,079
can improve soil tillath and provides

172
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,038
weed control during the vigorous growth

173
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,279
in the spring

174
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,159
and when left as a dead mulch on the

175
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,758
soil surface

176
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,759
again there are some advantages using

177
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,600
hairy vetch hairy vetch can also be

178
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
grazed or harvested as forage

179
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,879
research has shown that hairy vetch

180
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,680
mulch can also

181
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,360
increase main crop disease resistant for

182
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,280
prolonged leaf photosynthesis

183
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,199
the following crop it's also been

184
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,599
utilized to help suppress fusarium

185
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,319
in some watermelon plantings keep in

186
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,960
mind though

187
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,639
if you do let it go to seed as a warning

188
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,478
the nice vines that you see here will

189
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,519
almost become like rope and can make

190
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,399
control of this

191
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,120
flavor crop very difficult and very

192
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,560
challenging

193
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,478
however you get it just at the time

194
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,478
pictured here it will

195
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,318
be able to be controlled very easily the

196
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,719
stems are relatively weak but it doesn't

197
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,120
take

198
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,800
long after those purple flowers start to

199
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,038
kind of mature and produce seeds

200
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720
that these nice little supple vines

201
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,360
initially will go right to basically

202
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
what looks like

203
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,680
rope there's also gaining popularity

204
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,159
something called tillage radish

205
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
so tillage radish can be used what's

206
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,360
called biotillofield

207
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,439
these plants produce large taproot as

208
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,038
you can see here and here

209
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,279
that can penetrate through compacted

210
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,399
layers and alleviate soil compaction

211
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,879
down eight inches

212
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,799
or sometimes even greater the radishes

213
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,478
decompose quickly in the spring leaving

214
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
large holes in the soil

215
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,079
however upon decomposition there can be

216
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,600
a foul odor

217
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,519
so watch planting densities and

218
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,919
proximity of your neighbors

219
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,159
when a broadcast use eight to ten pounds

220
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,079
per acre of tillage radish

221
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,919
they suggested to precision plant or

222
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,000
drill with eight to fifteen inch

223
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,279
row spacing as this will reduce the

224
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,279
seedling rates to half

225
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,359
the broadcast rate you'll be getting the

226
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,799
maximum amount of tillage biotillage i

227
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
should say effectiveness

228
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,680
from this particular radish then there's

229
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,639
sorghum sudan grass so sorghum sodium

230
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,120
grass

231
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,560
it's tall of course 5 to 12 feet tall

232
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,038
it's very fast growing

233
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,160
heat loving summer annual grass it's

234
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,240
very similar to growing

235
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,439
a corn plant simply it doesn't produce

236
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,439
an ear

237
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,439
it can smother weeds suppress some

238
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,240
nematode species and penetrate compacted

239
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,120
subsoil

240
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,800
if it is mowed once seed cost is modest

241
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,000
however growers need to be sure they

242
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
have the equipment to handle

243
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,439
the massive amount of biomass that's

244
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,879
produced here again it grows very

245
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,399
quickly you can get out of hand

246
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,159
so make sure if you are planting this

247
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,120
you do have the proper equipment to be

248
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,919
able to control it

249
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,038
when it does reach its peak biomass then

250
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,639
there is buckwheat

251
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,959
and you can see buckwheat in the images

252
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,160
right here it offers a lot of advantages

253
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,239
in the sense it's a fast

254
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,599
germinator and grower dense canopy

255
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,519
smothers annual weeds

256
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,199
protects the soil from erosion helps

257
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,120
conserve soil moisture

258
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,520
and attracts pollinators and beneficial

259
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,038
insects when buckwheat residues return

260
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,639
to the soil the phosphorus becomes

261
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,120
available for the next crop

262
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,879
if phosphorus is an issue in your area

263
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,319
plants are easy to control and should be

264
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,520
cut down shortly after flowering to

265
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
avoid reseeding

266
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,478
however even if it's seeds produces

267
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,918
seeds it's not usually a major issue

268
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,918
due to the benefits and ease of

269
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,120
controlling it should be applied at

270
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,038
about two pounds

271
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,399
per thousand square feet the seed is

272
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,318
also kind of unique in the sense it's

273
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,839
kind of like a pyramidal shape

274
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,879
and again growers get all concerned

275
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,758
about oh it's flying to killed

276
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,680
immediately

277
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,759
well to take advantage of some of those

278
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,240
pollinators you can let it produce seeds

279
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,519
i do have it come back but usually not

280
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,278
that aggressively

281
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,759
and if it does come back it usually can

282
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,918
be pretty easily controlled

283
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,838
then we get to cover crop blends so

284
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:44,799
often recommended or required in some

285
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,880
cases

286
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,879
the goals provide multiple benefits we

287
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,799
can see kind of that mix of seed here

288
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,159
however there tends to be a dominant

289
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,000
species or two

290
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,278
and others kind of get out competed so

291
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
keep in mind having a

292
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,759
cover cropland of 20 different species

293
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,399
may not end up with 20 species in the

294
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,480
end

295
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,399
some recommend 12 different species but

296
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,560
this can be a little excessive

297
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,559
typically blended three or so species is

298
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,239
advised to kind of target the particular

299
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,439
soil type or climate that you're dealing

300
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,240
with

301
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,160
some common blends uh are fifty percent

302
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,680
winter rye and forty percent winter oats

303
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,360
and ten percent hairy vetch

304
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,799
so that at a rate of seven to ten pounds

305
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,120
per thousand square feet

306
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,719
or 75 went to ride 25 percent hairy

307
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,440
vetch so at five pounds

308
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,360
uh per about 1250 square feet and

309
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
there's many many more options

310
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,639
however when you are looking at

311
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,079
spreading these we see the blends here

312
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,240
see a nice allocation of winter rye

313
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,600
and veg cover crop so here's your winter

314
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,600
rice seed here's your veg

315
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,120
there are different shapes the seeds are

316
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
different sizes so that may

317
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,679
impact how you're able to effectively

318
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,320
spread that over a field

319
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,719
now fertilizing your cover crop simply

320
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,959
is

321
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,399
not advised so a lot of people want a

322
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,278
really strong cover crop they want to

323
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,120
fertilize it

324
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,320
really it's not advised the cover crop

325
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,519
is can be a little

326
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,040
hungry can be a little nutrient

327
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,799
deficient that's fine you're just

328
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,480
looking at it establishing itself

329
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,838
to get some of those benefits and

330
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,320
maintain roots growing

331
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,079
in your particular field lastly is a

332
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
great resource to kind of look at

333
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,359
and also a free resource this would be

334
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,839
this kind of

335
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,480
managing cover crop profitability great

336
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,320
resource

337
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,720
it is free i'll give you a link to the

338
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,640
pdf here download it take a look at it

339
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,920
you can see some of the many inexpensive

340
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,000
options that exist

341
