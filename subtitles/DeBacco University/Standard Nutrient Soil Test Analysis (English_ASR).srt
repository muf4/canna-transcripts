00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,198
in this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,679
going to cover

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,878
standard nutrient soil test analysis

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,838
give you some idea what that will

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,080
actually show you

6
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,519
so you can be better informed and reason

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,920
why you should be taking

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,920
this soil test

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,159
[Music]

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,560
all right let's go over standard

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,399
nutrient soil test analysis

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,239
we'll start off with why would you soil

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,278
test well in short it's to know the

14
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,278
nutrient levels

15
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,840
to ensure optimum plant conditions can

16
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,200
be met in addition to fertilizers

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,360
knowing the soil's ph

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,399
can also help determine nutrient

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,640
availability

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,120
and if lime or sulfur applications are

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
needed to balance out that ph to make

22
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,359
those nutrients available

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,558
to the crop you're choosing to grow now

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,600
what can the test

25
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,119
determine so there's many things labs

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,920
might have slight variations but for the

27
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,320
most part

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,640
they tell you ph and they also give you

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,759
plant available phosphorus potassium

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
calcium magnesium micronutrients lead as

31
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,198
well as

32
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,959
aluminum all important things to know

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,478
some may go a little bit more and give

34
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,359
you a little bit more but at least they

35
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,679
should give you these

36
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,519
and these can give you a great start

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,479
micronutrients might vary from lab to

38
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,679
lab

39
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,679
so why is ph so important well ph is so

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,840
important because if you look at this

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,118
image here it has a great graphical

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,600
representation of how

43
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,640
soil ph affects availability of plant

44
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,478
nutrients

45
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,439
meaning if we're looking here at a ph of

46
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:34,000
7 we can see that those in green

47
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,359
are greatest available around that

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,519
particular ph

49
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,359
so in comparison we can see that

50
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,798
nitrogen phosphorus potassium sulfur

51
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,719
calcium magnesium

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,040
relatively plant available at a ph of

53
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,200
seven compared to iron which is

54
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
more available to plants at more of an

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,240
acidic ph

56
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,920
molybdenum just the opposite more

57
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,158
available to plants at more of a basic

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
ph so depending on what type of crop

59
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,600
you're growing

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,680
knowing the target ph level can affect

61
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,679
potentially what nutrients it may need

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,118
as an example blueberries tend to like a

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,719
more acidic environment

64
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,438
and they tend to like a little bit more

65
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,959
of those kind of iron as an example

66
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,799
more of the nutrients available at these

67
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,719
lower levels so again

68
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,400
great comparison here and you can see

69
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,439
how you get slightly off and how it can

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
really affect

71
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,840
the availability of certain nutrients to

72
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,560
your plants so this is why ph is very

73
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,239
important

74
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,239
and very important to know and make

75
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,920
modifications for

76
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,159
now remember soil test provides the

77
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,559
plant available nutrients

78
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,359
soil test does not provide the total

79
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,598
nutrients

80
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,120
however is an estimation of the plant

81
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,959
available nutrients

82
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
if a plant cannot use the nutrient then

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,200
they're not included in the soil

84
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,598
analysis

85
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,518
at least theoretically this is why if

86
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,719
people take the same soil sample and

87
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,319
they like divide it up

88
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,000
into two subsamples and they send it off

89
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,359
to different labs they're going to put

90
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,280
one lab against another

91
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,400
who gives them the most accurate results

92
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,759
and they get the results back and

93
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,840
they're slightly different

94
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,039
well this is because each lab is doing

95
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,039
the best it can

96
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,799
to estimate the plant available

97
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,598
nutrients and there might be slightly

98
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,439
difference

99
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,719
in the numbers but for the most part

100
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,280
they're going to be very close to one

101
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,680
another

102
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,039
because it's not the total amount of

103
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,560
phosphorus you have in your soil

104
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,000
not the total amount of potassium you

105
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,039
have in your soil it's an estimate of

106
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,959
what's available

107
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,878
to your plants we can see here our ph

108
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,519
will impact that

109
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,318
now what are the limitations to soil

110
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,640
testing and

111
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,639
soil test is not the same as a soil

112
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,919
diagnostic test that tests for disease

113
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,598
so keep that in mind

114
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,839
soil tests can also not determine

115
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,000
drainage issues environmental stresses

116
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
as well as insect problems so they're

117
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,799
great at telling you what nutrients

118
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,919
might be available to your plants

119
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,920
but that's their limitation

120
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,280
so growers often wonder what's the best

121
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,640
time of year to go through and take

122
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,640
their soil sample

123
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,079
well really any time the soil is not

124
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,759
frozen is a good time

125
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,360
april and may have the highest volume

126
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,878
months so this will likely slow the

127
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,360
response time of your results

128
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,479
and typically navigate fall is optimum

129
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,319
especially from lime is

130
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,399
thought to be needed so it can take a

131
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:06,318
long time for that lime to activate

132
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,438
this can also allow you to prepare

133
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:08,958
nutrients ahead of time if you're

134
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,639
sampling in the fall

135
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,479
so you're ready to go by the time others

136
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,318
are thinking it's springtime

137
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,478
and then things get very busy and very

138
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,120
limited so false sampling is advised but

139
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
really

140
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,280
there's no best time of year anytime the

141
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,439
soil is not frozen

142
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,799
now how to test the soil well when

143
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,759
you're going about you want to search

144
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,160
out a local lab

145
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,160
and download their instructions and very

146
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,240
importantly their required paperwork

147
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,919
be sure to read this and follow the

148
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,680
instructions i also have another video

149
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:36,478
on how to properly take a soil sample as

150
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
a good guide

151
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,519
but make sure you're also getting the

152
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,719
right paperwork for the lab that you'll

153
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,719
be testing

154
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,160
fill it all fill it all out write it

155
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,600
neatly mail it off with

156
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,600
any payment that's required with the

157
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,439
soil sample and you'll hopefully get

158
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,240
results back as quick as the lab can

159
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,279
process them

160
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,918
so you can go through and make

161
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:56,959
adjustments if you need to to maximize

162
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,959
your plant yield
