00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,359
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:09,759
where i'll be investigating the 2020

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:12,480
cbd ncbg cultivar trial data summary

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,279
from cornell hemp so these provide some

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,359
great data

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,960
and i'm going to go through here share

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,278
it with you and break it down a little

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,199
bit so you can better understand it

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,118
so first off looking at the cbd

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,519
cultivars well they chose a

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,198
large sample set we're looking at 41

12
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,439
cultivars used in the study

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,400
as can be seen in this list here so a

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,719
lot of people always learn

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,558
like well what cbd cultivars are there

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
this can be a good starting

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,640
point now there's additional information

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,920
more than just a list of cultivars

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,320
you can also look and see the

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,559
propagation whether it was from seed

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,000
and where that seed was dioecious

22
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:50,078
meaning expecting 50 male and 50 female

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,198
or whether that seed was feminized where

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,520
we'd expect it

25
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,558
above that you know ideally above 90

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,160
percent

27
00:00:54,558 --> 00:01:01,280
um 95 female now if it was

28
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,038
from seed versus a clone the germination

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,079
rate is provided so for germination rate

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,439
we could see some a very high

31
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,519
germination rate

32
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,199
some much lower here this one here

33
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,399
looking at only 70

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,320
so a good time to kind of go through

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
pause and take a look pause the video

36
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,359
take a look at some of the cultivars the

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,920
propagation the sources

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,359
and then the sites that they were grown

39
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,239
this just again gives you some more

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,560
information

41
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,599
to make a wise decision when selecting a

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,640
cultivar

43
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,118
so while these are 41 cb cultivars

44
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,640
we also have a list here of cbg

45
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,719
cultivars and a lot of growers are kind

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,439
of interested in this cannabinoid

47
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,118
and then are curious were where what are

48
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,719
some cultivars that fit in this category

49
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,400
what are some of the propagation

50
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,759
material you're going to get clones can

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,359
i get seeds

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,118
and where's the source for there and we

53
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,719
can see them all listed out here

54
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,478
so this can again provide a good

55
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,399
starting point but addition want to see

56
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,319
how these cultivars perform

57
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,079
and this study specifically was looking

58
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,519
at the flower timing

59
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,199
so that's going to be the main focus

60
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,798
here is looking at the timing of

61
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,320
flour for these different cultivars so

62
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,880
23 of the 52 cultivars in the 2020 cbd

63
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,839
cbg

64
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,959
trial have initiated terminal flowering

65
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,400
before

66
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:16,319
8 17 20. that is august

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,599
17th the year 2020. each dot in this

68
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,679
uh here on this graph here indicates

69
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,199
the date an individual plant was marked

70
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,879
as terminal flowering

71
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,479
violent outlines show the distribution

72
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,079
of points for each cultivar

73
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,519
percents indicate the percent of

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,040
cultivated flower

75
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,800
uh by 8 1720 by august 17th 2020. we can

76
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,959
see that listed right here

77
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,239
meaning some were literally a hundred

78
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,598
percent into flower

79
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,319
by this date some only 25 percent into

80
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,560
flower

81
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,000
so this is an important consideration

82
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,680
when we're looking at kind of outdoor

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,159
growing that timing of that

84
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,599
flowering there and how necessarily

85
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,598
that's it's not always are all going to

86
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,119
flower at the same time

87
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,280
different cultivar is going to flower at

88
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,959
different times and this can impact

89
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,878
when someone may choose to plant them

90
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,680
this can impact when we're looking at

91
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,679
harvesting want to maximize that plant

92
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
try to minimize the investment and

93
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,200
maximize the return

94
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
so again this is just good information

95
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,079
here again rather than highlight each

96
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,079
individual cultivar

97
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,560
go through pause the video take a look

98
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,719
at it and this is some great information

99
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,878
for to growers when you're looking at

100
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,239
making that selection of cultivar and

101
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,479
also maybe here

102
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,158
knowing what cultivars might exist that

103
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,639
you may have not been initially familiar

104
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,639
with
