1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
in this debacco University video I'm

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:05,640
going to go over the impact of organic

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,599
and mineral-based fertilizers in

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,599
relation to cannabis

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,118
[Music]

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,480
yield all right so I know there's some

7
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:19,160
great debate between organic and mineral

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,920
based fertilizers so let's take a look

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,759
at it from a scientific Viewpoint first

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
off here is the research article if you

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,039
want to to dive into the information a

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,519
little more detail I provide the proper

13
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,920
uh citation right here I'll give you my

14
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,920
take on it so first off there were two

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,960
liquid fertilizer types there was the um

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,320
organic and the Mineral Solution both

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,920
were prepared in order to contain the

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,640
same concentration of macronutrients

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,879
based on manufacturer provided

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,198
information macronutrients are nitrogen

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,039
phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium

22
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:53,799
were the main focus of the study no

23
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,160
signs or symptoms of micronutrient

24
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,358
deficiencies or toxicities were observed

25
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,038
between the organic and mineral

26
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,879
treatments you want to know all the

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,118
details of the f concentrations the PHS

28
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:06,359
the ECS the um Solutions and the

29
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,920
compositions and ratios of the

30
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,519
fertilizer Solutions it's all provided

31
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,359
here for you to take a look at but again

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,679
take a message in order to provide the

33
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,438
same same concentration of

34
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,159
macronutrients despite being organic or

35
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,039
mineral so fertili concentrations and

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,400
the general sequence so the

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,320
concentrations were 80 uh milligram per

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,040
liter 160 Mig per liter and 240

39
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,199
fertilizer treatments were applied in in

40
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,240
liquid solution uh twice per week

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,240
starting at day 22 um and you can see

42
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:40,399
table two which is located right here um

43
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,399
for more details it's days after

44
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,000
planting plants did not receive any

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,280
further fertilization during the last

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,519
week of cultivation and we can kind of

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,000
see the um days here the cultivation

48
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,560
week the fertilizer solution the

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,200
accumulative solution amounts and then

50
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,280
the concentrations at 80 160 and 240 so

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,079
all broken down right there for you now

52
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,000
plant sampling what was done here in

53
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,239
this study was at two Harvesters during

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,479
the stage at 22 and Day 36 days after

55
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:14,239
planting four Harvest during the

56
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,800
flowering stage at days 54 69 83 and 99

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,599
at each Harvest four plants per

58
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,000
treatment one plant per treatment and a

59
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:22,959
replicant um were cut at the base and

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,280
separated into three fa uh factorial

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,439
sections stems leaves and in

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,598
fluorescence there so this is kind of

63
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,400
the breakdown of basically how the study

64
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,479
was was

65
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,920
conducted uh when we're looking at plant

66
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:38,280
comparisons at Day 36 and day 99 how did

67
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:41,280
they actually look so here's our

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,039
fertilizer um concentration for organic

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,640
on the top row and mineral on the bottom

70
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:50,158
row here we're looking at Day 36 and

71
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,598
then day 99 which is the Harvest just so

72
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:54,280
you can see some visual uh comparisons

73
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:55,719
there so it's the end of the Ved stage

74
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,239
and this is basically the Harvest there

75
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:59,759
so you can do some visual comparisons if

76
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,920
you want between those now looking at

77
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,199
the the flower comparisons um we're

78
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,280
looking at day 99 of harvest plants were

79
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,679
defoliated to show only the infloresence

80
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,680
just before flower and we can see that

81
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,760
located uh in the image right here we're

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,040
looking at the source of variation we're

83
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,759
looking at the concentration of nitrogen

84
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,840
phosphorus pottassium

85
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,120
um uh looking at those different

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,719
contents there we could see just kind of

87
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,319
how we're looking at breaking those down

88
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,878
here from a kind of table standpoint but

89
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,199
also from a visual standpoint let's get

90
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,959
into some more what the what this

91
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,759
research actually did show so looking at

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
the vegetative plant growth well it was

93
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,438
not affected by the type of fertilizer

94
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,559
as indicated by similar values of leaf

95
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:43,799
area and specific Leaf area so looking

96
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,598
at kind of our data table right over

97
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,080
here when you see um NS basically no

98
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:51,158
significant uh difference there plant

99
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,079
dry matter which is a increase steadily

100
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:54,798
over time for both fertilizer types

101
00:03:53,079 --> 00:04:00,280
marginal differences shown between day

102
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,799
22 and day 66 we can kind of see that 69

103
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm sorry we can see that from here um

104
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,879
to basically day 69 right here again

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,280
plant dry matter we're seeing very

106
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:11,560
marginal differences but not really

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,759
anything too significant we're going to

108
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,439
get to be uh okay down here for um Leaf

109
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,798
area per plant the interaction of

110
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:22,478
fertilizer type and days after planting

111
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,159
was not significant fertilizer type was

112
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,039
significant with larger Leaf area for

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,800
the mineral treatments compared to the

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,360
organic treatments Again by a slight

115
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,280
margin here when you see those different

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,160
letters

117
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,319
and organic is the green bars and

118
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,439
mineral is the um black and white bars

119
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,399
there's no significant difference

120
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,079
between fertilizer types were found for

121
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,679
a specific Leaf area and that's looking

122
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,680
again at uh letter C here decreasing

123
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,560
trend from day 69 days after planting to

124
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,120
range between uh 282.30

125
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,759
cm squared uh per gram there now the

126
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,240
least squared means and all the little

127
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,240
information here about what's you're

128
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,478
seeing in these graphs is provided right

129
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,560
here just to give you a little bit of

130
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:03,839
anide idea but we're looking at that

131
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,839
kind of veget to flowering is flipping

132
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,879
between Day 36 and day 54 and we can see

133
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,799
differences in Trends located here

134
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,879
during the vegetative part what the

135
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,960
plants actually look like well this is a

136
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,159
kind of a late harvest leaf sample day

137
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,198
99 leaves from the different canopy

138
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,800
positions it Illustrated for the factors

139
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,319
fertilizer type which is vertical and

140
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,439
then fertilizer concentration which is

141
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,160
horizontal so this is the low end of the

142
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,079
fertilizer the 80 the 160 and the 240

143
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,600
and we see organic in the top row and

144
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,959
mineral here in the bottom row note that

145
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,080
there was some tip ear at the high

146
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,439
higher fertilizer concentrations uh so

147
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,038
just keep note of that that there are

148
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:44,399
some toxicity Sy uh symptoms as well

149
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:46,159
looking at the yield difference so final

150
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,799
yield differences a was mainly

151
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,680
attributed to at least 2 weeks before

152
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Harvest when the mineral fation had

153
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,478
significantly higher INF fluoresence dry

154
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,240
matter than organic treatments CBD yield

155
00:05:55,478 --> 00:06:00,240
um differences between fertilizer types

156
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,360
was lower due to lower CBD concentration

157
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,800
with mineral F fertilization indicating

158
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,598
a possible dilution effect during the

159
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,720
last 2 weeks before Harvest influenced

160
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,879
dry matter strongly increased and Canam

161
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,599
were accumulated for part C here

162
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,719
presenting a large sink with high

163
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:18,800
simulate nutrient demand there again we

164
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,800
see the same coloration difference

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,280
between organic and our mineral NS

166
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,840
referring to no significant difference

167
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,598
there now nitrogen forms we need to keep

168
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,318
in mind that one main difference among

169
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:31,639
nitrogen forms and fertilizer types is

170
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,520
that organic fertilizers contain higher

171
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,918
ratios of the ammonia and the nitrates

172
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:39,120
than mineral fertilizers so when we're

173
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:41,719
looking at our comparison you know the

174
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,199
type of nitrogen plays a role those

175
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,039
ammoniums and those um nitrates versus

176
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,680
those nitrites is going to be very

177
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,839
different and how those potentially can

178
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,360
be absorbed by the plant and what the

179
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:54,719
odds are of them leeching or

180
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,960
denitrifying there uh so just keep that

181
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,599
in mind that the organic fertilizing the

182
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,439
inheritage of the ammonium and the NO3

183
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,598
the nitrate

184
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,759
concentrations now NPK levels uh in the

185
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,439
leaves compared to flowers so kind of an

186
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,560
interesting kind of correlation here

187
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:12,639
blue representing the lower green the

188
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,959
mid and red the higher fertilization

189
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,519
rates nitrogen is easily Mobile in the

190
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,198
plant tissue which can be observed by

191
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,519
the presence of Curves of accumulation

192
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,960
depletion within nitrogen levels

193
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,758
phosphorus is also a mobile um nutrient

194
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,359
here we can see that right here but

195
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,680
movement in the leaves to flowers was

196
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,720
not clearly as visible as it was for

197
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,478
nitrogen all treatments reached a

198
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,520
plateau for phosphorus around day

199
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:41,439
69 uh at the final Harvest uh plants of

200
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:43,519
the 8060 and 240 accumulated 41.9 49.7

201
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,800
and 59 milligrams of phosphorus per

202
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,478
plant in the leaves respectively uh

203
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,960
phosphorus content in infloresence was

204
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:52,399
up 4.2 times higher than the leaves so

205
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,000
the flowers compared to the leaves where

206
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,560
that's accumulating is a definitely an

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,158
interesting Factor there again this is

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,360
looking at the leaf column and then the

209
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:03,519
flowers the of potassium was similar to

210
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,598
phosphorus Only Exception plants for the

211
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,318
lowest fertilizer concentration 80

212
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,959
reached their Plateau earlier um at day

213
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,960
69 so again little nice comparison here

214
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,279
between what's happening in the leaves

215
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,038
compared to what's happening in the

216
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,239
flowers now when we're looking at

217
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,038
phosphorus fertilization um in this

218
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,478
study no significant differences between

219
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,000
fertilizer concentrations were found for

220
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:27,839
phosphorus concentrations in the

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,598
infloresence at the final Harvest PE

222
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,038
concentration in leaves stems and sub

223
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,360
rate were significantly higher for the

224
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,399
highest treatment uh indicating overall

225
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,519
fertilization with phosphorus at the

226
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,240
flowering stage maintaining High

227
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,240
nutrient levels in leaves and substrates

228
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,479
is not relevant at the Harvest point so

229
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,720
this is important for consideration uh

230
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,959
that we really want to be mindful of how

231
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,120
much fertilizer we're adding uh because

232
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,399
it could lead to negative effects or

233
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,799
really just increased cost with no

234
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,120
increased benefit in the end

235
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,319
product now mineral fertilization

236
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,159
generally um has shows higher nutrient

237
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,440
uptake and ergonomic uses efficiencies

238
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:05,480
compared to organic treatments mainly

239
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
because it's immediately available and

240
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,519
it's not really needs to be broken down

241
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,360
um by anything so keep this in mind that

242
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,919
this is an important consideration when

243
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,320
we're comparing these fertilizer types

244
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,759
those organic fertilizers um signally

245
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,480
lower PL infloresence dry matter Leaf

246
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,399
area and finally CBD yield of organic

247
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,839
treatments are supported by the general

248
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,480
lower nitrogen uptake efficiency

249
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,160
especially in the last 2 weeks which is

250
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,879
a major sink stage where that nutrients

251
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,838
are potentially going into that flour

252
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,120
compared to those mineral treatments so

253
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,920
it did kind of Wan or did kind of

254
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,360
struggle those last two weeks there now

255
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,719
if using organic fertilizers uh you

256
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,399
should uh you should be applied earlier

257
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,278
and potentially at higher rates than

258
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,679
mineral components to be available

259
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,320
during those final two weeks of

260
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,679
flowering when the sink demand for

261
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,640
infloresence is very high try to meet

262
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,559
those demands and because minerals are

263
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,919
available so quickly they can meet those

264
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,879
demands and the plant can uptake it

265
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,439
right away because they're need a little

266
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,559
breakdown time to be absorbed by the

267
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,920
plant um applying a little bit more

268
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,879
especially paying attention those final

269
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:10,679
two weeks right before Harvest could be

270
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,000
important to maintain quality yield Now

271
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,159
The Best of Both Worlds you know a

272
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,078
higher availability of mineral

273
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:17,240
fertilizers can be important for plant

274
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,919
initial growth while organic fertilizers

275
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,799
can be employed as a more suitable

276
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,919
sustainable nutrient complement during

277
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,479
the flowering stage without major yield

278
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,360
losses it's kind of playing to the

279
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,879
strengths of both using mineral

280
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,919
fertilizers for that quick kind of

281
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,399
available and using organic fertilizers

282
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,599
for that longer more sustained growth

283
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,799
off for the

284
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,800
plant now take home message here we're

285
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,278
looking at fertilizer concentration the

286
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:44,759
fertilizer concentration of 160 uh

287
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,919
produced 95% of the CBD yield compared

288
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,600
to the highest rate which is 240 while

289
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:53,039
receiving oneir less nutrients so if you

290
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,680
can get 95% of the yield with a third

291
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,120
less nutrients um that can really help

292
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,838
the profitability standpoint that can

293
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,200
really help you know Max maximizing

294
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,680
yields by minimizing

295
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,639
inputs now organic fertilizer usage if

296
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,519
you're going to be using this Source um

297
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,159
you may have to add more than someone

298
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,600
else using mineral based fertilizers

299
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,240
because of the lower nutrient uptake

300
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,278
efficiency so we had to keep that in

301
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,879
mind and the nutrient acquisition was

302
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,000
lower for organic fertilizer during the

303
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,919
final two weeks before Harvest resulting

304
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,958
in reduced biomass and CBD yield

305
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,719
compared to Mineral fertilizer

306
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,599
treatments now we're looking at

307
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,320
phosphorus fertilizer here nothing

308
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,680
against any of these but be mindful of

309
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,440
the amount of phosphorus that you're

310
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,199
adding uh the fertilizer rate for

311
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,360
phosphorus can be generally reduced

312
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,160
during the end of flowering to avoid

313
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,360
unproductive nutrient accumulation in

314
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,679
the vegetative plant organs so that's

315
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,000
especially mindful if you're using these

316
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:49,000
very high Bloom based fertilizers that

317
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,120
have 50 55 45% phosphorus plants don't

318
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,440
need as much phosphorus as many Growers

319
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,320
have been led to believe and this study

320
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,800
continues to prove that showing that it

321
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,040
doesn't really help the flowers at all

322
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,000
does accumulate in the stems and the

323
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:01,439
leaves but those typically are plant

324
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,519
parts that Growers are not really

325
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,639
looking at harvesting or receiving any

326
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,679
benefit from so cut down on your

327
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,399
phosphorous fertilizer you can help

328
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,000
reduce your chance at environmental

329
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:16,120
contamination reduce your cost and still

330
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,120
maintain the same yields
