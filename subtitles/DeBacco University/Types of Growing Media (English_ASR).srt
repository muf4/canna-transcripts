1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
okay so here might investigate three

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,439
major types of growing media as often I

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,240
get asked well you know which one's the

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,160
best and there's no direct answer to

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,138
which one's the best but so a lot of

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,570
people that use kind of three main types

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,099
or you may have your own but it's kind

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,550
of the three main staples that I see

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,859
very commonly I used our one is Pro mix

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,589
this could be considered a standard mix

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,630
for many growers and certain grow shops

12
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:30,089
they'll have bales of this all stacked

13
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:32,368
on one another it's a versatile mix that

14
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,079
serves not only as a good standalone

15
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,780
product but it can provide a quality

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,850
base to tweak for individual needs it

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,850
does contain it does have peat moss as

18
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,950
its higher percentage which is typically

19
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,620
65 to 75 percent of the total product

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,530
here you can see here this is pro mix BX

21
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,659
with mycorrhizae and general purpose

22
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,670
they make a lot of different sub recipes

23
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,549
there this is kind of one of the

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,309
standards just to consider is it even

25
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,530
the base material it's also metro mix or

26
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,119
Sun grow there's many different blends

27
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,219
for this some consider it to be

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,629
confusing because of all the options so

29
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:08,280
it's important if you do find once you

30
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:09,899
like to get the tag and to know exactly

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,269
what you get so that you're able to go

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,909
through and repeat that send girl

33
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,618
horticultural Kevin now owns many other

34
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,000
brands so this is something else that's

35
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,469
happening in the marketplace where one

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,709
brand is going through and buying up

37
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:25,170
other names that you might be familiar

38
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:27,750
with so so for example if I've heard

39
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,810
sunshine advanced black gold and Metro

40
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,930
mix are now all owned under Sun Grill

41
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,549
horticulture of Canada the last one here

42
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,320
is happy frog growers like this company

43
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,150
for not only the current media substrate

44
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,188
but also the nutrient charge' is

45
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,600
typically added I can also be

46
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,269
pre-inoculated with beneficial soil

47
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,408
microbes as we see listed here in proper

48
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:51,569
gills program for the mycorrhizae and

49
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:53,399
the fungus and then for bacteria b c and

50
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,099
c fu colony forming units per gram

51
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,780
listed here this can make a ready to use

52
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,658
product directly out of the bag and this

53
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,000
is why some growers prefer this to use

54
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,880
as part of their graph so those are just

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,859
three examples there experiment find

56
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,530
something you like and work with it is

57
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:12,568
there a perfect growing mix no find ones

58
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,009
you can work with and one that you can

59
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:17,158
modify

60
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,449
and maybe use a base material and they

61
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:20,548
all have their own little quirks and

62
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:21,839
keep in mind watch the labels to make

63
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:24,420
sure that the manufacturer doesn't

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,378
change what's inside the bag even if

65
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,378
they call by the same name
