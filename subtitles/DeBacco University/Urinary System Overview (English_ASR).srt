1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,219
okay he wrote me going over a brief

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:07,019
overview of the urinary system and how

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:09,839
it plays an important role in our bodies

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,910
so the first off there's five main

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,468
functions of the urinary system first

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,079
one is to regulate blood volume and

7
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:18,358
blood pressure it does this by adjusting

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,358
the volume of water lost in urine and

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,300
also by releasing renin and every throw

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,449
PO and these are two ways that our body

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,539
can help regulate our volume of blood

12
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,859
but also our pressure this is kind of a

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,579
little bit of that kind of complex

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,170
system here with runnin here and

15
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:41,210
angiotensin and release of hormones that

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,739
can cause different changes in our body

17
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,960
now looking specifically at the runnin

18
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,669
and angiotensin system

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,620
renin is an enzyme that's released by

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,079
the kidneys so part of the urinary

21
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,579
system in response to a drop in blood

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,980
pressure which increases the

23
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,710
reabsorption of water so that's one way

24
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:01,169
want to be able to reabsorb water in our

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,539
nephrons Brennan also catalyzes a

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,820
production of angiotensin which is a

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,519
hormone that causes arterioles to

28
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:09,599
constrict raising blood pressure so

29
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,089
think about it this way this is our

30
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,339
normal blood vessel by constricting

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,368
through vasoconstriction closing that

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,770
down we're causing an increase in our

33
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:23,040
pressure this will also cause water

34
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,929
retention to occur so think about both

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,240
of these systems and how they work to

36
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,118
help the body maintain homeostasis of

37
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,039
blood pressure that gets too low what's

38
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,170
something that the body could do if it

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,630
gets too high it's something in contrast

40
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,189
to what we saw before with where we can

41
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,390
kind of reduce our blood pressure

42
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:43,078
because we want to maintain that

43
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,868
homeostasis looking at the conversion of

44
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,339
angiotensin one angiotensin 2 if you

45
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:48,478
have a complex process here I'm just

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,509
going to cover it in the very brief

47
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,578
sense we have enzyme our reaction the

48
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,129
liver releasing the angiotensin into the

49
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:59,039
blood kidneys also releasing the enzyme

50
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:01,859
renin into the blood this will cascade

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,850
into angiotensin 1 through enzymatic

52
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:08,098
reactions it's converted with the ACA

53
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:09,419
the indention converting enzyme in the

54
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,289
pulmonary blood

55
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,530
this is causing angiotensin 2 so in the

56
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,090
back

57
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,159
reaction is causing that conversion in

58
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,349
your attention to this is gonna

59
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,329
stimulate widespread vasoconstriction

60
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:23,609
when arterial are going to constrict or

61
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,569
get smaller they're gonna stimulate the

62
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:30,270
adrenal cortex to secrete ll2 durst Oh

63
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:34,679
which is ultimately going to cause the

64
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:37,080
kidneys to start to retain more water so

65
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,300
it's delaying sodium up taking the

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,370
integral cell membrane and the distal

67
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,950
convoluted tubule you collecting ducts

68
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,030
they haven't looked at the nephron video

69
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:47,969
you're welcome to take a look at that

70
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,469
and ADH is causing aquaporins to move to

71
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:51,659
the collecting ducts and plasma membrane

72
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:54,359
which is increasing water reabsorption

73
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,979
so all this is kind of occurring uses

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,180
helping the body regulate blood volume

75
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:01,979
and also pressure where were thrown is

76
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,439
another one mentioned this is a second

77
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,539
response to low blood pressure and this

78
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,769
is a hormone reserve apparently travels

79
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,409
to the bone marrow and stimulus the

80
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,080
production of new blood cells so how

81
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,159
does this help maintain homeostasis

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,590
under the way to think about it is we're

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,400
looking at our blood system for a low in

84
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,959
blood volume

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,610
what's are we working to increase that

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,009
we know it's made in the bone marrow

87
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,110
however it was our potent will the the

88
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:27,179
actual hormone to stimulate the

89
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,299
production increase the number of red

90
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,069
blood cells another function here in a

91
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,230
system is to regulate plasma ion

92
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,909
concentrations and this does occur in

93
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,859
the kidneys is how much is it going to

94
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:40,829
absorb Rather's will released into the

95
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,230
urine so this is part of that urinary

96
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:47,700
system to maintain that balance between

97
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:49,619
our plasma ion concentrations another

98
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,750
function is helps stabilize blood pH

99
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,909
this controls the loss of hydrogen ions

100
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,289
and bicarbonate ions in the urine or

101
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,479
thought it can help get rid of more of

102
00:03:55,289 --> 00:04:00,209
one or the other to keep that pH and

103
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,979
evam you take range if the blows rate

104
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:06,019
regulates it stays within a range of

105
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:14,429
7.35 to 7.45 approximately here we see

106
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:16,680
7.35 to 7.45 and eight now that's a

107
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,680
large swing we're looking at into the

108
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,598
hundreds place of ph measuring how it

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,519
goes about doing that we have our

110
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:25,829
equation here carbon dioxide in our

111
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,620
water and our carbonic acid

112
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:30,719
ion's bicarbonate ions the ratio we have

113
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,189
of these will determine the pH everybody

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,020
can go back and forth with this to help

115
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:37,349
regulate that to maintain the proper

116
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:39,779
homeostasis in addition the urinary

117
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:43,620
system help conserve al nutrients it can

118
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:46,109
prevent excretion of waste products if

119
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,009
there is a deficiency or it can increase

120
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,080
excretion

121
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:51,389
there's determined to be an excess of

122
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,709
nutrients again a way that we wanted to

123
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,960
say in this kind of green optimal

124
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,269
nutrition that homeostasis we need to

125
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,189
reduce things if it gets too high but

126
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:03,658
also bring them up if it does get too

127
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:05,389
low lastly we're looking at the urinary

128
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:07,860
system will assist the liver to detoxify

129
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,379
poisons particularly amino acid

130
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,360
metabolism so there's call this things

131
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:15,120
called liver detox there's detoxing

132
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,520
recipes people go in a very simple diet

133
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,050
I'd help detoxify poisons but really

134
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,049
it's a yearning system on a continual

135
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,900
basis particularly the amino acid

136
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,810
metabolism is what the earing system

137
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:30,149
needs to do to help out the liver the

138
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,199
amino acid metabolism moving our amino

139
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:33,329
acids our building blocks of our

140
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,158
proteins that need for villain protein

141
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:37,589
can be metabolized for energy or broken

142
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:40,288
part and covered carbon chain is used to

143
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:42,508
make fat within our amino acids we have

144
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:45,149
this variant our group our voxel group a

145
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,830
hydrogen in our amino group this can be

146
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:49,459
broken apart by taking the nitrogen and

147
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:53,658
that can accumulate and that can be of

148
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:56,278
toxic levels potentially within the body

149
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:58,139
looking at nitrogen in particular if

150
00:05:56,278 --> 00:06:00,689
ammonia generate that's it's toxic and

151
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,300
highly water soluble one our body to be

152
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:04,680
able to break that down and convert it

153
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,009
in the liver is where this occurs

154
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,129
converting this toxic ammonia into urea

155
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:12,598
which is less toxic and less

156
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:15,028
water-soluble both of these believe that

157
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:18,269
fertilizers that we see applied here see

158
00:06:15,028 --> 00:06:20,218
a strong nitrogen component in hydrous

159
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:22,649
ammonia is one thing that's applied in a

160
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:25,560
large part across the country in urea is

161
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,638
also a form of a nitrogen fertilizer so

162
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,870
the body wants to go through this

163
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,028
process when it breaks down of amino

164
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,319
acids it will generate ammonia wants to

165
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:33,120
go through the additional process with

166
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,669
the assistance of the liver to convert

167
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,800
that to urea and it will be then carried

168
