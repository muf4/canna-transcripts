1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:06,200
okay the topic of this video is

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,730
transport proteins looking here at our

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,980
phospholipid bilayer see several

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,980
proteins embedded now much remember

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,800
going looking back diffusion can occur

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,750
without any proteins however here we're

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,199
looking at transport proteins so in

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,809
these examples were looking at

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,310
substances that may need a protein to be

10
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:28,469
able to move them across the

11
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,149
phospholipid bilayer now this can be

12
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,858
because of their size because they're

13
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,409
charged for many different reasons but

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,390
simply they need a protein now needing a

15
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:39,299
protein does not automatically mean it

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,909
means energy passive transport can occur

17
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:44,250
with channel proteins and carrier meat

18
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:48,359
mediated proteins however not all

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,759
carrier proteins are part of the passive

20
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,738
transport some do require energy and we

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,558
call those active transport let's look

22
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,849
at some of those on more detail so

23
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:59,820
starting first with active transport

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,100
this requires energy from ATP remember

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,349
adenosine triphosphate to move

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,170
substances against the concentration

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,329
gradient what this an example this is up

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,189
the concentration gradient so what this

29
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:14,280
looks like here is if we look at our

30
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:16,709
membrane and we have a high ion

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,200
concentration here and a low ion

32
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,449
concentration up here typically the

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,759
process of regular diffusion just

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,070
passive transfer of materials occurred

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,700
these materials would diffuse across the

36
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:28,469
membrane

37
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,269
however because we're looking at active

38
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:34,500
transport this is where we're using

39
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,938
energy ATP to pull these ions even

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,828
though there's a low concentration of

41
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:39,688
them pull them across the membrane to

42
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:42,118
force them over here even though they

43
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:43,859
don't want to be so it's kind of like

44
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,578
you not wanting to go to class and being

45
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:49,379
out in the hall after passing time and

46
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:50,938
someone has to come grab you and bring

47
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:54,239
you into class just all your fellow

48
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:55,828
students so that's an example of active

49
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,539
transport moving against a concentration

50
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:00,298
gradient or there's a low amount of

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,340
concentration and being pulled across to

52
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,840
this area of higher concentration this

53
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,259
can be advantageous to the cell if they

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,759
need this particular ion again after

55
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,860
transport requires use of carrier

56
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,669
proteins there's two types there's can

57
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,310
be a membrane pump or a couple

58
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:17,229
spork so membrane pumping can see the

59
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,729
word pump think of a normal pump could

60
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:21,039
be a water pump requiring electricity

61
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,318
requiring energy to be petroleum

62
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,870
products the key part here is requiring

63
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:29,739
energy and couple transport when I talk

64
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,150
about our code transport systems here so

65
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,790
again our active transport requiring

66
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,189
energy ion pumps they could move these

67
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:40,479
are sodium ions potassium ions calcium

68
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:44,430
ions magnesium ions potassium and sodium

69
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:47,889
exchange pump is a very common pump

70
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:51,069
these proton pumps are moving hydrogen

71
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:52,689
ions as we see here uses photosynthesis

72
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:54,639
or food energy to create a photon

73
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:57,009
concentration I'm sorry a proton

74
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,589
concentration gradient that then is used

75
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:01,929
to manufacture ATP this is higher

76
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,560
hydrogen ion concentration is higher

77
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:09,430
proton concentration is what's being

78
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,430
generated here in force through ATP

79
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,430
synthase here to generate ATP so in

80
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,659
order to generate ATP we need our

81
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,370
protons don't want to have a higher

82
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,759
concentration in this external

83
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:24,250
environment in this internal memory

84
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,979
moving them across and forcing them over

85
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:30,219
in this case is allowing them us to

86
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:32,798
harvest the energy in this case we see

87
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:34,329
this example here and we see a lot of

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,489
folds remember our surface area to

89
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:38,590
volume ratio a lot of folds here

90
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,140
indicate this could be what a

91
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:45,310
mitochondria does the mitochondria is

92
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:48,729
forcing concentration of gradients and

93
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,890
then harnessing that energy through its

94
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:54,939
particular protein passing only through

95
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:58,809
one way and as a result taking ADP and a

96
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,879
free phosphorus deterrent ATP so proton

97
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,409
pump moving hydrogen ions and

98
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,299
photosynthesis want to go over that

99
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,489
we'll see that in more detail or food

100
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:08,590
energy create this proton concentration

101
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,170
gradient that then is used to

102
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,930
manufacture ATP because there's a lot of

103
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:15,759
protons here they want to diffuse across

104
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,069
we the cell and that lets them go

105
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,219
through in one area and as ATP is

106
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:23,829
generated looking a little bit more of

107
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,440
the membrane pumps carrier proteins

108
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:28,539
whose energy from 80

109
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,670
P to move substances across the membrane

110
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,490
up its concentration period same thing

111
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:36,220
here we see a high amount of potassium

112
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:39,639
ions here we see only one on this side

113
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,740
the pump is pumping them in this case

114
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,569
across requiring energy to move them

115
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,090
across moving that concentration

116
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,129
gradient here we see again here's our

117
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:51,009
potassium coming in and here's our

118
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:54,209
sodium leaving you see ATP bring broken

119
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:56,980
down indicating energy is being required

120
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:58,449
sodium potassium pump is one active

121
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,210
transport system it's very common in

122
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:03,339
cells and again it's moving the sodium

123
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:06,459
which is the NA plus here and the

124
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:07,810
potassium which is the Chi and there's

125
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:10,239
binding and again this is just

126
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,930
representing a protein requiring energy

127
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,079
for this to occur after transports

128
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,470
carrier mediated one ATP so one energy

129
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:23,949
molecule okay right here is moving three

130
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:26,410
sodium's out and two potassium in so

131
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:29,529
it's not always an equal number transfer

132
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,570
so here our binding sites here we have

133
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:34,509
three green molecules in this case these

134
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:37,480
represent the sodium's and two orange

135
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:40,089
representing potassium and this ATP is

136
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,669
causing this movement across it's called

137
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:44,619
a trans membrane potential because it's

138
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:47,019
creating electrical charge across the

139
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,910
membrane so across the membrane is trans

140
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:51,250
membrane and this potential is an

141
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,290
electrical potential it's because these

142
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,199
are both ions and they're moving not in

143
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:59,110
equal amounts causing a shift in the

144
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,800
amount of charges that occur on one side

145
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,960
or the other side of the cell here's our

146
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,060
proton pump okay minor control membranes

147
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,799
in cellular respiration the proton pump

148
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,600
uses energy to transport protons from

149
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,870
the matrix mitochondria to inter

150
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,340
membrane space what does that mean we're

151
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,649
simply taking our hydrogen ions and

152
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:19,119
we're concentrating them on one side

153
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:21,039
they want to diffuse across that can't

154
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,899
get through this phospholipid bilayer

155
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,970
but they can get through this ATP

156
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:27,219
synthase that's this big black molecule

157
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,650
here and because they're moving through

158
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,200
as they're moving through the cell in

159
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:34,179
this case the ATP synthase is harnessing

160
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,819
that energy and it's using that flow of

161
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,788
protons to take adp plus the phosphorus

162
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:41,668
to Train ATP this is an active pump that

163
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:43,709
generates proton proton concentration

164
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:45,699
across the mitochondrial membrane

165
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,889
because there are more protons outside

166
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,509
the matrix and inside and it's the

167
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,399
environment here forcing them through

168
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:53,560
this is part of reason why my tenders

169
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:58,060
have so many folds in them because

170
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:00,399
they're I having a lot of these ATP

171
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:05,228
synthesis in the membranes allowing a

172
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:08,109
lot of energy to be generated the co

173
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:10,029
transport mechanism here capable of

174
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,910
moving substances either with or against

175
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:15,579
their concentration gradients key to key

176
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,860
to terms here are simpler zin anti

177
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:19,349
Porter's so you reporter one partner

178
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,580
just moving one thing in one direction

179
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,320
that's what's going on here binding here

180
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,899
it's being released and pushed to the

181
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,699
other side our co transports are a

182
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:31,389
little different we classify them in two

183
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:33,610
ways so example here we have our

184
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:36,810
symporter 2/7 is move across memory in

185
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,788
this same direction same thing same same

186
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,769
code transport and be on this side of

187
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:43,990
the cell membrane Turvey move to the

188
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:46,598
other side here our anti port system

189
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,490
just as name implies to services with

190
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:51,310
cross-burning in opposite directions and

191
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:54,098
ante directions and is this also called

192
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,598
a counter transport system so if you see

193
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:58,089
here the triangles moving this way and

194
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,459
the green squares moving to the other

195
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:02,799
side in this case here we see them both

196
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:04,589
binding to our protein and they're both

197
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,699
being released on the other side

198
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:10,259
hopefully this helps explain some

199
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,259
transmembrane proteins
