1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,110
don't you hate me get a fingerprint on

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,849
the screen well hopefully this video

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,189
will make you appreciate or at least

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:09,808
take a little bit look harder at what's

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,240
on the screen before you go through and

6
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,308
you'll wipe it off so this is gonna

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,769
focus on fingerprints but same applies a

8
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:19,019
palm prints and foot prints the dermal

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:20,129
papilla I lie atop the dermal ridges and

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,868
that's what we're looking at when we

11
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:23,820
look at a natural fingerprint they're

12
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:24,719
elevated overlying the epidermis into

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,210
dermal ridges

14
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,428
they are swept films because of sweat

15
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,710
pores and they're actually genetically

16
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:34,259
determined so we're going to be looking

17
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,120
at a couple of the key different types

18
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:39,420
there's three main classifications

19
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,089
arches loops and whorls we'll be able to

20
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,230
identify these in greater detail just

21
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,149
for those thinking about getting a

22
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,699
tattoo so if we're talking about skin

23
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,980
the dermis is the receptive site for the

24
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,620
pigment of tattoos so a little bit lower

25
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,959
or deeper down or focusing a little bit

26
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,599
more on how this dermal layer impacts

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,929
the shape or the ridges that occur on

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,879
the surface so starting with

29
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,680
fingerprints awesome the basics no two

30
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,959
people have been found with the exact

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,460
same fingerprint pattern the fingerprint

32
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,769
pattern will remain unchanged for the

33
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,809
life of the individual however the print

34
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,899
itself may change due to permanent scars

35
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,629
or skin diseases or damaged conceal a

36
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,900
little bit of a pie graph 55% typically

37
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,969
have loops 23 whirls 12% arches and 10%

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,830
composites we're going to investigate

39
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,780
each one of these in a little bit more

40
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:28,859
detail just to go back if you're

41
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,659
interested in learning more about

42
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,549
fingerprints I included a couple of

43
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,299
resources down here and some slideshows

44
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,650
to take a look at so continuing on the

45
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,079
three major fingerprint classes are

46
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,759
arches loops and whorls each group is

47
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,629
divided into smaller groups as seen in

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,969
the list below

49
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:47,609
so within arches we have what's called a

50
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,170
plain arch a tented arch loops we have

51
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,209
something called a radial and all our

52
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,070
loop and whirls we have different types

53
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,589
I want to show you some examples of

54
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:58,048
these and so you can be identified what

55
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,100
your own fingerprints are so starting

56
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,079
with the most basic one of the arches

57
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,968
this is the Saint Louis Gateway Arch

58
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:04,319
good thing of that arches are the

59
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:06,449
simplest type of inner plants and

60
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,118
they're formed by ridges I'm either side

61
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,649
of the print and exit the other see here

62
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,580
a plain arch just kind of a little bit

63
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,650
rise here ridges enter one side and

64
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,350
at the other side tinted archers similar

65
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,240
to plate arch but has a spike in the

66
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:22,909
center a little bit more pronounced here

67
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,070
so both of these are arches is because

68
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:27,770
inter plane arches these would be tented

69
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,530
arches loops is where it gets a little

70
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,719
more confusing loops must have one Delta

71
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,759
and one or more it is at and dirt will

72
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,319
leave the same side these patterns are

73
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,739
named for the position relate to the

74
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,669
radius in the ulnar bones the bone the

75
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,920
loop is opening is facing towards so the

76
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:48,439
bone the loop opening is facing towards

77
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,599
is the bone it's the name so let's see

78
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,520
some examples here so we have our left

79
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,959
hand we have our right hand it's

80
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,080
important to remember that wherever your

81
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:00,409
thumb is this portion here this phone is

82
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,110
the radius on the other side here is the

83
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:04,759
ulna and same goes for left and right

84
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,650
hand you can see here's the thumb and

85
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,439
here's the radius the thicker bone and

86
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,080
the ulna is the thinner bone here so

87
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,969
when we have a print here a loop made

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,070
was it the loops the openings are

89
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:18,500
pointing this way well this was made

90
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,939
with a left hand and if we're on this

91
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,830
hand and the roots are pointing this way

92
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:24,500
be pointing towards the radius this

93
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,050
would be a radial loop but if this same

94
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,360
print was made with the left hand okay

95
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:32,300
to be pointing this way and be pointing

96
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,250
actually to the ulna the ulnar loop

97
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,019
would be the proper term for this and

98
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,489
same thing goes here unless this was

99
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:40,340
made at the left hand we pointing to the

100
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,840
the ulnar loop it was made with the

101
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,569
right hand it would be pointing to the

102
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,670
radio loop the Delta that's mentioned

103
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:48,439
are these small regions here from a

104
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:50,929
little Delta little triangle we can see

105
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,639
that evident right here so with loops

106
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,800
it's very important to realize or

107
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,750
identify if it was made with the left

108
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,519
hand or if it was made with the right

109
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,039
hand

110
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,019
continuing on to worlds so worlds have

111
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,090
have at least one ridge that makes or

112
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,069
tends to make a complete circuit they

113
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,810
also have at least two deltas the print

114
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,959
has more than two deltas it's likely

115
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,699
accidental so we see here we see in our

116
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,500
world plane were only of a center pocket

117
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,819
whirl so what we're doing is we're

118
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,310
drawing a line here between the two

119
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:21,228
Delta's in the plane and central pocket

120
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,089
whirls if some of the curved route is

121
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:26,089
touched the line did you see here

122
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:27,439
considered a plane world if none of them

123
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:29,599
touch the center line

124
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,939
we would call a central pocket world

125
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,950
again it's just getting into little more

126
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:37,629
deeper into the classification of worlds

127
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:39,800
there's both a plane in a central pocket

128
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:40,909
worlds part two are actually composite

129
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,069
so we have something called a double

130
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,020
loop world here's our Delta here's

131
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:48,560
another Delta a double loop worlds are

132
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:50,439
comprised of two loops combined into one

133
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,639
print so it's called a double loop

134
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,259
mentioned the composite if the picture

135
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,479
here of a dog and kind of a bird kind of

136
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,829
a merger of two that's what we see kind

137
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,629
of here with an accidental world

138
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:02,959
sometimes you contain two or more

139
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:04,939
patterns and not included including the

140
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,649
plane arch or does not clearly fall

141
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,449
under any of the other categories it's

142
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:10,399
kind of somewhat considered with the

143
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:13,250
miscellaneous category accidental world

144
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:17,029
this composites had a combination of a

145
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,949
few different things so identify each

146
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:22,189
finger print pattern now you'll notice

147
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:24,740
with each finger print ABCDE I also

148
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:27,410
include what hand it was made from

149
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,769
that's very important if we're looking

150
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:33,140
at identifying if we look back we want

151
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:35,599
to make sure if we identify something as

152
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,779
a loop we're going to find the left or

153
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,120
the right hand as an owner or a radial

154
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:43,909
loop based on what direction the

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,139
openings are pointed if it's going back

156
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,240
to the very beginning said arch it

157
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,219
doesn't matter left or right hand loops

158
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,490
it does make a difference in worlds it

159
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,900
does not make a difference so it'd be a

160
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,699
chance to just take a look at this you

161
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:58,668
can pause the video at this point and

162
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:03,740
see if you can defy these various finger

163
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:05,659
prints okay hopefully you've paused the

164
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,460
video when I reveal the answers to you

165
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,610
hope you've gone through and being able

166
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:13,399
