1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,678
now growers of cannabis can be indoors

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,200
or outdoors

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,278
and everyone thinks the other one's

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,480
easier however here i'm going to go over

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,879
how you take your small

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,480
cannabis plant how you transition it to

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,639
an indoor or an outdoor site what are

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,670
the advantages and disadvantages of each

9
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:24,719
here on debaco university

10
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:25,840
[Music]

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,000
all right assuming you have a nice

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,839
little cannabis plant let's go over

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,599
if you put it in an indoor or an outdoor

14
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,159
location where are some of the things

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,238
pros and cons with each so first off

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,238
indoor outdoor production

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,919
where will your ceiling or clone be

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,279
spinning the rest of its cycle you want

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,120
to think about is going to be in the

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,640
indoor or is it going to be in the

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,919
harsher outdoor environment we have a

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,878
little less controls

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,719
but also a little less upfront costs so

24
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,878
first off for indoor

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,640
applications what's the advantages well

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,558
grower has control over the environment

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,198
it can produce higher quality flowers

28
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,799
and it can allow for specific

29
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,679
experimentation so it's great to kind of

30
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,439
have this as

31
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,519
an option if you're looking at creating

32
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,759
experiments looking at strains

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,920
indoor environment that control offers a

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,478
lot of advantages offers a lot of kind

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,879
of

36
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,319
ways to see differences a little bit

37
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,560
better

38
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,438
now the disadvantages of being in an

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,359
indoor production

40
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,719
is simply the cost of all the equipment

41
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,200
that you need as you can see here in

42
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,560
these

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,000
examples these you need to supply the

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,240
lighting you need to supply the water it

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,078
needs to apply the air circulation

46
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,438
there's also challenges in producing

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,000
high total biomass

48
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,039
simply because of the expense associated

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,280
with the area

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,159
you also have a lack of natural outdoor

51
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,439
conditions

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
which again could be advantage can be

53
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,279
disadvantaged but in this case a lack of

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,159
natural outdoor conditions you have to

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
make sure

56
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,680
you're regulating and simulating that

57
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,079
outdoor

58
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
conditions to maximize the growth of

59
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,639
your plants

60
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:56,718
now for those outdoor productions again

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,000
are indoors productions pros and cons

62
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,199
outdoor same thing

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,799
what are some of the advantages of

64
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,439
growing outdoors overall you have

65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,040
reduced

66
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,639
cost of production compared to indoor

67
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,560
production as you just mentioned because

68
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
you get natural sunlight exposure

69
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,520
there is no need to go back to the

70
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
previous slide no you need to have

71
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,200
lights

72
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
here with different wavelengths and

73
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,119
changing out bulbs and you know

74
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
supplying electricity and cooling that

75
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
will get natural sunlight exposure and

76
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,079
that's kind of

77
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
free it's also easy to grow large

78
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
quantities because you don't have to

79
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
worry about or under the constrains

80
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,520
of that kind of lighting application

81
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,319
there however all is not glorious there

82
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,640
are also some

83
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,159
disadvantages to growing outdoors

84
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,679
there's simply a lack of control over

85
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,759
environmental conditions it could be too

86
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,480
much water too little rain

87
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,759
too much sun different soil types so

88
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,799
these are all things to take into

89
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,039
consideration

90
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
it's also increased pest pressure from

91
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,039
natural as well as insects as well as

92
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,000
larger potentially deer

93
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,840
can also impact the area certain soil or

94
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,639
field conditions are not supportive for

95
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,319
plant growth

96
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,079
so you want to be mindful of taking a

97
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,799
soil test so you're not putting your

98
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
plants in an

99
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,439
area that they may look good initially

100
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
but then will not come to term at the

101
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,158
full

102
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,239
end of the harvest cycle so again each

103
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,079
has their advantages and disadvantages

104
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,920
you've got to pick one and you've got to

105
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,280
deal with some of the conditions you may

106
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,598
have control or not control

107
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
over and hopefully will produce a

108
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,318
quality product

109
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,318
regardless of indoor or outdoor

110
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,318
conditions as long as you go about

111
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:22,318
planning
