1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
okay while you think there may only be

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,140
one or a few general types of stems it's

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,269
a couple specialized structures that are

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,218
relate to stems I'm going to run through

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,440
five different specialized stem

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:16,350
structures and give you some indication

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,868
on how they're different and where you

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,640
may have seen them before so starting

9
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:22,198
with the first one our specialized

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,420
temperature something called rhizomes

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,849
these are horizontal stems that grow

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,769
below the surface of the soil we see

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,359
that here we're seeing that roots are

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,668
coming off them and this structure right

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,260
here is called a rhizome these are

16
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,629
horizontal stems and they're growing

17
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,488
below the soil surface so you might

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,170
assume one area here hops is a plant

19
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:41,820
that does this then all of a sudden we

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,739
see another plant that pops up over here

21
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,780
well those two might be connected by a

22
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,669
rhizome witnesses contributes to how

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,939
certain plants can spread very quickly

24
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,250
through an area another form of

25
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,229
specialized stems runners and stolons

26
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,600
there's some other items but they grow

27
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:59,849
above ground if you ever been strawberry

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
picking can you look at one plant very

29
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,420
closely you kind of don't get distracted

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,159
by all the wonderful strawberries that

31
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,540
may be in the area you'll know sir

32
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,180
actually it looks like they're like

33
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,640
connected also clipped with a wire well

34
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,540
these are similar to our rhizomes these

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,030
stolons

36
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,130
are above-ground stems that link these

37
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,840
plants together may help allow

38
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,839
strawberry plants to kind of spread and

39
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,969
grow out so next time your strawberry

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
picking you look at the strawberry yes

41
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,390
that's great but you can also look and

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,250
find the wonders of the stolons and

43
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,640
point them out and show the connections

44
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,069
between certain plants another type of

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,590
specialized stem is tubers they swell in

46
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,938
size from the accumulation of food pry

47
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,430
the most notable example here would be

48
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,078
potatoes this is what potato plants look

49
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,210
like above-ground you've never seen them

50
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,938
before or recognize them we're referring

51
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:50,309
to the tubers which are these swollen

52
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:53,879
areas that accumulate food located below

53
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,680
ground so again this shows the potato

54
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,839
plant above ground and these are the

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,579
tubers below ground so all your french

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,950
fries and potato chips come from these

57
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:04,228
specialized stems which is the plant

58
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,320
accumulating food below the soil surface

59
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:09,780
we see here they're held up and then in

60
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,359
this Hill is where all the potatoes

61
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,860
ideally will be developing and accusing

62
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,000
the sugars the cute

63
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,210
from the leaves through the

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,219
photosynthetic process another type of

65
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,260
specialized stem is bulbs there's small

66
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,349
stem located at the base surrounded by

67
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,599
fleshy leaves so if you ever had to

68
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,239
plant bulbs you might have to plant them

69
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,609
at various depths based on what point it

70
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,000
is and you'll notice here our daffodils

71
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,980
are very commonly seen in the springtime

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,689
same thing with our crocuses both of

73
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,299
these are very early plants and they

74
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,620
grow in the early spring when there's

75
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,660
not a lot of kind of energy or

76
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,870
competition and because they have this

77
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:51,449
kind of stored area this kind of energy

78
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,520
stored in the bulb region they

79
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:55,560
specialized them they're able to grow

80
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,750
early and take advantage of some of the

81
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,949
Sun before some of the larger trees make

82
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,479
shade out in the area

83
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,699
crocuses my people with some of the

84
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,679
first things you see a lot of times they

85
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,689
made Germany even before a recent

86
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,450
snowstorm getting closer to springtime

87
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,370
and daffodils are these large yellow

88
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:15,089
flowers typically in a clump here which

89
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,099
you may see last type is called a quorum

90
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,049
and on a quick look they look very

91
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,959
similar to bulbs but they contain almost

92
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,040
all stem tissue so again go back for a

93
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,349
second just for that source of

94
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,169
comparison it's your small stems looking

95
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:29,430
at a basis run by fleshy leaves so kind

96
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,708
of all these leaves located here if we

97
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,870
take the cross section the bulbs do that

98
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,239
same cross section with a quorum we

99
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,670
noticed in this instance there's some of

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,489
the bulbs on the exterior look but they

101
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:44,069
contain almost all Staten tissue and if

102
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,259
you ever eaten garlic or familiar with

103
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,239
garlic garlic is a prime example of a

104
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,090
quorum and again if you take the cross

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,049
section it's all just about all stem

106
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,129
tissue here it looks like on the outside

107
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,540
hopefully this is helpful and going over

108
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:59,870
some of the specialized stems that do

109
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,870
exist
