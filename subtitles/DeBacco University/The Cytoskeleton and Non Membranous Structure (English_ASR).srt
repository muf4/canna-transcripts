1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
so here we're gonna be looking at the

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,229
cytoskeleton in non membranous

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,550
structures within the cell kind of a

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,740
cool picture here showing some of the

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,980
interior structures that occur within a

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,948
cell so first off we have ribosomes so

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,329
kind of an important component to cells

8
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:20,219
in this site in the sense that they are

9
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,469
the site of protein synthesis within the

10
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,559
cell they're composed of our RNA that's

11
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:27,660
ribosomal RNA and they have a large and

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,028
small subunit we can see here the large

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,609
and the red and the small in the blue

14
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:34,469
these subunits are made in the nucleolus

15
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:38,189
of the salad sends me the little dark

16
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,200
circle you see within the nucleus now

17
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:41,669
one large and one small subunits make a

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,370
functional ribosome you need both

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,280
components there to be functional to

20
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,718
allow those proteins to be made so we

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,579
kind of look at the image here

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,050
remember that brightest tones are

23
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,489
three-dimensional so that's why I kind

24
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:54,959
of show this kind of three-dimensional

25
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,939
shape here and they're important shape

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,739
allows them to perform their very

27
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:00,299
important function so you have their

28
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,119
messenger RNA that comes out of the

29
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:05,459
nucleus then there's two subunits of the

30
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,489
ribosome come together and they allow

31
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,039
that translation process to occur to

32
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:14,069
allow messenger RNA to essentially be

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,850
translated into a polypeptide chain

34
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:18,959
which ultimately will form a protein now

35
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:21,509
these ribosomes

36
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,280
may be located either in the endoplasmic

37
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,009
reticulum there when they can get rough

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,320
we can see here these little purple

39
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,578
circles here would be the rough the

40
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,679
rough would be the ribosomes and the

41
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:33,959
rough ER and they're also free in the

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,118
cytoplasm making current small groups or

43
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,259
they can kind of be free-floating so

44
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,540
we're not just attached to the

45
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,280
endoplasmic reticulum they can also be

46
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,229
free-floating no matter where they're

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,040
located they're doing this same basic

48
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:48,688
function now ribosomes are RNA protein

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,850
complex is composed of two subunits

50
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:53,609
joined in attaching that messenger RNA

51
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,259
in the center here there's a site of

52
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:57,000
that protein synthesis and they're

53
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,340
assembled in that nucleoli and we see

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,170
here the mRNA coming through and our

55
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,570
newly born protein which is those

56
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,118
linking of all those amino acids that

57
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:08,639
are brought together by the transfer RNA

58
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:11,068
here and the sequence is very important

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,769
for their function going into the

60
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:14,159
cytoskeleton in eukaryotic skeleton is

61
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,960
in

62
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,400
or of filaments and tubes that extend

63
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,830
from the nucleus to the plasma membrane

64
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,330
that support the cell shape and anchor

65
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,940
organelles it's kind of like the

66
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,620
interior webbing to the cell helps it

67
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,020
maintain its shape and assist its

68
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,819
movement of the cell and organelles

69
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,909
within it it's assembled and

70
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:35,069
disassembled as needed depending on the

71
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:38,490
particular functions that the cell needs

72
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:41,340
to be carrying out now within that set

73
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,980
of skeleton there are three types of Mac

74
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,099
of macro molecular fibers actin

75
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,479
intermediate in microtubules so you'll

76
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,849
see here they both have kind of this

77
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,299
very interesting hair like kind of

78
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:56,340
structural component view to them within

79
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,340
those actin filaments they're stress

80
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,140
fibers that within the cytoskeleton and

81
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,840
they help with the cell move with

82
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,939
motility they're extremely fine and they

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,370
twist like pearl necklace here I get

84
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,409
help give them some strength the dense

85
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,090
web just under the plasma membrane that

86
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,789
maintains the cell shape and they

87
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,370
support the micro villi and I've also

88
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:19,560
found in intestinal cells and we have

89
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,080
also have with the cytoskeleton as I

90
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,020
said in the small intestine

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,790
so this Interceptor traffic control from

92
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,790
moving components around within the cell

93
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:31,319
also cell is plasma streaming these kind

94
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:32,579
of a red lines represent the actin

95
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,019
filaments and their whole point is to

96
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,160
kind of keep these villi apart we don't

97
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,570
want them all together we want to

98
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,090
maintain this high surface area to

99
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:41,879
volume ratio and actin filaments help

100
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,640
that within those actin filaments they

101
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,069
can pinch mother cell into two after

102
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,929
animal mitosis so it's important

103
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,389
component in muscle cells also for

104
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,860
contraction other than myosin these are

105
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,079
indications these are very strong

106
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,030
filaments able to kind of pull those

107
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,070
cells apart during the mitotic process

108
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,750
also important for your muscles when

109
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:03,000
you're having contractions to occur

110
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,520
allowing that sliding filament theory to

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,530
occur those have to be very strong to

112
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,959
endure the stresses that those cells are

113
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,280
under we also have intermediate

114
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,229
filaments and to get their name because

115
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,120
their intermediate in size between actin

116
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:18,418
and microtubules and the Rope like

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,100
assembly of fibrous polypeptides again

118
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,680
this twisting action can help increase

119
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,280
their strength without necessarily

120
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,870
causing a large increase in bulk so they

121
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,549
vary in nature they

122
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,709
from tissue the tissue from time to time

123
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,110
so these intermediate ones can kind of

124
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:36,029
change a little bit they do function to

125
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,500
support the nuclear envelope cell uh

126
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:39,689
cell junctions like those holding the

127
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,209
skin cells tightly together so do some

128
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:44,879
vital components but they are not kind

129
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:46,379
of one particularly set thing they can

130
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,500
vary a little bit from tissue to tissue

131
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,819
in the time to time as well keratin we

132
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,529
might be familiar with the structure of

133
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:54,509
our hair has composed of a lot of

134
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:56,939
intermediate filaments nuclear plasma

135
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:59,099
membrane connections and gives you that

136
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:02,759
idea of how something can be very thin

137
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,470
but yet also very strong keratin is

138
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,060
composed those intermediate filaments to

139
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,080
be a little bit there they also have

140
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,819
your braids right here you know it can

141
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,439
be stronger in that ways and that's kind

142
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,740
of what these can do on the molecular

143
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:16,949
level these microtubules

144
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,410
these are intracellular transport

145
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:21,629
chromosome segregation and these are

146
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,000
like microtubules are like little tubes

147
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:26,519
on their hollow cylinders and made up of

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,918
two globular proteins alpha and beta

149
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,180
tubulin kind of here's a cross-section

150
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:32,788
to kind of show you that kind of like

151
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,860
two but that they do have in their

152
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:36,779
appearance their assembly they're under

153
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,180
control of microtubules in the organ

154
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,459
organization Center most important is

155
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,220
the centrosome when we're looking at

156
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:47,819
kind of dividing a cell you see here

157
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,160
interact with other proteins and cause

158
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,569
the movement of organelles within a cell

159
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,849
so we want to just think about cell

160
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:55,589
dividing that's one but also organelles

161
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:58,139
need to be moving within a cell in

162
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:00,119
microtubules help with that they're

163
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,650
important for motor proteins so it's a

164
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,620
motor protein will lives helped use

165
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:06,750
energy from ATP hydrolysis to move

166
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,310
proteins along the substrate helping

167
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,930
that movement we've talked about sliding

168
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,189
filament theory you're seeing that

169
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,740
movement that's occurring in

170
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:16,228
microtubules are an important component

171
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,569
for that there's centrioles there's

172
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:20,370
hollow cylinders as we can see here

173
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:23,069
they're short cylinders they have a nine

174
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,750
plus a zero pattern for micro to do

175
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,149
triplets it helps give them kind of like

176
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,300
a collection of straws is a way to think

177
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:31,439
about it at least how they look visually

178
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,538
the centrioles found mostly in

179
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,259
eukaryotic cells involved in the process

180
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:35,579
of cell division

181
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,649
Sam shows may be involved with

182
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,959
microtubule formation disassembly during

183
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:41,719
cell division and in the organization of

184
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,430
cilia and flagella which I'm gonna talk

185
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,860
a little bit more detail you can see

186
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:49,930
again it looks almost like a circular

187
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:52,580
form of uncooked pasta for example

188
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,709
now these microtubule arrays of cilia

189
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,810
and flagella they contain specialized

190
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:58,759
arrangements of microtubules therefore

191
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,120
local motion they help the cell move

192
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:05,629
cilia and flagella share in common ultra

193
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,389
structure however cilia is only found in

194
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,370
eukaryotes as an important no procures

195
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,419
do not have cilia so if you see cilia

196
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,660
you immediately know you're dealing with

197
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,910
a eukaryote prokaryotes do not have

198
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,270
cilia and we see it's kind of the

199
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,610
picture here of a flagella now getting

200
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:24,829
to a little bit more detail here cilia

201
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,379
small numerous Vaghela tend to be large

202
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:29,359
and single see the flagella here on a

203
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,860
sperm cell and we have the silly here

204
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,980
kind of in a surface opaque little tiny

205
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,139
hairs or appendages so if Adele helped

206
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:39,950
both help move when the micro to be

207
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,870
double side past one another each cilium

208
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:43,879
or flagellum has a basal body at its

209
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:48,019
base kind of acts as an anchoring point

210
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:50,540
to help that cell move the flagella are

211
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:52,129
hairlike projections in the cell that

212
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,860
aidan movement and our found in both

213
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:57,379
prokaryotes and eukaryotes prokaryotic

214
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,060
flagella are small there's simple

215
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,759
structure of rotary movement and our

216
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,519
proton driven you character Gela because

217
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,500
both can have alpha Gela they tend to be

218
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,168
larger and more complex structure you

219
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,689
have a bending movement so kind of think

220
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:13,549
about it was one kind of like spins like

221
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:16,339
a rotary movement and when it's kind of

222
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,228
just a back and forth movement and

223
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:22,189
that's to see the comparison between the

224
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:23,810
procure and Eukarya jello now in new

225
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:26,810
carrots cilia are much shorter than

226
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,759
flagella cilia move in coordinated waves

227
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,129
like oars or kind of like the wheat in

228
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,210
the wind often used in preventing dust

229
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:34,219
accumulation from your respiratory

230
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,288
system so it's kind of like as a

231
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,150
filtering component so gentle move like

232
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:40,279
a propeller or a corkscrew kind of that

233
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:42,620
kind of like rotary movement there and

234
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,149
commonly used for locomotion just as

235
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,700
they wouldn't about they help the cells

236
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,959
move as well

237
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,520
cilia only found in eukaryotes for

238
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,780
movement you can see that forward stroke

239
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,789
in that back strip you're kind of that

240
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:55,279
back and forth kind of motion like kind

241
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:55,759
of kelp in the rising and falling tide

242
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,860
of

243
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:02,929
in the waves for our eukaryotes cilia

244
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,279
and flagella motion the flagella as they

245
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:06,409
said moves in kind of a snake-like

246
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,720
propelling cells kind of back and forth

247
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:11,659
motion in this silly have that direct

248
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,210
back and forth so when I say that motion

249
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,740
of flagella kind of like that propelling

250
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,680
cells kinda like that propeller kind of

251
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,629
spinning if you will these cilia have

252
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,729
that true back and forth at a fixed

253
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:24,710
point back and forth motion and it's

254
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,060
like a beating rate for about 40 or 60

255
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,850
strokes in a second so they're moving

256
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:30,949
very quickly I have a picture here kind

257
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,320
of think of like the kelp and underneath

258
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,560
the ocean it's very slow movement but

259
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,600
the same general movement there

260
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:40,309
lastly the extracellular matrix so it's

261
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,350
secreted by cells it's on the exterior

262
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:45,049
portion of the cell large number of

263
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,909
fibrous proteins collagen is one example

264
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:49,219
might be familiar with hearing that in

265
00:09:46,909 --> 00:09:50,779
to good hair products it's bound by

266
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,910
integrant so it's helping kind of like

267
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,289
stick everything together helping that

268
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:56,179
cell communicate potentially with other

269
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:57,860
cells and bind together that

270
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,269
extracellular matrix can also be

271
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,850
important for communication between

272
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:05,649
cells so just another example of a

273
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,649
component within our cells
