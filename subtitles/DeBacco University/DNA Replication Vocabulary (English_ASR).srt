1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,279
okay here i'm going to cover some

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,439
necessary dna

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,119
replication vocabulary you need to be

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,480
able to understand because these terms

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,440
will be used

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,839
as quote common knowledge in the process

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,558
of

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,679
dna replication we see a couple of them

9
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,439
labeled here

10
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,960
so if this initially doesn't make a lot

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,640
of sense hopefully after you watch the

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,719
video you come back to this

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,000
you'll be able to understand it more

14
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,518
fully

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,198
so starting with the basics of words we

16
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,358
have something called a helicase

17
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
it's an enzyme that binds to nucleic

18
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,520
acids and it separates or

19
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,520
unwinds dna into single strands this is

20
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,040
going to allow each strand to be copied

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,480
see the helicase here represented by

22
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,000
this triangle and that's taking this

23
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,398
double stranded

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,119
helix and separating out into single

25
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
strands

26
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,558
because we're looking at the process of

27
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,079
replication we know it occurs in a

28
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,399
semi-conservative way

29
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,719
we need to isolate each of those

30
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,679
individual parental strands into single

31
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,280
strands now when we're rejoining our dna

32
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,960
into the single strands making it that

33
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
double-stranded again looking

34
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,640
back in this region of the top lagging

35
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,198
strand and here down here the leading

36
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,359
strand

37
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,359
we have a process called annealing

38
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,959
that's when dna is rejoined

39
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,319
this can happen when dna is cooled as

40
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,599
well that annealing is just think of

41
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,279
it's like that sticking those back

42
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,640
together those hydrogen bonds are

43
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,920
reforming important vocabulary words

44
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840
and these aren't necessarily words these

45
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,759
are numbers but really important to

46
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,040
understand the orientation

47
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,599
of dna we have a five prime that's what

48
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
the little

49
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,640
indication here is five prime carbon has

50
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,560
a phosphate group attached to it

51
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,000
and the three prime carbon has a

52
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,920
hydroxyl or oh

53
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,280
group attached to it so a lot of these

54
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,560
you'll see these little fives and these

55
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,239
little threes

56
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,759
this is referring to the number five

57
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,719
carbon and number three

58
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
carbon it's really important for

59
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,920
orientation

60
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,719
because there is a quote right and a

61
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,079
wrong way

62
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,319
that bases can be added so taking those

63
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,039
terms those 5 prime and three prime

64
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,078
terms and relating them to dna

65
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
polymerase

66
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,199
which is an enzyme that creates dna

67
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,520
molecules by assembling the nucleotides

68
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
this polymerase it's an enzyme ace this

69
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,038
is an enzyme that's putting things

70
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,079
together attaching nucleotides

71
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,799
it always synthesizes in the five to

72
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,719
three prime

73
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
direction so we see it looking here

74
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,159
here's the five

75
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
it's a three prime direction that's the

76
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,759
only way that

77
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,719
this enzyme can operate enzymes shapes

78
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,318
are very important

79
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,479
and these molecules we saw on the

80
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,399
previous slide can only bind in the five

81
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,079
to three prime direction

82
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,599
because it can only bind to and add

83
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,000
nucleotides to that three

84
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,280
prime end now when we're separating out

85
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
our dna we'll notice

86
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
that it is kind of like inverse one's

87
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,120
going one way one's going

88
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,878
the other way so when we have this

89
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,759
synthesizing in the five to three prime

90
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,598
direction

91
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,598
here's our leading strand the easiest to

92
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,119
understand because that's going through

93
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,439
and it's going in the five

94
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
to 3 prime direction now we're going to

95
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,000
say initially well what about this 3

96
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,159
prime here well because it has to be

97
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,080
anti-parallel

98
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,400
so we see a 3 prime here there's going

99
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
to be a 5 prime here and 5 to 3 prime is

100
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,280
perfectly

101
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
well how dna periods can go right along

102
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,039
and we see no breaks

103
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,479
in that sequence on this other strand

104
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,598
here we have a five primes we need a

105
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,158
three prime here

106
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,119
it cannot work in this same direction so

107
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,199
it's going to kind of work

108
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,039
backwards we call this the lagging

109
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,878
strand because it's going to work here

110
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,639
and get to the end and have to detach

111
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,518
and kind of come back over and bind here

112
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,359
and work again

113
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,799
there's these little kind of sections

114
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,720
these little fragments

115
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,040
these fragments are called okazaki

116
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,639
fragments and they're short dna segments

117
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,479
that form on the lagging strand during

118
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,158
the replication process

119
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,199
simply because that polymerase has to

120
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,639
work in the five to three prime

121
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,479
direction we can see here

122
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,119
helicase hasn't opened up the dna

123
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,439
molecule fully so it's working from here

124
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,519
to the end it's got a de-attach and

125
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,120
reattach here and come back this way

126
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,719
here the leading strand it can just keep

127
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
working right along because that three

128
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,759
prime

129
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,039
end is exposed and polymerase only works

130
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,359
in the five to three prime

131
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,000
direction we also have rna primers which

132
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,920
are very

133
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
short strands of rna that act as the

134
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,798
starting point they're kind of like the

135
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,519
little flags that say

136
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,239
dna polymerases start here and we have a

137
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,920
dna

138
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,519
ligase which is an enzyme that

139
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,399
facilitates in the joining of these

140
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,719
strands

141
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
ligase think of it as it links things

142
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,840
together it's

143
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,358
linking on those bonds together and

144
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,079
forming something very stable

145
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,439
which we want for our dna so hopefully

146
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,199
now if we look at our

147
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,279
beginning image here this makes a little

148
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
bit more sense we're saying leading and

149
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,198
lagging strands

150
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,399
and good vocab terms to review as we get

151
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,960
into the replication

152
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,959
process
