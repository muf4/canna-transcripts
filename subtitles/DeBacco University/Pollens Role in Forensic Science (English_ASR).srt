00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
welcome to tobacco university's video

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,960
presentation

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,638
of pollen's role in forensic science so

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,559
while we may not consider palm to be a

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,359
vital role in forensic science

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:13,678
those that are very detail-oriented and

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,239
can

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,118
discover this it may play a very

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,839
important

10
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:22,240
aspect of the evidence collection for

11
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,960
pinpointing a crime scene

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,439
so pollen's main role pollen is simply

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,719
that

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,839
small little tiny almost dust-like

15
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:34,320
appearance that flowers will produce for

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,759
the gold pollination to produce seeds so

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
pollen is used to help provide those

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,199
links this can take on different forms

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,559
but the goal is to aid

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,800
in allowing to strengthen a case with

21
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,238
increased evidence linking so while it

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,119
may not be the only thing

23
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,159
used it can help strengthen a case and

24
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,959
really provide

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,078
an investigator some solid evidence and

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,759
information

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,079
we want to make note that the same

28
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,960
concepts can be also applied to spores

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
that are applied here as shown for

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,558
pollen

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,798
now what is pollen well pond is simply

32
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,640
the male reproductive cell of flowering

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
plants those angiosperms

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,239
and cone bearing plants those

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,000
gymnosperms found

36
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,879
nearly everywhere which makes it great

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,118
to consider for crime scenes

38
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,118
and pollen has many unique shapes and

39
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,079
sizes when viewed with the aid of a

40
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,319
microscope

41
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,118
we may see it here as this all this kind

42
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,478
of little tiny yellow particulate here

43
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,640
but under a microscope it can look

44
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,319
vastly different within the same genus

45
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,239
there are often similarities

46
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,679
but between different plant species

47
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,280
there's definitely some noticeable

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,280
differences

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
as this pollen can be kind of like

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,879
nature's snapshot which what does that

51
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,478
mean well pollen can help identify the

52
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,560
area or the region

53
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,560
that a particular crime may have

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,118
occurred it can produce a pollen

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,600
fingerprint meaning what plants exist in

56
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,239
what area if we find that pollen we know

57
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,078
that on that individual that garment or

58
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,599
that clothing have to be present in a

59
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,759
certain region

60
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,959
can also help us pinpoint potentially

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,359
the time of year

62
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,519
meaning what pollen is found what

63
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,118
flowers bloom during certain times so

64
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,159
there might be a limited window for

65
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,080
certain plants

66
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,680
and that might really help determine the

67
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,520
time of year

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,719
that that garment was found or that that

69
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,760
clothing was present

70
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,199
at that crime scene now ponca used to

71
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,878
determine if the body was in a

72
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,560
particular place at a specific time

73
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,000
frame it can also identify the season

74
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,920
the crime was committed

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
if a body is discovered and contains

76
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,958
non-native pollen it was likely

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,479
moved prior to its present location so

78
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,640
all these can be vital

79
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,840
information that can be gathered to

80
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,799
again help strengthen

81
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,800
a case when we're looking at developing

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
what may have occurred at a particular

83
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,439
crime scene

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,719
now as i mentioned the pollen can have

85
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,439
very different looks well what do you

86
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,359
look for

87
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,598
you want to visually inspect with a

88
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,720
microscope when i look at the pawn shape

89
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,799
you want to look at the size

90
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,800
the surface texture and not knowing

91
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,640
anything about pollen in general if you

92
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
look at the images located down over

93
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,958
here

94
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,518
we can definitely see there are some

95
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,640
distinctive visual differences

96
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
good investigator would compare

97
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,439
specimens from the crime scene with that

98
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,598
on the suspect

99
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,120
and or victim to determine if there's a

100
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,598
similar pollen signature

101
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,800
or the likelihood of there being a match

102
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,799
between those two
