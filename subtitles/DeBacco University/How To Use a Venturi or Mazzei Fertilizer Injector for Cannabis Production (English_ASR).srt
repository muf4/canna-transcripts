00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,640
going to go over how to set up a venturi

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,919
style

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,679
or what's commonly referred to as a

5
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:17,210
massey fertilizer injector

6
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:18,240
for cannabis plant production

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,000
[Music]

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,839
ever wonder how to use a venturi or

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,559
massey fertilizer injector for canvas

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,599
production

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,159
well this video here is for you

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,679
so let's get into some of the details so

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,159
first off the method of

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,399
operation well chemicals are injected

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,238
into a pressurized pipe using a venturi

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,399
principle so here basically you have a

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,078
large area of restricted area and that's

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,039
the venturi concept

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,320
the venturing injector is tapered as we

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,159
can see right here

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,000
to constrict which operates in the

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,159
principle the pressure drop accompanies

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,679
the change in the velocity of the water

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,839
as it passes through the constriction

25
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,119
point the pressure drop through the

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,039
venturi

27
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,280
must be sufficient to create negative

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,679
pressure which is essentially a

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,600
vacuum to some degree and as measured

30
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,799
relatively atmospheric pressure

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,879
with that result that pressure loss

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,640
may cause not to operate properly in

33
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,079
systems that already have low pressure

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,159
because you are going to or these

35
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,280
operate with the change in pressure

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
if you already have low pressure to

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,159
begin with this may not be the best

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,759
option for you

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,080
under those conditions the fluid from

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
the tank will flow into the injectors we

41
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,560
have that pressure difference that

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,759
vacuum that negative pressure

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,759
it's going to start to pull some of this

44
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,759
liquid up and inject it into

45
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,680
the irrigation water most ventricular

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,478
injectors require at least 20 percent

47
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,759
pressure differential to initiate this

48
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,478
negative pressure

49
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,280
a full vacuum of 20 inches of mercury is

50
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:40,640
obtained

51
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,478
with a different pressure of five

52
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,560
percent or more and we could see here

53
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,359
that also depending on the size of your

54
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
irrigation

55
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,280
they make different sized venturi

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,320
operated injectors

57
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,840
typically called massey injectors now

58
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,879
this pressure drop is needed so small

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,560
venturi

60
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,560
can be used to inject small chemical

61
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,960
flow rates to a relatively large

62
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,799
main line by shutting a portion of the

63
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,798
flow through the injector

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,719
to assure that water will flow through

65
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,759
the shunt a pressure drop must occur in

66
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,679
the main line

67
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,199
since our inlet and outlet sizes are the

68
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,400
same but there will be a pressure

69
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,479
reduction

70
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,480
as a result the injector is used to run

71
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,159
a point of restriction such as a valve

72
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,519
orifice or pressure regulator or other

73
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,598
device which creates a

74
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,879
differential pressure so placement of

75
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,399
this could also be

76
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,479
important just to ensure that it

77
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,599
operates properly now there are some

78
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,759
additional components

79
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,878
in here gaskets and springs also be

80
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,959
mindful of

81
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,479
but overall basically very minimal

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,319
components

83
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,598
now the venturi advantage so why would

84
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,439
someone choose to operate

85
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,280
uh with this style we can see that right

86
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,359
here is that it doesn't require external

87
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,800
power to operate it's a great advantage

88
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,720
does not really have any moving parts

89
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,560
associated with it has a long

90
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,878
operational life expectancy

91
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,000
low probability of failure both great

92
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,759
things for growers

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
resistant to many chemicals do the heavy

94
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,120
plastic construction

95
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,360
requires minimal operator retention once

96
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,039
it's set up very low maintenance

97
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
reduced cost definitely compared to some

98
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,759
other systems and adaptable to new or

99
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,598
existing

100
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,359
systems again assuming sufficient

101
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,799
pressure so this is why these can be

102
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,840
very popular

103
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
with many fertilizer injector systems

104
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,878
so when we're looking at the liquid

105
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,318
levels they mentioned venture injectors

106
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,359
come in various sizes and can be

107
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,399
operated on different pressure

108
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,400
conditions

109
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,840
the suction can pass capacity or the

110
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,680
injection rate

111
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
head loss required and working pressure

112
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,480
range will depend on the model you

113
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,120
specifically select

114
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,399
so do that research ahead of time it is

115
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,000
important to realize that suction

116
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,959
capacity depends on the liquid level in

117
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,039
the tank

118
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,319
and as the liquid level drops the

119
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,318
suction head

120
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,238
increases resulting in a decreased

121
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,919
injection rate so there will be some

122
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
inconsistencies particularly using a

123
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,039
very thin

124
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,560
but tall container to avoid this problem

125
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,639
some manufacturers provide an additional

126
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,318
small tank on the side to supply

127
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,079
a supply tank their float valve

128
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,039
maintains the fluid level relatively

129
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
consistently

130
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,479
the fluid is injected from this

131
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,238
additional tank however this may cause

132
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,518
inconsistent fertilizer dilution rates

133
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
at the start compared to the end of the

134
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,640
irrigation

135
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,760
cycle unless you're injecting in water

136
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,000
of the same

137
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,598
fertilizer concentration so again just a

138
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,239
few little things to consider

139
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,919
but this is why this one is so popular

140
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,840
because it offers a lot of advantages at

141
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,679
really reduced cost

142
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,120
especially for operations that have

143
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,918
sufficient or excessive

144
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,918
pressure
