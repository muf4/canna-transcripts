1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,359
here I'll be providing a little

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,450
background and Pythium also known as

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:09,480
damping off and with the picture here in

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,000
the title slide this is a disease that

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,859
particularly attacks the roots or the

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,660
root structure of plants so it's

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:19,100
important to be able to find a way to

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:23,278
inspect those if you suspect that your

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,260
crop is infected with Pythium so first

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,268
off identification so there's different

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,029
species of Pythium but they all have

12
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:31,768
similar preferred conditions that's very

13
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:33,808
common in younger plants or seedlings as

14
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:36,780
we see here can reduce the germination

15
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:38,308
rate when using seeds now what's kind of

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,109
unique about this disease is well we

17
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:42,689
have an entire flat here of plants

18
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:45,628
growing UT Pythium will affect certain

19
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:48,030
areas so it may not be widespread and

20
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:51,149
infect all plants but it may occur in

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,280
small pockets now if you find a pocket

22
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,429
here where plants are becoming infected

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,719
you look closer at those seedlings

24
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:00,179
typically if you look at the base the

25
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,039
stem and soil point of intersection is

26
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:04,500
where you'll see this kind of browning

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,260
and discoloration this can include

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,510
plants that are wilting we have a yellow

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,969
coloration to their leaves and the key

30
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,770
part here is to you see that in a plant

31
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:16,170
especially a seedling inspect this soil

32
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,118
line to see if you see conditions that

33
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,859
look like this above the soil might be

34
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,739
perfectly green but at that soil line

35
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,019
typically the air you find that now this

36
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:28,438
disease is very rarely found in soilless

37
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:30,390
mixes but can be easily unintentionally

38
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,029
inoculated by growers using either dirty

39
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,430
tools from an infected area or ever

40
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,210
using some soil are having very cool

41
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,829
temperatures in their ceiling flats now

42
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,688
again where to look it's encouraged by

43
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:45,359
over watering and poor drainage so you

44
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:47,609
want to look at that soil line the root

45
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,950
tips are often brown and dead resulting

46
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,780
in stunted plants this brown tissue and

47
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,759
the outer portion of it easily pulls off

48
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,218
leaving strand of vascular tissue

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,718
exposed so if you do see this you do go

50
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:00,328
physically kind of rub your fingers

51
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,789
around this typically that very outer

52
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,629
coating will come off very easily and if

53
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,310
you're looking at a quick inspection

54
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,739
look right at that soil lines can see

55
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,739
that Brown ring that's an indication you

56
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:12,810
could have Pythium or damping off how to

57
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,590
prevent this keeping tools and interiors

58
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,229
clean and sterile

59
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,030
important control fungus gnat larvae

60
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,250
these can aid in this spread of Pythia

61
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,019
I'm especially growing conditions this

62
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,330
is where control onion insect can help

63
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:26,819
prevent a disease for flood and drain

64
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,250
setups a strain filters recommend to

65
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,229
prevent media from flowing into the

66
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,650
reservoir which can carry the disease

67
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:37,259
that way and of inoculate on sadly your

68
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,299
reservoir conditions at paper Pythium

69
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,399
are high salts over watering in wet

70
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:43,830
weather conditions and we mat have

71
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,459
control over all of those keeping in

72
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,829
mind that these are areas that you can

73
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,629
look at to on records and documentation

74
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:53,939
may be doing to see if you are kind of

75
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,829
falling into one of these categories if

76
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,259
you have fast drying growing media that

77
00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:00,090
may be a way to discourage the formation

78
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,039
Pythium and a way for you to prevent it

79
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,870
we see again in this image here we're

80
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,818
receiving that kind of initial area kind

81
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,250
of spreading out but not affecting all

82
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:10,078
plants you never see Pythium infected

83
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,759
roots compared to what normal or healthy

84
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,250
look roots should look like

85
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,019
seems he definitely is that reduction in

86
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,289
total root area that's also going to

87
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,849
affect the above-ground growth how to

88
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,500
control it what's difficult to control

89
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,329
once it's established make sure

90
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,400
irrigation water is clean in the sense

91
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,400
it's disease-free this is a particularly

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,709
important for using recirculated water

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,969
fungicides can be an option but use them

94
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,549
with caution and follow labels

95
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:38,219
instructions and they may not offer a

96
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,049
great level of control see here with

97
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,939
port cities where one area is infected

98
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,439
and other plants are not in this case

99
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:45,090
you might have removed these plants and

100
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,769
definitely ensure that the water from

101
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,259
these plants it's not going through and

102
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,709
infecting the entire crop in this grove

103
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:51,709
facility
