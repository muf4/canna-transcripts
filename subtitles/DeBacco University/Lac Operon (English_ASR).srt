1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,040
so here we're going to learn about the

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,080
loch operon

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,918
and also see a simulation on exactly how

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,800
it works to get a better understanding

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,279
for it

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,719
so first off the lac operon lac stands

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,798
for lactose

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,640
and this is an example of a sequence of

9
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,839
genes so an operon in general is a

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,920
sequence of genes

11
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,679
may be found in many bacteria that

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,840
encodes for enzymes needed to break down

13
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,920
lactose to glucose and galactose

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,198
so sugars can be utilized studies on the

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
lac operon have been important for

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
genetic research

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,159
the lactose receptor proteins control

18
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,520
the transcription of the lac

19
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,919
operon now this operon again is it is in

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,200
uh bacteria so i do show the glass of

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
milk here anything if you drink galaxy

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
milk you're activating your own

23
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,799
lac operon not necessarily the case but

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,520
this is give a good example here

25
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,878
of taking a lactose and with the lactase

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,600
enzyme and breaking down

27
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:54,799
into galactose and glucose which can be

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,960
absorbed by the body and other organisms

29
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,878
so the lac operon the lactose operon

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,239
will be the full term here an operon is

31
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:01,759
a segment of dna

32
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,519
that contains a cluster of genes that

33
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,079
are transcribed as a unit and are

34
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,799
involved

35
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,599
in lactose metabolism lack is short for

36
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,600
lactose

37
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,839
the disaccharide composed of galactose

38
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,798
and glucose that is found in milk and

39
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,400
other products

40
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,000
but as i stressed before note that

41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,960
operons occur primarily

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,319
in prokaryotes keep in mind you are a

43
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,399
eukaryotic organism

44
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,679
so while operons do occur mostly in

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
prokaryotes

46
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,200
this is a simulation it does provide a

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,599
good model for

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,680
gene expression so take it for what it's

49
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,000
worth in that regards

50
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
now when we're looking at the lac operon

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
it's repressed when no

52
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,679
lactose is present so the cell doesn't

53
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,000
want to make this enzyme if there's

54
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,840
nothing

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,239
to break down so in the absence of

56
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,200
lactose the lac repressor binds to the

57
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,239
operator

58
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
that repressor here is going to prevent

59
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,199
that gene from being

60
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,559
made the operator here is kind of like

61
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,359
the light switch that says go or don't

62
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
go

63
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,599
so by binding a repressor it's going to

64
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,399
prevent anything from downstream of that

65
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,000
from being expressed so rna polymerase

66
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,320
cannot access the promoter therefore the

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,200
lac

68
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,239
operon is shut down in this example it's

69
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,759
important to shut down there's no

70
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,318
lactose present in a high

71
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,120
glucose glucose is a favored energy

72
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,519
source

73
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
now in low glucose and lactose not

74
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,280
available again

75
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,280
the lac gene is also not going to be

76
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,120
expressed

77
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,560
now lycopter is activated when lactose

78
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,159
is present so in this case now we have

79
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,360
lactose being available and we have low

80
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,959
amounts of glucose

81
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
so in the presence of lactose the

82
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,400
metabolite of

83
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,560
the lactose is called aloe lactose

84
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,159
binds to the repressor and this induces

85
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,000
a change in the shape of the repressor

86
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,759
making it fall off the operator

87
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,919
this now will expose the operator so

88
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,639
that rna polymerase can now bind to the

89
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,719
promoter

90
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,359
and essentially this gene or these genes

91
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,800
now are turned on and these will be made

92
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,959
and it's important for the cell to make

93
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,760
them for the bacteria cell because now

94
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,239
lactose is

95
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,439
available let's give you a couple

96
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,878
scenarios here

97
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,878
we've talked about lactose being

98
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,518
available yes we want to have that gene

99
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,359
strongly expressed in these two

100
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,400
following cases we have lactose not

101
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,959
being available

102
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
so therefore they are repressed they're

103
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,759
pressed for different reasons we in this

104
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,519
case we have high glucose

105
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,359
cell still getting energy here's a lot

106
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,840
of energy available regardless but still

107
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,640
not a lot of lactose or lactose being

108
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,719
unavailable

109
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,399
those genes will not be expressed here

110
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,120
we have high glucose and lactose being

111
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
available

112
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,239
so there will be some we call it low

113
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,840
basal level gene expression

114
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,480
because as i mentioned glucose is

115
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,479
preferred but in the case where we have

116
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,719
low glucose and lactose being available

117
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,039
it's going to be strongly expressed

118
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,639
this is simply the bacteria cell

119
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,479
producing the genes that ultimately will

120
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,759
produce the proteins that are most

121
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,759
efficient for its current conditions

122
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,759
now this is that operon simulation i

123
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,439
give you a link to it right here

124
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,639
another video you can check take a look

125
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,919
at it but i'm kind of go through the

126
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,798
simulation now

127
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,079
so you get an idea of exactly how this

128
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,680
works

129
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,159
okay so now we're here looking at the

130
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,640
simulation we see our legend here

131
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,840
and we have our ability to add lactose

132
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,679
to the situation

133
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,759
so here we have some breaks in our

134
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,438
genetic code so i want to add that

135
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,919
promoter region so that lac

136
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,199
uh promoter region but if we add just a

137
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,158
promoter region with no

138
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,000
gene this is our rna polymerase binding

139
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,519
to that but it can't make the gene

140
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,519
so here now i have the gene when i

141
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,280
attach the gene there and polymerase

142
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,840
goes through now it has that

143
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,359
specific sequence to replicate that gene

144
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,439
will go through the process

145
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,720
of translation to form what this is

146
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,399
going to be is

147
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,160
the repressor so here's our lac z gene

148
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,159
if i insert the gene it's all well and

149
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,840
good now we have a complete genome

150
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,360
however we don't have an area for

151
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,359
polymerase to start

152
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,520
so it's very important that you add the

153
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,960
promoter we also want to add that very

154
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,560
important operator and you'll notice

155
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,319
that operator fits

156
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,240
the repressor here so we're not making

157
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,560
the lacz gene we're not making the

158
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
lactase enzyme why there's no lactose

159
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,280
present

160
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
so if i add some lactose you can see our

161
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,839
disaccharide here

162
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
when this comes through and binds to the

163
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,239
repressor it changes its shape it

164
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,879
removes

165
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,519
that repressor so i add a little more

166
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,600
lactose

167
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,560
now that repressor is removed now we can

168
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,320
make that lac

169
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,319
z gene which is only going to go through

170
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,199
the process of translation

171
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,319
to form our lacz enzyme this enzyme can

172
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,600
go through and break down the

173
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,399
disaccharide

174
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,160
into galactose and glucose now you'll

175
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,359
notice that i haven't added any more

176
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,960
lactose and we've broken down

177
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,240
almost one more piece here we've broken

178
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,000
down all of the lactose that was present

179
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,918
and now the repressor is bound here and

180
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,759
kind of stuck here it's going to prevent

181
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,159
the enzyme from being made it's this

182
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,439
very efficient way for the cell to go

183
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,840
through and

184
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,519
not waste its energy now if this

185
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,959
bacterial cell goes through and whatever

186
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,439
reason comes into an environment that's

187
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,439
very high in lactose see if i flood the

188
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,360
area with lactose

189
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,800
now what we're having is we need a lot

190
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,479
of these enzymes to be made so

191
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,319
all these repressors are being bound

192
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:56,800
their shape has changed they can't bind

193
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,120
here

194
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,000
to prevent the making of that enzyme

195
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
you're now going to see

196
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,720
a lot of enzymes being made and produced

197
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,478
and it's very important those enzymes

198
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,919
are made and produced because we've got

199
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,519
a lot of this

200
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,120
lactose products we have off the charts

201
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,560
amounts of lactose

202
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,478
but going through the process here we

203
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,560
can see the enzymes doing its job

204
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:21,199
multiple times breaking down the

205
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,959
the lactose and those lactase enzymes

206
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,280
doing their job going through

207
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,000
breaking everything down still making

208
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,758
more

209
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
enzymes because again those repressors

210
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,199
are bound they are a different shape

211
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,400
they can't block that gene which is

212
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,720
important for the cell

213
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,318
high degree of lactose being present we

214
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,240
want a lot of those enzymes

215
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,759
present as well that's helping this

216
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,759
breakdown process

217
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,800
and this will continue until we notice

218
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,000
that there is

219
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,918
basically not a lot of lactose remaining

220
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,360
therefore we have no need to produce the

221
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,198
lactase enzyme

222
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,360
uh the repressors will come back through

223
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,360
eventually bind to the repressor

224
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,199
and reduce the amount of enzymes being

225
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,199
made until the

226
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
events change where there will be some

227
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,478
more lactose present you can see now

228
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,680
we're overrun with enzymes but the

229
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,240
repressor is binding

230
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,759
preventing any new ones from being made

231
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,560
however we take this one more step

232
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,439
further

233
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,720
look at lactose in transport we have the

234
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,279
same situation but

235
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,160
here we have the cell membrane so we

236
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,318
have lactose

237
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
outside the cell we have insider cell a

238
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,560
repressor being made

239
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,919
let me add our lacz gene let me add our

240
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,439
promoter like we did

241
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,439
in our operator

242
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,160
operator right now then allow that laxi

243
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,439
gene to be made to see every pressure

244
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,840
being bound

245
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,759
uh now that gene that allowed to be made

246
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,918
they didn't have the proper operator

247
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,120
we have some enzyme here even though

248
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,159
there's lactose present

249
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,319
it is separated by the cell membrane

250
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,080
so there's one more gene here involved

251
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,160
with this operator it's called the lac

252
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:55,598
wise gene what this lacy

253
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,520
gene occurs is allows this kind of inter

254
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,199
membrane protein to be made now you

255
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,918
notice right now it's being blocked

256
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
but these repressors can't bind forever

257
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:03,598
so

258
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,519
eventually it detaches and no one's

259
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,478
going to come in right behind it but now

260
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,478
what's going to happen

261
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,159
is we're now having the lac z gene made

262
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,800
to break down lactose we're also saying

263
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,160
this lac

264
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
y gene made this protein is ultimately

265
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,240
going to go

266
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,840
this green protein it's going to

267
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,800
ultimately go to the cell and allow the

268
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,519
passage

269
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,439
of that lactose from the outside of the

270
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,560
cell to the inside so that enzyme can

271
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,319
work

272
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,079
now you'll notice the same thing i add

273
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,039
the enzyme it's going through it's being

274
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,918
transported now it's being broken down

275
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,639
and we're very efficiently using our

276
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,679
enzymes

277
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,360
if i stop adding the lactose

278
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,879
we have no reason to produce any more of

279
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,120
the laxity or the lactase

280
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,519
enzymes we could see that that repressor

281
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,519
is bound but now it's one more time

282
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,839
changed its conformational shape we're

283
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,519
going to make another round of enzymes

284
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,080
to break down these last bit of

285
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,278
lactose that is present inside the cell

286
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,879
now these got in the cell and those

287
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:59,759
proteins on the outside cell are still

288
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,240
present

289
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,200
if we cause a mutation so for example if

290
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,320
i take the

291
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,640
lac uh i gene and i mutate it and

292
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
basically remove it we're no longer

293
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,919
making any repressors

294
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,360
if we no longer make repressors that's

295
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,958
going to cause some issues

296
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,399
because when these finally degrade the

297
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,039
cell is going to keep making these

298
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,600
proteins

299
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,958
even though there is no lactose present

300
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,399
so this is important for gene

301
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,000
regulation that we don't want the cell

302
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,720
to be wasting energy making all these

303
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,320
proteins

304
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
we want to make sure it's efficient

305
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,080
producing what it needs to

306
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,278
and hopefully this lac operon gives you

307
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,240
kind of that idea

308
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,278
of just how important gene regulation is

309
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,440
and some of the

310
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,200
hopefully a simplified breakdown of the

311
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
complexities of some of the steps

312
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,800
involved

313
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,399
here we have a mutation in the kind of

314
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,559
repressor

315
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,000
protein being made now we have all these

316
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,518
extra enzymes being made when there is

317
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
no lactose so the cell right now is

318
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,159
wasting

319
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
energy we want to make sure we have all

320
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,719
of our genes properly operating

321
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,278
with functional promoters to allow the

322
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,959
cell

323
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:03,120
to be efficient with its energy usage

324
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,719
okay having gone through the simulation

325
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,039
now hopefully that was

326
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,800
helpful for you and if you go through i

327
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,120
got a couple questions here so if you

328
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,439
feel

329
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,639
felt like you understood it uh why do

330
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,240
genes require promoters what's the

331
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,078
purpose of an operator

332
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,959
a couple other questions here i try to

333
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,319
carry through the stimulation that i did

334
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,239
and you've got a couple other questions

335
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,320
here to consider you might want to

336
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,240
pause the video take a look at make sure

337
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,480
you can answer so you can determine

338
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,639
your level of understanding when it

339
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,278
comes to operators in regards to

340
