1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
okay here we look at cellular nuclear

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,839
components and we see a couple cells

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,160
here with well-defined

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,359
nuclei and others that have just or

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,240
chromosomes because they're going

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,558
through the process

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
of cell division well here we're going

8
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,480
to kind of focus on that well-defined

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,240
nucleus to start with because it is the

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,920
command center of the cell that's

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:20,959
separated from the cytoplasm by a

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,439
nuclear envelope

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,118
it consists of a double layer membrane

14
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,719
nuclear pores permit the exchange

15
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:27,599
between the nucleoplasm which is the

16
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,198
interior

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,000
and the cytoplasm which is located on

18
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,399
the exterior of the nucleus

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
now this nucleus contains semi-fluid

20
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,039
nucleoplasms they just said that

21
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,280
interior space

22
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,479
and chromatin consists of dna of genes

23
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
and proteins

24
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,000
this condenses to form chromosomes this

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
is important

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,600
as cells going through the process of

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,320
division those chromosomes are formed

28
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,480
during that

29
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,640
process so we have our dna our kind of

30
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,319
isolated kind of patches and particles

31
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
that are going to be condensed because

32
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,320
every human cell has about six

33
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,000
feet of dna in every cell and it's

34
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,960
ultimately going to be kind of

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,319
condensed down to these chromosomes that

36
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,840
we can recognize

37
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,839
as this densely packed dna the nucleus

38
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
itself has a nuclear envelope and that's

39
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,000
that

40
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,599
lipid bilayer it's two layers here

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,599
and it's a membrane surrounding the

42
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,239
nucleus it also has an inner membrane

43
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,478
coated with

44
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,839
laminate which is a fibrous protein that

45
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,920
helps keep everything

46
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,000
organized that's where the chromatin is

47
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,640
physically attached to

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,078
we have the outer membrane which is kind

49
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,680
of ties in with the endoplasmic

50
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,399
reticulum we have very important

51
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,000
nuclear pores which regulate the

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,400
transport of proteins

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,078
and rna in and out of the nucleus

54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,960
they're pores not holes because they

55
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,839
are a regulated step now the reason why

56
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,839
these cells

57
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
or nucleus have these pores which are

58
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
very important

59
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,118
um they're large protein complexes and

60
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,640
they do allow for necessary proteins to

61
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,478
enter the nucleus

62
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
from the cytoplasm because they have

63
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,879
special sequences that indicate that

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,359
they belong

65
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,000
in the nucleus a lot of viruses and

66
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,840
other

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,599
things that want to take over the cell

68
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,118
want to enter or find a way to get into

69
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,319
the nucleus so these pores are kind of

70
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,038
that regulation

71
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,878
step now small molecules such as ions

72
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,639
freely pass and diffuse into and out of

73
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,318
the nucleus but those larger ones

74
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,238
have to go through the pores and those

75
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,878
are regulated

76
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,719
in a nucleus we have a small darkened

77
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,878
region here the nucleolus

78
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,560
and that's composed mainly of rrna which

79
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,318
is ribosomal rna

80
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,598
there's at least one sometimes many can

81
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,159
be seen depending what cell you're

82
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,479
looking at

83
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,799
this is the site of transcription the

84
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,598
site of rrna where those ribosomes are

85
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,640
synthesized

86
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,399
and processed looking at a kind of

87
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,279
cartoon image here we have that

88
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,039
nucleolus

89
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,800
it can cause some of the chromatin and

90
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,479
ribosomal subunits

91
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,120
region of intensive ribosomal or rna

92
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,959
synthesis that's that darkened region in

93
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,640
that nuclear envelope that's the surface

94
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,000
of the nucleus bounded by two

95
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,079
phospholipid bilayers

96
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,680
it's a double membrane with pores and

97
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,680
that nucleoplasm which is that inside

98
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,120
that semi-fluid medium inside the

99
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,200
nucleus

100
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
those chromosomes the dna of eukaryotes

101
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,598
is divided into linear chromosomes

102
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,639
and they exist as strands of chromatin

103
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,759
except during cell

104
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,318
division histones these little

105
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,359
blue spheres here are associated with

106
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,679
packaging

107
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
proteins and they help the dna wrap

108
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,640
around them

109
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,238
so they can help increase the density

110
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,079
and compact that dna

111
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
without it getting tangled
