1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,080
going to go over some drying area

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,440
conditions for your cannabis plants

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,800
as well as show you some actual drying

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,558
conditions now we'll be a little loud

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,960
with the fan but it just goes to show

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,039
you

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,240
the importance of air circulation but

9
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,160
it's more than that need to be aware of

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,320
your temperature as well as humidity

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,039
all that you'll learn about here in this

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,039
video lecture

13
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:31,278
[Music]

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,359
all right let's get into drying area

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,920
conditions for cannabis and we see a

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,119
wonderful dry room right here with the

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
plants being cut and hung

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,039
on this on the strings allow good air

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
circulation here we see

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,039
the humidity as well as the temperature

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,920
being carefully monitored

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,520
and within the acceptable range now

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,320
those key environmental conditions to

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
monitor are

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,238
air circulation when i have good air

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,719
movement temperature as we saw

27
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,640
moisture content or humidity light as

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
well as keeping the conditions

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,079
consistent and i say light we're looking

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,759
at minimal amount of light some of the

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,920
pictures will have the lights on

32
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,158
but they're at a very low duration of

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
time and a very low intensity

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,439
so let's start with the all-important

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,959
air circulation and this is important

36
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,000
while growing the plants

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,519
and also while drying the plants and

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,438
maintaining good air circulation is

39
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,798
critical to any dry room as i said

40
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,719
later in this video you'll see me an

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,080
actual drying area and you'll hear a lot

42
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,079
of background noise because a lot of

43
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,840
fans running this includes the room

44
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,879
itself but growers also need to be

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,320
mindful of the

46
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,078
micro environment in the immediate

47
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,438
vicinity of the buds a lot of times we

48
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,239
think about air circulation thing of the

49
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,879
whole room

50
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,478
that's important but also from a plant

51
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,399
or a bud to bud to bud

52
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,478
standpoint as well there does not need

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,200
to be direct and consistent airflow on

54
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,759
the buds

55
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
but a general air movement of air around

56
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,280
the buds is what's important

57
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,200
don't need the concept of a fan blowing

58
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,320
on them but have some

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,320
area of air movement constantly and we

60
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,478
think about it on a horizontal basis as

61
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:01,519
well as a vertical basis here

62
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,879
within the dry room now temperature so

63
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,399
we want to be monitoring our temperature

64
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,118
general range 60 to 70 degrees

65
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,640
fahrenheit

66
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,560
however the true target should be as

67
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,199
close to 60 degrees fahrenheit as

68
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
possible

69
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,639
with really 58 to 62 being the ideal

70
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
range

71
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,439
because we really want to kind of dial

72
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,719
in and have the least amount of

73
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,560
variability

74
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,719
so really what's the 60 to 70 is the

75
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,199
accepted range 58 to 62 is the ideal

76
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,359
range

77
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,639
and kind of 60 is kind of like the

78
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,480
target number there

79
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,238
and that could be you're drawing buds on

80
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,399
a rack or you're drying buds here where

81
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,239
we're hanging them upside down

82
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
then we get to moisture content which is

83
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,159
basically the humidity

84
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,640
and this is the most recognized of both

85
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,840
the air as well as the buds themselves

86
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,359
remember the moisture in the buds

87
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,400
themselves will be changing starting out

88
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400
at the greatest amount and then

89
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,280
decreasing as the drying process

90
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,039
continues

91
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,959
this will put a strain on your humidity

92
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,079
regulating system in the early part of

93
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,479
the drying process

94
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
but this is critical to having a quality

95
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,199
end product

96
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
so kind of when you put all the initial

97
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,560
plants in the area your dehumidifier

98
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
will probably be under the greatest

99
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
stress so keep an eye on it keep

100
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,479
changing

101
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,759
taking the water out there and make sure

102
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,000
it can handle that

103
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,479
initial input of plants the general

104
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,158
target for humidity is between 55 and 65

105
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,639
percent however again 60

106
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,359
is the ideal with 58 to 62 percent

107
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,839
humidity

108
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
being the range you should be aiming for

109
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,080
and put this kind of image here looking

110
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,679
at relative humidity

111
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
as you can see it does change from other

112
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
plants to clones to young plants to

113
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,159
flowering and then drying there

114
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,679
they're recommending 45 to 55. there's

115
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,959
going to be some

116
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,799
you know argument as far as what the

117
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,878
exact number is typically

118
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,040
if you aim for 60 it's a pretty good

119
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,439
target range there

120
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,359
light that i had mentioned so canvas

121
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,799
should be dried in a dark environment

122
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,640
but this does not mean

123
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,000
any light exposure will ruin the crop

124
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,919
you can go in the room just keep the

125
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,598
time the lights on minimal and limit the

126
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,598
intensity of the light

127
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,878
so we could see here you want to go on

128
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,399
and check on anything get something out

129
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,518
of the room perfectly fine

130
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,599
don't think that you can't have

131
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,519
absolutely no light but again keep the

132
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,479
duration of time as short as possible

133
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
and make sure you're turning on the

134
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,598
least amount of lights also keep that

135
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,920
intensity

136
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,079
low it'll prevent the degradation of any

137
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,079
compounds within the cannabis buds so we

138
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
want to keep our conditions consistent

139
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,400
so

140
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,399
even though the moisture levels in the

141
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,680
buds will be reduced by about 80 percent

142
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,760
the goal is to keep the dry room

143
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,798
environment as consistent as possible

144
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,000
despite the change in the buds typically

145
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,399
this will take about seven

146
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to ten days or so and during that time

147
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,120
or whatever duration of time you have

148
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,600
you want to ensure that the air

149
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,360
circulation is even inconsistent

150
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
temperature target should be around 60

151
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,560
degrees fahrenheit

152
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,320
moisture content should be around 60

153
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
percent and light should be

154
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,000
minimal both in intensity as well as

155
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,880
duration want to keep everything nice

156
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,478
and consistent kind of like the

157
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,439
paralysis of the rail tracks throughout

158
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,839
the entire

159
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,879
drying conditions now let's go out and

160
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,359
let's take a look at some

161
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,439
cannabis plants actively drying sorry in

162
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,040
advance for the fan noise but that just

163
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,439
shows the importance of having air

164
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,319
circulation in the fairly large areas

165
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,959
that you're going to see

166
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,240
the cannabis plants hit drying so when

167
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,038
we're looking at that kind of

168
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,800
end of the season harvest drying inspect

169
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,159
here's some of those main stocks all

170
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,240
been caught

171
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,120
uh all been kind of harvested from we

172
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,000
got a couple a little more to go here

173
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
we can kind of see the end result see

174
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,600
some of the

175
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,360
pre-manicured buds there and then we see

176
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,919
some of the areas being dried here

177
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,038
behind me you might hear some fans

178
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:21,680
running and that's because you're trying

179
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,399
to maintain

180
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,400
good air circulation for all these buds

181
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
okay so here we're looking at some buds

182
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
drying on the on the

183
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,160
screen here we see some hanging upside

184
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
down

185
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
on this side this is kind of that kind

186
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,439
of ideal harvest

187
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,079
where we're kind of hanging everything

188
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,680
down we have some leaves here we want to

189
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,079
be taking some of those off to again

190
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,319
help

191
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,560
improve our air circulation there's a

192
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,159
lot of fans running i can feel a breeze

193
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,360
in this area and that's a good thing

194
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
i want to make sure everything that's

195
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,479
even as possible the advantage of using

196
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
this kind of like

197
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,159
deer netting screen is it allows

198
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,199
everything to hang naturally

199
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,880
and not to develop flat spots on the

200
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,120
lower end here we do have a screen on

201
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,959
the floor which can also be utilized

202
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,639
uh the key part again is just keeping

203
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,719
those consistent conditions

204
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,079
reducing that humidity over time and

205
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,800
maintaining nice

206
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,159
good air circulation so here we can kind

207
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
of see all the different methods in

208
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,360
place at once

209
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,520
you see the kind of the traditional

210
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,879
upside down hanging to dry

211
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,478
we see this kind of screen hung

212
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,240
in a vertical manner and we have the

213
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,199
horizontal screen down here

214
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,038
at the bottom so it's important to keep

215
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,560
in mind that this drying process can

216
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,478
take many forms

217
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
here we just see a couple of them here

218
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,079
and all of their own

219
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,319
advantages this one allows the buds to

220
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,478
dry so that there's no flat spots

221
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,600
this one on the horizontal can be

222
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,120
stacked

223
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
and be very easy to set up you don't

224
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,120
have the manual labor of hanging them

225
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,120
and then we have the upside down plans

226
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
for the volume you'll also notice in

227
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
this room that the lighting for the most

228
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,000
part is relatively dim

229
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,840
because we don't need large amounts of

230
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,279
bright lights during this process

231
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,119
but we do want to be coming in here and

232
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,079
inspecting to make sure everything is

233
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,160
running well

234
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,758
you may also notice the floor is covered

235
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,919
with the tarp material

236
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,439
so again cleanliness is important

237
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,879
consistency of conditions

238
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,839
and as a grower you need to be

239
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,839
monitoring this

240
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,280
you
