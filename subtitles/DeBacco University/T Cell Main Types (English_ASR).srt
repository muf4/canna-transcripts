1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,589
here we're gonna specifically look at

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:07,889
the main types of T cells specifically

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,359
the four main types of T cells so the

4
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:11,189
four main types we have the first one

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,160
here which is the helper T cells which

6
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:16,829
initiate the immune response they are

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,690
the ones that authorized the attack so

8
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:20,070
often helper T cells can be considered

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,990
like generals of the immune system

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,439
because they call up troops of the B

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:27,778
cells cytotoxic T cells and other helper

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,329
cells to go into battle against invading

13
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,368
pathogens as we see in this image here

14
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,058
so our helper T cells where are they

15
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,700
located

16
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:38,718
alright here they're the ones kind of

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:43,379
initiating and calling in other T cells

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,899
and B cells to initiate this response of

19
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:49,019
the immune system so helper T cells is

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,120
one type another type is called the

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,449
cytotoxic T cells but I mentioned before

22
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,429
they lyse virus infected cells they have

23
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:59,488
the license to kill here that kind of a

24
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,600
secret agent so R cytotoxic T cells are

25
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:04,018
the ones that are actually going through

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,670
and destroying the cells lice in those

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,670
cells we see here our red blood cell

28
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,570
being lysed being broken apart they're

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,250
releasing proteins think of them as like

30
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:17,579
little missiles to help break down that

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,459
particular cell the third type is called

32
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,209
the memory T cells so they provide a

33
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,250
quick response

34
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,798
unreal they're kind of the ones keeping

35
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,259
watch so initially we have our initial

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,229
exposure no memory T cells with our

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,450
primary immune response low affinity for

38
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:35,849
antibodies but upon a second exposure

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,710
see how it rises a lot higher than much

40
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:40,140
quicker concentration of antibodies

41
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:41,819
that's because of our memory T cells

42
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,189
because they're providing that quick

43
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,048
response upon re-exposure they're

44
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,239
remembering hey I've seen this before

45
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,970
and then initiate much greater

46
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,750
concentration of antibodies the fourth

47
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,310
type are the suppressor T cells so these

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,840
terminate the immune response now the

49
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,700
submission initially might sound

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,009
counterintuitive what everyone's

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,409
suppressor T cells they're the ones that

52
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,019
basically declare victory and they say

53
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,849
it's time to take a rest they're kind of

54
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,469
ones that say stop wasting time

55
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,869
stop devoting energy to this we've

56
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,919
cleared up the problem you can stop now

57
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,560
kind of that

58
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,229
kind of regulate or shut down other

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,080
system here so yes at times we do want

60
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:24,269
these to be active and cleaning up our

61
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,040
body ridding it of potential invaders

62
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,170
but we also need a way to kind of stop

63
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,239
that so this body is not wasting energy

64
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:32,789
over producing these particular cells

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,780
and the T suppressor cells are

66
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:35,780
responsible for that
