1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,259
okay so here are we looking at the

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,669
vegetative growth cycle of cannabis keep

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,220
in mind that vegetative state is

4
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:10,530
focusing mainly on the leaves here and

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,000
that ultimately producing any flowers

6
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:14,669
but producing a plant with good

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,259
structure and I can carry itself well

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:18,420
into the flowering state which follows

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,250
the vegetative state so first off

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,250
vegetative growth of cannabis excluding

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,109
root Alice if it receives 16 plus hours

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,179
of a continuous light they'll remain in

13
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,039
the vegetative growth phase I deleted

14
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,050
the more light the plant receives the

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,520
greater the growth will be and this is

16
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,890
again to some extent because there can

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,590
be burning that occurs for example if we

18
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,230
look at nature ferns grow below tall

19
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,390
trees and these ferns need diffused and

20
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,279
reduced light so they're best suited for

21
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,570
that the trees however they're growing

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,579
taller and stretching so that they're

23
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,219
able to capture more of the light their

24
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,009
leaves now growing leaves welcome to our

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,500
cannabis leaves here the goal is to

26
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:58,140
provide not only quality leaves but also

27
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,730
while the structure to the plant this is

28
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,250
setting the plant up for the flowering

29
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,709
stage it's going to come after this

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,810
vegetative state so we considered one of

31
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,629
the most important phases of a life

32
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,400
cycle because you can determine the

33
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,560
yield at the end so even though there's

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,090
no flowers produced if you treat plants

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,310
poorly or set them up early in a

36
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,020
vegetative state they will have poor

37
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,439
flower production because they're not

38
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:24,959
well tuned or prepared well to go under

39
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,819
the stresses of producing flowers this

40
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,978
is why this is often considered one the

41
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,309
most important phases even though it is

42
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:36,179
not producing any end flowers in order

43
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,040
to maintain these 16 plus or 18 plus

44
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,720
hours of light you do have a quality

45
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,880
timer you need to keep it in the

46
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,158
vegetative growth phase as long as you

47
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,899
see desirable this is where timers could

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,700
become important if you're looking at a

49
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,170
timer and you set it to 16 to 18 hours

50
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,478
of light and keep it at that phase you

51
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,519
know change it your plants will continue

52
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,859
to grow under the vegetative growth

53
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,810
phase of the life cycle as soon as you

54
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,549
go through and flip the timers that can

55
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,930
cause them to go into flower or if you

56
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,820
have a timer that malfunctions

57
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,740
that's something ability to keep in iOS

58
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:05,279
please that can also cause them to go

59
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,189
into flower

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,719
prematurely while flowering during the

61
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:11,878
vegetative cycles so under normal

62
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,830
growing conditions after about 4 to 6 or

63
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,120
so weeks as a vegetative growth

64
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,580
plants will start to exhibit something

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,170
called pre flowers it's a male plant it

66
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,910
will produce flowers sooner than a

67
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,829
female plant this is what the male

68
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,319
flowers look like these are the ones you

69
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,240
want to call sooner to prevent any

70
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,609
potential unlight cross-pollination with

71
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,770
a female is where the female pre flower

72
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,510
will look like right here so when we're

73
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,980
looking at the vegetative state yes

74
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:36,659
we're looking at plant structure yes

75
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,629
we're looking at leaves but there will

76
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,669
be that the initial form of flowers

77
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:43,530
develop in these are pre flowers these

78
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,359
are not mature in any way these are

79
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,159
showing you though or demonstrating the

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,800
gender of the plant that you're looking

81
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,990
at and if you either have female flowers

82
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,550
pre female flowers or pre males ours

83
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,020
as I said the male flowers typically

84
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,219
show up sooner because they're looking

85
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,890
to produce pollen to pollinate the

86
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,539
female vegetative to flowering switch

87
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,849
once pre flowers are observed changing

88
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:04,949
these plants photo periods to an evening

89
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,930
12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark

90
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:08,459
will induce the flowering stage if you

91
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,020
keep him under their whole puzzle I'll

92
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,300
continue to grow and expand a little bit

93
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,140
during the flowering stage and get the

94
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:19,170
buds that you've desire keep in mind

95
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:20,699
that flipping these plants is advised

96
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,439
after you start to see the pre flowers

97
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,719
it's kind of like your indication that

98
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,560
those plants can make the switch over to

99
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,560
the flowering room
