1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,000
nitrogen is a very important fertilizer

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,919
for cannabis plants

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,519
but can be a little confusing here in

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,839
debaco university

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:10,879
hope to through this video clarify some

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,160
of the confusion

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,920
and get you to understand about some of

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,920
the options that exist

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,039
[Music]

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,480
all right let's look at nitrogen

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,519
fertilizer options for cannabis

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,519
production

13
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,559
so first off the effects of nitrogen

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:31,198
fertilizer rate

15
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,558
and timing so nitrogen can be found in

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,800
either organic

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,159
or inorganic forms in the soil organic

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,320
forms of nitrogen are found when the

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,398
plant and animal material decomposes

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,920
and releases proteins and amino acids

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,200
back into the soil as part of the

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,960
nitrogen cycle

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,520
when organic materials are broken down

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,280
by bacteria they form inorganic nitrogen

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,640
as ammonia so the process called

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,198
ammonification

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,079
inorganic nitrogen includes nitrates

28
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,280
ammonium

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,640
and d-nitrogen gas as well european

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,640
research had indicated and hemp

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,679
cultivars do not need as much nitrogen

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,119
compared to wheat

33
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,799
so there's a nice little comparison

34
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,798
there if you look at wheat research

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
may be able to use that as a theoretical

36
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,799
maximum here

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
if you'd be going to be growing cannabis

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,080
so research from canada hemp response to

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,840
nitrogen fertilizer

40
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,359
so research in canada demonstrated that

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
hemp responded to nitrogen

42
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,640
up to about 120 kilograms of nitrogen

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,799
per hectare

44
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
which equates to about 110 pounds of

45
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,159
nitrogen per acre

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,920
when soils were deficient by increasing

47
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
speed and biomass yield

48
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,560
and again research stated here research

49
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,840
in saskatchewan showed that positive

50
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
response to fertilizer

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,640
with nitrogen rates up to 150 kilograms

52
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,320
of nitrogen per hectare or 130 pounds of

53
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,759
nitrogen per acre being optimal

54
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,679
so you can see that there is a little

55
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,519
bit of kind of

56
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,680
uh walking of those numbers a little bit

57
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,679
of a variability in those numbers

58
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,399
in quebec they found 180 pounds

59
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,399
to the acre or 200 kilograms of nitrogen

60
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,920
showed positive response with no plateau

61
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,960
observed so again something to take into

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,478
consideration

63
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,679
so what's the general summary of all

64
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,799
this nitrogen rates of 120 kilograms

65
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,599
of nitrogen per hectare or 110 pounds

66
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,000
of nitrogen per acre to 200 kilograms of

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,919
nitrogen perector or 180 pounds

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,039
of nitrogen per acre should be the

69
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,359
target range

70
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,239
ideal target should be around 150

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,640
kilograms

72
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,280
per hectare or 130 pounds of nitrogen

73
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,119
per acre

74
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
this gives you a good starting point so

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,920
you're not over fertilizing but also not

76
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,360
starving your plants for nitrogen now

77
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,799
why is nitrogen so difficult well

78
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,480
nitrogen is so difficult because it does

79
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,360
a lot of changes it goes through a lot

80
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,959
of kind of

81
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,840
transformations if you will so all major

82
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,759
soil

83
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,000
nitrogen transformations are immediate

84
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,518
by various soil microorganisms

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,598
also the fate of any fertilizer and

86
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,519
agent source is subject to the following

87
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,359
we want to consider mineralization this

88
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,000
is conversion of organic nitrogen to

89
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,400
inorganic

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,919
nitrogen by microorganisms the

91
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,439
mineralization effect here we can see

92
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,958
that portion right here

93
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,639
in this kind of diagram trying to

94
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
demonstrate this visually

95
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,919
nitrification is the conversion of

96
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,639
ammonium to nitrogen into

97
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,280
nitrate so we have that nitrification

98
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,759
phase

99
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,360
that can also be occurring then we also

100
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,439
have denitrification which is the

101
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,879
conversion nitrate into nitrogen gas

102
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,079
in this case it becomes lost to the

103
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,359
atmosphere so here's an example of

104
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,040
denitrification

105
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,800
bringing nitrogen gas and being kind of

106
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,639
lost out to the atmosphere

107
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,840
same thing we have uh volatilization of

108
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,318
ammonia

109
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,878
loss of ammonia nitrogen as a gas as

110
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,798
well

111
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,959
this volatilization that does occur

112
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,640
leaching which is caused by over

113
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,080
irrigation especially in sandy soils

114
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,279
causing that water to be leached out

115
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,280
through

116
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,199
immobilization is where we have the

117
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,479
conversion of inorganic nitrogen to

118
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,399
organic forms

119
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,639
typically then uptake by plants and

120
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,239
microbes and immune fixation on certain

121
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,919
types of clay soils

122
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,759
so you can see that there's a lot going

123
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,958
on here's our fertilizer inputs

124
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,639
here's our potential leaching in the

125
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,319
groundwater our nitrifications our

126
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,878
mineralization or dentification there's

127
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,479
a lot going on with nitrogen

128
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,318
so nitrogen conversions impact at the

129
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,719
root zone ph

130
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,079
so plants uptake ammonium and other

131
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,039
positively charged

132
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,519
cations by releasing one hydrogen ion h

133
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,438
plus

134
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
into the medium solution for each

135
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,479
ammonium ion to be absorbed so it's kind

136
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,920
of this release and uptake that's

137
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,719
occurring

138
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,280
now over time the ammonia nitrogen

139
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,600
uptake

140
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,040
increases hydrogen ion concentration

141
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,560
thereby lowering

142
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,319
the growing medium ph keep in mind ph

143
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
is the measure of the hydrogen ion

144
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:30,240
concentrations and as your hydrogen ions

145
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,639
increase in number your ph becomes lower

146
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,720
so a ph of 2 has a really high amount of

147
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,600
hydrogen ions and a ph of 8

148
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,440
has a much lower amount of hydrogen ions

149
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
the uptake of negative negatively

150
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,199
charged anions such as nitrate is most

151
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,319
often accomplished

152
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,840
by releasing hydroxide ions or oh

153
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,000
in this growing medium solution

154
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,959
hydroxide and hydrogen ions combine to

155
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,879
form water

156
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,560
so if you look at these independently

157
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,279
they look positive negative

158
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,800
well h2o is two hydrogens and one oxygen

159
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,559
it'll be a neutral charge

160
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,919
over time the reaction of hydroxide and

161
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,240
hydrogen ions

162
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,839
decreases hydrogen ion concentration and

163
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,759
increases the median ph

164
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,038
so again just an important consideration

165
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,560
to be making that

166
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:11,759
right near the root zone your ph is

167
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,319
going to be fluctuating which could

168
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,038
affect

169
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,079
nutrient uptake so impact on different

170
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,719
percent of ammonium

171
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,639
on the root zone ph well rose plants

172
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,000
were shown grown in hydroponically

173
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,840
in a nutrient solution containing

174
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,439
different percentage of ammonium here's

175
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,599
a days after fertilization

176
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,639
and here's the ph the effects are much

177
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,240
more dramatic

178
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,720
than what would occur in a commercial

179
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,720
growing medium as it's somewhat buffered

180
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,199
due to the chemical properties added by

181
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,759
limestone this was shown in

182
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,720
um in a purely hydroponic situation and

183
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,759
we could see that

184
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,520
as the percentage increase of nitrogen

185
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,639
in the form of ammonium

186
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,918
we see a steep drop in ph and sometimes

187
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,120
it stays down there and sometimes it

188
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,120
does bounce back

189
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,560
so there's a certain kind of theoretical

190
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,680
threshold amount that's going to

191
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,160
maintain that very acidic environment

192
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,000
so organic matter and nitrogen well soil

193
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,919
organic matter will mineralize about 20

194
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
to 40 pounds of nitrogen per acre per

195
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,719
year

196
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,400
95 or more of the total nitrogen in

197
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,280
surface soils is present

198
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,560
as organic nitrogen so keep that in mind

199
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,519
under normal growing conditions when

200
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,079
soils are warm

201
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,198
moist and well aerated model nitrogen

202
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,079
ammonium plus

203
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,520
ammonia converts to nitrate into about

204
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,918
two to three weeks

205
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,758
making the nitrate in the most abundant

206
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,439
inorganic form of nitrogen

207
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,879
so we're seeing this kind of transition

208
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,560
between mineralization

209
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,240
immobilization and this kind of circle

210
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,519
that goes around but then we also have

211
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,519
this nitrification where we're having

212
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,000
that conversion here

213
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,959
that is also occurring so again soil

214
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,199
organic matter

215
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,079
great thing to have but it is a key

216
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,319
component

217
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,399
within this nitrogen cycle that's

218
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
occurring in the soils

219
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,439
now there's two forms of our nitrogen

220
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,519
there's chemical

221
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,719
nitrogen fertilizer options and there's

222
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,839
also going to be organic forms which

223
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
i'll talk about next

224
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,879
but your chemical nitrogen forms the

225
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,639
advantage of these in general are

226
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,879
quickly available to the plant

227
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,240
and they contains known and defined

228
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,000
amounts of nitrogen that makes

229
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,879
applications of these

230
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,839
very easy and precise the disadvantages

231
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,759
they can have short

232
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,959
residual times requiring repeated

233
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,560
applications

234
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,719
if you're wondering what um fertilizer

235
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,280
would classify as this category

236
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,400
urea ammonium ammonium nitrate and

237
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,638
calcium nitrate are

238
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,560
examples of chemical nitrogen fertilizer

239
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,478
options that would fall into these

240
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,839
advantages as well as these

241
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,359
disadvantages

242
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,439
however if you're considering organic

243
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,879
forms why would someone consider organic

244
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,839
farms well they're often a free source

245
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,038
of nitrogen

246
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,198
that's why a lot of growers consider

247
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,959
using them the material can also have

248
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,478
other soil property benefits

249
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,399
however the disadvantage of using

250
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,000
organic fertilizer for nitrogen

251
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,439
is it can come with other nutrients that

252
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,279
may not be needed so if you're

253
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,560
fertilizing or only need nitrogen you're

254
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,519
adding these nutrients that contain

255
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,038
other forms

256
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,279
you could reach above optimum or

257
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,240
potentially toxic levels

258
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,918
of other nutrients now pure organic

259
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,800
nitrogen fertilized options would be

260
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,878
blood meal however fish and manure while

261
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,038
they contain high amounts of nitrogen

262
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,639
they also contain other nutrients as

263
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,918
well so be mindful if you're adding

264
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,199
these for nitrogen

265
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,240
you're also going to be adding a lot of

266
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,759
phosphorus and potassium as well

267
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,598
so the organic versus synthetic

268
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,720
fertilizers well here's our organic

269
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,159
we're feeding the soil

270
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,000
synthetics are feeding the plants more

271
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
of a direct line to the plants

272
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,199
organics do have a couple intermediate

273
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,478
steps however

274
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,478
what i want you to realize is no matter

275
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,120
what fertilizer fertilizer option you

276
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,038
choose

277
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,560
they're both ideally being updated by

278
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,000
the plant they do require

279
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,839
maybe a little different timing a little

280
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,519
bit more expertise by the grower to kind

281
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,759
of dial both of these in

282
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,278
but in the end result ideally to the

283
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,319
plant the nitrogen

284
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,759
should be the same so again don't favor

285
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,919
one or the other

286
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,519
just because you're want to be you know

287
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,799
organic you think that's 100 better and

288
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,399
better for the plants

289
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,399
synthetics may have their place

290
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,080
particularly early on when these soil

291
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,519
microorganisms might be a little slower

292
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
to get going in the early part of the

293
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,278
season

294
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,680
when your plants might be showing

295
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,360
nitrogen deficiency so be aware of both

296
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,879
options and utilize both

297
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,759
when they best fit your growing

298
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,759
situation
