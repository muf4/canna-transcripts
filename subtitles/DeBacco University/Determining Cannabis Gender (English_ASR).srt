1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,589
okay I'm gonna go over two ways that you

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,480
can determine cannabis plants and gender

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,830
this respite visually looking at them

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,620
you can't tell whether it's male or

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,789
female so that can be an issue when

6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:14,669
you're looking at mainly

7
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,079
I wanting to produce female all plants

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,379
for the buds and cannabinoids that they

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,509
can produce for you so this should only

10
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,189
be needed if you're starting from seed

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,900
if you're going to go through the labor

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,420
and equipment of an dis intensive

13
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,038
process of cloning propagating be sure

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,740
you know the gender of your plant ahead

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,239
of time males should only be cloned by

16
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,670
breeders who want to repeat a very

17
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,828
specific cross otherwise only female

18
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,660
plants should be cloned so after you go

19
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,460
through and kind of grow all your little

20
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,139
seedlings this is where you're trying to

21
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,390
determine whether these are male plants

22
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,549
or female plants from an early stage

23
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,960
then once you have a known female you

24
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,299
can use that and repeat this process

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,489
with that known gender that you're

26
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,558
dealing with so the most efficient

27
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,570
method would be something called PCR

28
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:58,468
this is what large-scale operations are

29
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,780
using it's called polymerase chain

30
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,609
reaction or that so it's short for to

31
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,588
take technique used to identify the

32
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,659
gender of plans and it can be done as

33
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:08,849
early as about them around the for truth

34
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,609
leave it stage what's great about this

35
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:14,429
method is only a very small sample of a

36
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:18,239
leaf sample is needed let me take a hole

37
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,700
punch and then you add add it to the PCR

38
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,728
and what PCR basically does is multiply

39
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,600
a and you're looking at using this to

40
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:29,578
determine the gender of the plant this

41
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,039
can allow for very early culling of

42
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:33,658
males and reduce the time wasted on non

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,670
target plants and virtually eliminate

44
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,490
the chance that pollen in the grow

45
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,290
facility from a plant that's a male that

46
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:43,379
could cross contaminate in most cases

47
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,360
female plants however that's a little

48
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,459
cost prohibitive so something that's a

49
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,920
little bit easier to do and scales down

50
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,419
a small-scale operation is to simply

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,780
grow a plant and this does take longer

52
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,478
and take a cutting of that plant they

53
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,430
take a small branch cutting and put it

54
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:00,959
in a cloner and put it in under a

55
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,570
flowering photo period

56
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,819
this will help induce flowering which

57
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,589
all I'd to clearly identify that plant

58
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,508
is male or female

59
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,759
now even if the plants get a little

60
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,799
stressed that's okay you're just looking

61
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,759
at getting them to produce flowers

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,340
now what makes this method work which is

63
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,739
can be a problem with some growers is to

64
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,569
keep good records you want to make sure

65
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,340
that you have all these plants labeled

66
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,259
you know which one it is you know what

67
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,569
parent it came from so if you do

68
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,569
identify one is male you are calling out

69
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,909
the proper plant and not having a

70
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:38,569
miscommunication on the records there on

71
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:41,969
some of these cloners do have a nice

72
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,919
abc123 system but I suggest kind of in

73
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,229
some way tagging the actual plant with

74
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,239
some sort of color tag or a little label

75
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:51,539
just to give you that extra redundancy

76
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,310
so that you're allowed to keep the good

77
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,389
plants and cull out the males without

78
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,390
making any mistakes
