1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,520
if you're considering cmh lighting

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,839
options

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,878
for your cannabis production this video

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,960
should prove helpful

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,638
in providing you some explanations so

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:17,920
you better understand

7
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:17,919
ceramic metal halide lights

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,399
welcome to this tobacco university video

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
we're going to go over cmh lighting

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,598
options

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,199
for the greater understanding of these

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,480
so first off they've increased in

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,320
popularity

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,399
so the use of ceramic metal halide

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,000
lights or cmh and light emitting

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,439
ceramics lec grow lights are increasing

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,079
in usage in both commercial

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,280
and hobby grower settings these lights

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,200
are typically 10

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,960
or greater energy efficient and provide

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
the same par or watts

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,239
as traditional metal halides or high

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,960
pressure sodium grow lights with less

24
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,079
heat

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
these are part of the reasons why

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,079
they're increasing in popularity

27
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,078
now the spectrum they produced but the

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,558
quality of lights and that they're

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,399
able to have and the options growers

30
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,399
have for bulbs

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
now the spectrum and wattages so the

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,040
spectrum that they're producing

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,040
is quite advantageous so

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
both of these lights emit traditional

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
par measured spectrum in addition to

36
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,280
infrared

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,400
and also uv spectrums this full spectrum

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,560
can make a visual plant diagnosis

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,880
easier for growers to their high color

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,519
rendering index or cri

41
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,399
the most common cmh grow lights are the

42
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,280
315 watt grow lights and the 630 watt

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,799
grow lights

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,040
now i mentioned this color rendering

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
index here we see an apple this would be

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,240
kind of 100

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,680
and true color rendering and we could

48
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,280
see as we decrease that

49
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
how it starts to look a little off a

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
little not quite as red not quite as

51
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,719
great contrast

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,158
this is very important for growers that

53
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,200
are looking at diagnosing or catching

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,759
problems early

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,118
a higher cri will make it much easier to

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,599
spot potential problems

57
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,359
earlier when it's easier to correct them

58
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,199
now as you mentioned those 315 and those

59
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,359
630 watt options

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
are commonly used their recommended

61
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,078
coverage area for each is as follows

62
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,159
for a 315 you'll get a 4x4 veg room or

63
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,478
3x3 in a flower room

64
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,199
if you're using the larger kind of dual

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
bulb

66
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,919
630 watt it would be a five by five

67
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,080
bedroom coverage area or four by four

68
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,119
flower room coverage area

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
now the cmh bulbs so quality cmh bulbs

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,520
will last for about 20

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,280
000 hours and still retain about 80 or

72
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
more of their initial

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
output in addition more specific

74
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,719
spectrum options are being offered by

75
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,239
manufacturers simply do the increase in

76
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,479
popularity of the ballast

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,080
to allow growers to simply change bulbs

78
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,518
and not necessarily the fixtures

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
as their plants progress through the

80
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,800
growing cycle and again i'm not

81
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,840
sponsored by them

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,519
but these phillips master color bulbs

83
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,200
highly regarded you pay for them they

84
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,680
are tend to be on the more expensive

85
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,679
side

86
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,319
but definitely well worth it if you're

87
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,200
looking at the ultimate cmh bulb

88
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,759
now cmh for canvas in specific compounds

89
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,839
so

90
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,000
some bulbs available will have increase

91
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
in the uv light or far red spectrums

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,439
which can help increase the production

93
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,719
of certain compounds to help boost the

94
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,439
overall quality

95
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,800
and final cannabis product these bulbs

96
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,039
can be used at the very end of the grow

97
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,879
cycle to maximize plant productivity

98
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,158
if you're really looking at maximizing

99
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,239
your potential harvest

100
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,560
or particular compounds produced these

101
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,519
may be worth investigating

102
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,799
and utilizing as part of your in your

103
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,719
cmh ballast

104
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,480
to help make sure your yield and your

105
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,479
quality is as high as possible
