00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,839
here in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,839
i'm going to go over testing chemist

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,918
plant material from mycotoxins

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,080
so you can be a better and informed

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,320
consumer as to just what these are

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,280
and why they are of concern and should

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,920
be tested for

8
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,919
on any analytical report

9
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:25,198
[Music]

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,198
all right let's go over testing cannabis

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,560
plant material for mycotoxins

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,240
well as always here's the research

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,839
article that the summary

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,679
will be provided for if you want to

15
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,200
learn more about some of the details

16
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,719
you're welcome to take a look at this

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,520
for yourself so mycotoxins come

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,439
from mold they are toxic secondary

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,640
metabolites of mold that can proliferate

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,640
in the same environment that is

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,280
supportive for cannabis growth

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,759
mycotoxins are known risk within the

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,160
food

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,000
safety industry in general they are a

25
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,238
concern in cannabis plants because of

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,558
the suspected carcinogens causing acute

27
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,399
and chronic toxicity however those

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,280
mycotoxins aren't limited just to

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,840
cannabis

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,840
they are products of mold and molds can

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,040
grow just about anywhere on walls on

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,719
couches and fabrics so again be aware of

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,240
this is not just a cannabis problem

34
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,760
this is something in general that's

35
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,719
important for it to be tested in

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
cannabis

37
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,478
but keep in mind that those mycotoxins

38
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,079
are not visible odorless chemical

39
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,000
released by mold and spore

40
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,920
formations and that's what makes them

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,280
such a concern

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,879
so what's the health threat you know

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,400
when we talk about mycotoxins so they've

44
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,239
been linked to kidney and liver damage

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,118
reproductive disorders and immune

46
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,879
suppression

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,118
canis material can also be contained

48
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,519
with mycotoxins during transport storage

49
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,319
as well as processing given the known

50
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,158
health risks

51
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,158
associated with exposure to these

52
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,240
mycotoxins testings

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,280
is an important safety measure for

54
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,719
consumers

55
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,399
and it's not just cannabis it's been

56
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,319
tested for

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,879
other crops as well other food related

58
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,679
crops is a real major

59
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,078
concern because of the damage it can do

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,159
to

61
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,919
human health in general so very

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,200
important is included with cannabis

63
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,519
testing

64
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,560
now there's also aflotoxins as well as

65
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,519
others well

66
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,920
particularly dangerous are the

67
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,359
aflotoxins a type of mycotoxin produced

68
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,878
by aspergillus

69
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,280
a flagellus a fungal species with

70
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,799
which is a potent carcinogen it's kind

71
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
of an example of how it looks and we can

72
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
see this highly branched appearance

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,879
allows these like spores to kind of

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,120
break off very easily get airborne

75
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:29,120
and be basically transported that way

76
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
it does produce aflatoxins in warm and

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,959
humid conditions

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,560
typically around that 33 degrees celsius

79
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
91.4 degrees fahrenheit

80
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,039
and 0.99 water activity so those are the

81
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,319
ideal conditions but it can of course

82
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,719
produce these outside of those

83
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,079
conditions even acute exposure can be

84
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,840
life-threatening if the dose of

85
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,319
aflotoxin is large enough

86
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,200
as the result in alpha toxins could

87
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,759
cause severe

88
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,759
liver failure a major concern there's

89
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,959
different aflotoxins so b1 is considered

90
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,719
the most toxic but

91
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,158
b2 g1 and g2 must also be considered as

92
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,759
they have result from decaying

93
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,560
vegetation in soils when warm

94
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,239
most moist conditions exist there are

95
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,640
regulations now that set limits on

96
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,519
allowable levels of toxins in foods

97
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,238
because of the great concern so the

98
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,200
world health organization the who

99
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,480
according to food safety digest from who

100
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,799
consumption of food

101
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,158
or product containing more than one

102
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
milligram per kilogram

103
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,199
and basically essentially one part per

104
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,239
million of aflotoxin can be enough to

105
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,079
lead to life-threatening

106
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:35,439
aflotoxosis and liver failure so

107
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,680
one part remember a very very small dose

108
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,280
alternately sustained exposure to lower

109
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,480
doses on the order of

110
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,318
20 to 120 micrograms per kilogram

111
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,719
daily for a period of one or three weeks

112
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,518
of aflatoxin b1 specifically

113
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,959
can cause acute toxicity and also be

114
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,560
potentially lethal

115
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,319
so as we can see the reason why there's

116
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,799
such a great concern

117
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,598
it takes a very low dose to get a

118
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,799
potential

119
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,518
lethal end result so we want to screen

120
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,159
our cannabis

121
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,280
for mycotoxins so both recreational and

122
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,120
medical cannabis

123
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,519
must now be screened for mycotoxins

124
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,719
derived from microbial contamination

125
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,640
this can be done in a number of

126
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,400
analytical techniques but due to

127
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,679
chemical complexities of the sample

128
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,358
extracts and the polar

129
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,478
and or reliable nature of some

130
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,519
mycotoxins they're good candidates for

131
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,599
lc-ms or lc-mssms

132
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,000
which is looking for that kind of liquid

133
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,520
chromatography and microspecs there this

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,879
is of course an extreme example we're

135
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,719
looking at mold developing

136
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,959
on the bud here but realize microtoxins

137
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,199
can be deadly at a very small level so

138
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,478
even though the product may look clean

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,000
we want to make sure we're still getting

140
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,719
it tested because even something that

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,879
looks clean

142
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,479
could still contain harmful levels of

143
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,040
mycotoxins

144
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,800
so lastly those safety requirements do

145
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,240
you know that cannabis is susceptible to

146
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,680
microtoxins and this kind of gives you

147
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,680
some information here

148
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,720
more than 40 years ago a paper was

149
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,800
published

150
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,919
that discussed the unfavorable condition

151
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
to these and produce

152
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,918
aflotoxins within cannabis and they can

153
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,560
occur also in

154
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,439
other plant material as well state

155
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
testing though

156
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,360
regulations typically have a maximum

157
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,680
allowable limit

158
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,680
of micro toxin detection on the sample

159
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,918
however there is variation in exactly

160
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,360
how the limit is applied between states

161
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,439
so keep that in mind

162
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,360
as an example the illinois department of

163
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,918
agriculture requires each of the five

164
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,720
main mycotoxins to be separately

165
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,319
separated under the limit of less than

166
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,080
the 28 micrograms

167
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,560
per kilogram but in nevada in california

168
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,000
the total sum of detectable alpha toxins

169
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,120
which include b1 b2

170
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,839
g1 and g2 combined must be under that

171
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,399
theoretical

172
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,439
limit so this is important consideration

173
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,198
so we're looking at the individual

174
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,600
microtoxins we're looking at the sum

175
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,038
total so keep that in mind look at your

176
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,639
state's regulations

177
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,319
for example new mexico's department of

178
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,199
health enforces one of the tightest

179
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,120
restrictions

180
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,319
of mycotoxin presence requiring the

181
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,439
collective amounts of all five

182
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
microtoxins

183
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,199
to sum to be less than the 20 micrograms

184
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,720
per kilogram

185
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,879
so important to know the regulations

186
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,280
understand the regulations and realize

187
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,800
the potential severe implications

188
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,758
of presence of mycotoxins as a continued

189
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,360
part to be

190
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,360
a well-informed and educated consumer
