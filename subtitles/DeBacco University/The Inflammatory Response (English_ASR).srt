1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,650
okay here we look at the inflammatory

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,560
response process now I like the image

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,230
included here of our foot showing

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,759
different degrees of inflammation with

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,559
this toe having the greatest degree of

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,059
redness we're going to learn about a

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,028
little bit more it's occurring at the

8
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:21,329
cellular level when we see this external

9
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:22,410
appearance on our skin so starting with

10
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:24,358
in general the inflammatory response

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,640
well it all starts with an injury and

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,160
ultimately it leads to the healing

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,778
process we may think of when we hear the

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,279
term inflammatory such as some of the

15
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,109
negative factors the redness the

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,809
swelling the heat in the pain but

17
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:39,960
essentially that is part of the healing

18
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:42,238
process and ultimately this is what has

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,100
to go through the body in order to try

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,820
to eliminate sources of infection so

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,109
that proper healing can occur

22
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,689
now inflammatory response here is our

23
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,759
skin and we have an injury a cup for

24
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:57,000
example in that skin we notice it's red

25
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,769
and the presence of bacteria here our

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,799
leukocytes or white blood cells are

27
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,250
leaving the circulatory system to invade

28
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:07,530
this area to try to prevent infection

29
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,019
now in general this inflammatory

30
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,180
response is triggered whenever the body

31
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,219
tissues are injured again in this case

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,810
we're looking at skin tissue the whole

33
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:20,400
goal is whole purpose of this is to

34
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,890
limit the spread of damaging agents such

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,170
as the bacteria also the body needs to

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,030
dispose of debris pathogens and this

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,728
sets the stage by out cleaning up this

38
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,430
area of potential sources of infection

39
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:36,209
this is the stage for a proper healing

40
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,820
or repair process looking at this image

41
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,709
we notice that three main stages are

42
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:43,228
occurring first we have injured tissue

43
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:46,078
there's up here and we're noticing our

44
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:49,170
leukocytes are entering that area here

45
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:52,889
this this leukocyte particular this mass

46
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,228
cell is really seen Piston chemicals are

47
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,390
causing the blood vessels to expand and

48
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,578
become more permeable and that's causing

49
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,810
a redness and swelling so this image

50
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,548
doesn't do a great job of showing the

51
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,579
redness and the swelling but what is

52
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:10,250
causing that redness in that swelling is

53
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:13,439
the red blood cells or the red blood

54
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,300
vesicles here becoming more permeable so

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,219
causing the redness and the swelling we

56
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,469
have this influx of red blood cells this

57
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:22,289
influx of white blood cells also to the

58
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:24,090
area neutrophils and then monocytes and

59
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:26,280
macrophages migrate to the site of

60
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,870
infection or injury so they're working

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,969
their way through these we'll sell them

62
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,250
at the dermal cells and they're working

63
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:34,770
their way to that initial cut and here

64
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,319
we're noticing some bacteria are being

65
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,060
taken in and destroyed eliminating the

66
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,209
chance they could get into the

67
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,300
circulatory system

68
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:48,090
now acute inflammation kind of we've

69
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,880
seen this picture simulator before but

70
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,170
shows the histamine being released and

71
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,859
here we see the white blood cells or

72
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,809
leukocytes exiting out the vesicle here

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,000
and entering the area where the

74
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,550
pathogens are present so mast cells

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,199
detect injury and nearby cells release

76
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,160
histamine initiating the inflammatory

77
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,439
response

78
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,060
histamine increases the blood flow to

79
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,609
the wound site we see an increased

80
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,530
amount of redness and increased vascular

81
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,600
permeability allowing fluid proteins

82
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,300
phagocytes and other immune cells to

83
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,769
enter in connective tissue these events

84
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,870
result in the swelling the redness of

85
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,540
the injury site due to the increase in

86
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,420
blood flow they can also feel warm if we

87
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,979
ever have that injury that occurs

88
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:31,889
inflammations also state of pain do the

89
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,780
events of stealing nerve pain receptors

90
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:36,599
that could be because of the initial cut

91
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,989
site or could be also because of the

92
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,180
cascading of events that's occurred now

93
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:46,230
signs of inflammation there's five main

94
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,239
ones we're looking redness clearly

95
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:52,259
evident here the feeling of heat and

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,319
swelling Evans pain and potential loss

97
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,509
of function in the inflammation area so

98
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:02,250
these are five cardinal signs of acute

99
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:03,719
inflammation as occurring histamine such

100
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,030
I mentioned before they help our body

101
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,800
get rid of irritants such as allergens

102
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,259
they can make you sneeze too you're up

103
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,700
pitch to help remove that irritant so a

104
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,129
lot of times we associate these with

105
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:18,839
being negative associations here's our

106
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:20,370
LR histamines typically our bass cells

107
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,769
are the ones that's inducing those

108
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,470
histamines and causes inflammation and

109
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,389
our increased mucus production so if

110
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,999
this is in relation to an allergen

111
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,550
this look that is very negative but it

112
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:35,069
can be advantageous in an inflammation

113
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,490
sense to help increase the blood flow

114
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:40,259
there and increase the white blood cells

115
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,538
now in relation to an allergy we have

116
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,038
things called anti histamines they're

117
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:45,930
chemicals or drugs taken in order to

118
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,418
reduce symptoms of allergic reactions

119
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,050
they block histamine which we see here

120
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,399
they're blocking some of those receptors

121
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,079
released from the mast cells they

122
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,810
decrease the incidence of symptoms

123
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,459
caused by histamine response so because

124
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,098
history is not able to bind all these

125
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:05,158
receptors the response is dulled and

126
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:07,829
this is what some of benadryl Allegra's

127
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:10,769
are tagged claritin some of these anti

128
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:13,228
histamines function in this very similar

129
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:15,778
format where they're able to block some

130
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:18,180
of the receptors clog up some of those

131
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:21,209
pores reducing the effectiveness of the

132
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,680
histamine reducing the allergic response

133
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:24,750
that we have you do some of the redness

134
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,610
and the swelling and the tearing and all

135
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,749
the negative associations that we have

136
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,749
with allergies
