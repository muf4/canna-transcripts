1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,080
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,480
going to go over carbon footprint

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,759
analysis for indoor cannabis production

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,679
and even if you're not considering

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,120
growing cannabis indoors this is an

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,199
important consideration

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,160
because we're all part of the electrical

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,960
power grid

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,560
and we want to be mindful of the impact

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,880
that indoor canvas production

11
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,879
has

12
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:28,719
[Music]

13
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,719
all right let's look at the carbon

14
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,678
footprint analysis for indoor cannabis

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,558
production

16
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,679
first off here is the research article

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,439
proper citation

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,719
front page kind of screenshot and as

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,079
well as a direct link

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,600
if you want to look at some of the

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,320
information presented here in more

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
detail

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,079
this is going to provide a general

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,280
summary so first off energy

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,960
cannabis energy consumption so the

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,039
emerging industry of indoor chemist

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,719
production utilizes high energy

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,239
intensive process and is highly

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,480
inefficient overall

30
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,519
in the united states this represents an

31
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,839
annual uh

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,198
energy expenditure of about 6 billion

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
what we're seeing here is kind of the

34
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,879
projected from 2019 to

35
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,798
2030 electricity demand

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,719
the kind of core demand growth the

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,560
electric vehicles data centers as well

38
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,599
as cannabis cultivation we can see this

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,478
over time

40
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,239
the anticipated great increase in

41
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,400
cannabis cultivation regarding

42
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,478
power consumption and really just power

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,680
consumption overall here

44
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,280
now we're looking specifically about

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,880
cannabis we're seeing lighting

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,519
ventilation and air conditioning being

47
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,199
the vast

48
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,039
majority there you might be wondering

49
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,960
about what's this vehicles well there is

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,520
transport involved with cannabis too in

51
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,039
general for consideration

52
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,560
so the carbon footprint for indoor

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
canvas production so

54
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,040
one kilogram of final product is

55
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,438
associated with emissions of about 4

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,200
600 kilograms of carbon dioxide

57
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,279
emissions to the atmosphere

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,799
aggregate u.s emissions are equivalent

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,879
to those of about three

60
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,920
million cars to kind of put it in

61
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,959
perspective

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,560
so this is kind of a little bit

63
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,599
concerning when we're looking at scaling

64
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320
up potential for

65
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,280
indoor cannabis production on the energy

66
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,478
inputs that is

67
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
needed for that particular process

68
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,039
now the carbon footprint for indoor

69
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,639
campus production we kind of saw a

70
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,839
graphical representation every single

71
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,159
more chart form

72
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,080
growers need to consider all aspects of

73
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,079
plant production that require energy

74
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,840
lighting is typically the highest but

75
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,920
what this is also ventilation

76
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
requirements that will also have energy

77
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,559
demands we need to be mindful of that as

78
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
well

79
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,598
in addition to vehicles that said drying

80
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
water handling

81
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,679
there's a whole bunch of other factors

82
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
to take into consideration as well

83
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,200
so it's not just those even though those

84
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
might be the greatest or highest energy

85
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,399
consumption

86
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
now we're looking at the carbon

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,439
footprint and we're looking at kind of

88
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,479
the energy cost at three levels of

89
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,400
efficiency

90
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,560
so for indoor cannabis the carbon

91
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
footprint represented here

92
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
and here we see indoor chemistry

93
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,519
electrical cost now we're seeing the

94
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,519
worst the average and improved

95
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,280
conditions and this assumes a wholesale

96
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,560
uh price of four thousand four hundred

97
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,318
dollars per kilogram

98
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,598
but keep in mind that wholesale prices

99
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,799
are highly variable

100
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,000
and also are poorly documented so the

101
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
worst conditions these would be the

102
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,280
least efficient

103
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,079
average would be your typical cannabis

104
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,919
facility

105
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,360
and improved conditions are ones that

106
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,719
are going to use more efficiency

107
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,640
symptoms

108
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,840
operations might come with more upfront

109
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,238
costs but hopefully

110
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,200
long-term reduction in cost and we can

111
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,519
see that there is some

112
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,079
variation overall but we can still see

113
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,879
that we are definitely consuming a lot

114
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
of energy

115
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,359
with our indoor cannabis production so

116
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,878
how does it compare so yes it consumes a

117
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,760
lot but how does it compare to other

118
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,798
industries

119
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,079
we're using 2006 data by sector and

120
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,560
chemist productions

121
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,760
sector is the greatest energy consumer

122
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,640
at nearly 20 megajoules and that's mj

123
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,000
per thousand dollars now chemist is

124
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,759
filed next by the paper

125
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,519
industry which is about 14 mega joules

126
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,239
per thousand dollars we can see here

127
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,640
though

128
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,920
clear sadly winner in this category as

129
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,759
far as

130
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,679
energy consumption goes compared to

131
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,719
these other sectors

132
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,319
then if we're going through we're going

133
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,959
to compare cannabis this is based on

134
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:04,399
sector

135
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,080
well now if we compare it by u.s

136
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,920
building type so united states

137
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
chemist production requires eight times

138
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,359
as much energy per square foot

139
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,438
as a typical u.s commercial building

140
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,720
also specifically it's four times more

141
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,199
than a hospital

142
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,239
and about 18 times more than an average

143
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,000
u.s home

144
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,000
so again this again gives you that idea

145
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,399
of the massive amount of primary energy

146
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,959
that's

147
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,319
needed for an indoor cannabis growing

148
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,079
facility

149
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,079
so outdoor growing why don't you even go

150
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,319
outdoor well outdoor growing is also not

151
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,000
energy free so just keep that in mind

152
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,079
there is less energy required but it's

153
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,839
energy free shifting cultivation

154
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,879
outdoors can nearly eliminate the use

155
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,198
for

156
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,199
cultivation process however energy is

157
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,800
still required for water pumping vehicle

158
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,400
transport during production

159
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,400
and distribution remains part of the

160
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,959
process and typically this is more

161
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,039
needed

162
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,079
than in for an indoor operation so

163
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
there's gonna be a little more increase

164
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,560
in cost there

165
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,000
but you're not going to have the venting

166
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,399
now the air conditioning you're not

167
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,160
going to have the energy generation cost

168
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,159
a common perception is that the potency

169
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,919
of cannabis produced indoors exceeds

170
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,080
that of the production of outdoors

171
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,639
leading to consumers to demand canvas

172
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,240
being produced indoors however federal

173
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,840
sources listed here as well as

174
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,120
independent testing labs actually find

175
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,758
similar potencies

176
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
when best practices are being used the

177
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,120
indoor facilities can produce a better

178
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,759
looking flower and that's sometimes

179
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,360
associated with the purchase of cannabis

180
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,800
so keep in mind the potencies could be

181
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,800
similar indoors can

182
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,478
usually have a more consistent and

183
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,560
better perceived

184
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,680
look associated with it if you're

185
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,519
looking at extraction

186
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,280
really would not matter if you're

187
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,079
growing indoors or outdoors but outdoors

188
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,279
will have less

189
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,639
overall energy inputs needed so the

190
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,079
negatives of outdoor production again

191
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,600
not because outdoor production is like

192
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,478
the the best way and the only way it

193
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,160
should be grown

194
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,079
electro cultivation still has some

195
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,759
negative environmental impacts

196
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,279
other than its energy use it could

197
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,199
result in deforestation

198
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,559
destruction of wetlands soil runoff

199
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,478
pesticides and

200
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,240
over application of fertilizers as well

201
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,120
so it's not free of potential negative

202
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
impacts

203
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,360
but overall they can be a little bit

204
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,880
less compared to what we've seen here

205
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
with the carbon input

206
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,120
for indoor cannabis production and keep

207
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
in mind as consumers you're driving the

208
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,240
market there so if you

209
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,439
are demanding the indoor production keep

210
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
in mind some of the other

211
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:21,360
side effects that come along with that

212
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,359
production process of cannabis
