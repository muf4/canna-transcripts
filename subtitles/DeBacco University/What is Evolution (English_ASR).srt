1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,759
so here i'm gonna try to answer the

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,919
question what is evolution

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,960
if you want kind of a fun music video to

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,120
kind of watch

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,039
well it may not be 100 scientifically

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,119
accurate uh right here right now

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,879
by uh fat boy slim is something you can

8
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,038
take a look at they kind of show

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,160
in there in that particular music video

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,920
process of evolution

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,079
so starting with what is evolution well

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,439
it's a change over time building on past

13
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,559
and current features so products evolve

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,118
knowledge evolves

15
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,960
and beliefs can evolve as well so don't

16
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,799
think it's just any one thing

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,719
is the example here clearly of the

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,799
phones and how they have evolved

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,759
uh within the mobile phone industry also

20
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,599
the changing that

21
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,640
that has occurred so within our uh

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,960
evolution

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,320
it's the mark of an educated mind to be

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
able to entertain the thought without

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,399
accepting it i know this can be a highly

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,079
debated or contested

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,679
topic so just keep that in mind as well

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,079
evolutionary patterns in biology have

29
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,479
been noted as far back as aristotle as

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,239
one of

31
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,560
his quotes there in the the bc era

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,760
darwin initially used the phrase to send

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,519
with modification

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,040
to explain the concept of evolution

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,879
now what is evolution looking at these

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,280
patterns of evolution

37
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,478
evolution have been observed in three

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,960
major areas

39
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,759
fossil records anatomical features and

40
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,079
molecular

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,759
distances so are fossil records finding

42
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,000
them in different layers how things may

43
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,000
have

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
changed again over time the different

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,280
layers of rock

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
anatomical features what similarities we

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,799
may see

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,600
that exist that may show a progression

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
and molecular

50
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,798
distances looking at our dna and what

51
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,519
similarities may be exist

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,040
there as well so looking at the fossil

53
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,200
records a little bit more detail

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,759
the evolution of a horse here provides

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
the most direct evidence for

56
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,200
macroevolution fossils are preserved

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
remain tracks and traces and once living

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,759
organisms

59
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,078
they are formed when organisms become

60
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,959
buried in sediment and calcium

61
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,559
in hard surfaces and are mineralized

62
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,158
array of fossils according to age have

63
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,478
often been provided

64
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
as excessive evolutionary change here

65
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,360
we're seeing the development

66
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,318
of what was once kind of many many toes

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,400
here to kind of

68
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:17,919
that one central hoof of a modern horse

69
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,680
array of fossils according to age

70
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,280
provides evidence of successive

71
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,879
evolutionary change

72
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,959
we can kind of see that over a long

73
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,639
period of time here you can also see

74
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,759
consistency so here we see different

75
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,958
rock layers and we're seeing

76
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,518
consistencies

77
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,800
uh over a period of time as well so

78
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,239
we're seeing things progress we're

79
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,280
seeing things found in the same layer

80
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,959
different regions

81
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,959
indicating they existed over multiple

82
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,680
areas all during the same

83
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,199
time this kind of shows also the kind of

84
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,000
formation of where things may have

85
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,479
existed and went extinct at certain

86
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,199
points

87
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,000
as well within our fossil records and

88
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,839
get very detailed

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,159
fossils have been found linking all

90
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,479
major groups the forms of linking

91
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,239
mammals to reptiles is particularly well

92
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,079
known you can see the high degree of

93
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,759
specificity that occurs here and how we

94
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,280
can trace things back

95
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,598
to common ancestors in group things as

96
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,280
similar species or similar related

97
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,598
species as well

98
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,560
so all things to consider here it can

99
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,238
get very very complex

100
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,239
looking at kind of one brief example

101
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,719
here looking at the kind of the the

102
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,319
whale

103
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,080
and kind of going back and where that

104
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,000
may have come from well when we're kind

105
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,799
of looking at this whale evolution

106
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,400
looking at it may once have derived from

107
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,599
organisms that once had

108
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,158
legs may have been land based as well

109
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,878
looking at the cow and the hippo here

110
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,959
kind of having distant relationships

111
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,639
and some of the progression in how

112
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,959
things don't necessarily always get

113
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,439
necessarily more complex

114
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,000
with evolution there's a better fitting

115
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,878
to their

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
environment now the anatomical records

117
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,840
looking specifically

118
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,759
it has a little cartoon representation

119
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,719
here but all for it rates share a

120
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,359
set of developmental instructions these

121
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,598
kind of

122
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,680
this fish this reptile this bird and

123
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,039
this human all kind of look the same if

124
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
i didn't put the

125
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,878
kind of titles here indicating that

126
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,438
there may be some

127
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,199
similarities that may have occurred

128
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,959
because they all look the same starting

129
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,158
very early on

130
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,160
now if you look at the kind of the

131
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,560
actual images uh you can see kind of the

132
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
same

133
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,918
pattern reptile the bird and the human

134
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,000
here very hard to distinguish the two

135
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,839
from a very early on indicating they may

136
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,839
have some sort of connection

137
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,159
uh early on to some sort of similar

138
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,719
species

139
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,600
we talk about homology and homologous

140
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,280
structures these are similar anatomical

141
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
anatomically but have different

142
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,478
functions they have different structure

143
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,720
and function but are all derived from

144
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,439
the same part of a common ancestor

145
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,520
chemistry produces this one two five

146
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,879
structures example provided here

147
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,639
adaptations to different environments

148
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,279
with modified its structure in several

149
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,040
ways

150
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,799
we see that here where we're having the

151
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,759
same anatomy the same

152
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,360
bones but very different functions the

153
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,800
human the cat the whale and the bat

154
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
well they have the same bones but the

155
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,240
humans using it for grabbing the cat's

156
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,120
using it for walking the whale for

157
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,038
swimming and the bat for flying

158
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,800
analogous structures in comparison have

159
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,399
similar features and functions

160
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,560
they resemble each other a result of a

161
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,120
parallel evolutionary adaptation

162
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
so here we have a fish we have a bird we

163
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,918
have a mammal

164
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and they have these very similar or

165
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,319
analogous kind of structures

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,839
all used for swimming but if you notice

167
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,478
that the bone structures are different

168
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,799
but they've kind of reached the same

169
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,758
end structure to be able to best meet

170
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,400
the challenges of their environment

171
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,759
that quick comparison of analogous and

172
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,519
homologous structures

173
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,960
again it kind of puts those two parts

174
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,120
together same

175
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,079
bones different functions different

176
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,959
bones same

177
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,599
function this also groups them as well

178
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,038
we see

179
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,560
here analogous structures all used for

180
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:49,918
swimming they have a different structure

181
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
but similar function

182
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,120
here we have similar structure but

183
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,240
different function as well just another

184
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,918
way to present the same

185
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,918
information so we're looking at

186
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,879
convergent evolution there's many paths

187
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,038
to one goal

188
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,800
so we have convergent and divergent so

189
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,000
divergent may be easier to initially

190
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
understand where we have a

191
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,079
vertebrae and we're separating out into

192
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,319
two distinctive paths

193
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,519
for example this branch on the left is

194
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,120
going to produce gills

195
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,639
and this branch on the right is going to

196
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,319
produce lungs

197
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,918
now when we have convergent evolutions

198
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,759
while we have this separation

199
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,359
now we have the shark and the dolphin

200
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,439
they're both living in an aquatic

201
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,160
environment while one may have gills

202
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,399
one may have lungs uh they are starting

203
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,319
to develop that streamlined appearance

204
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,000
uh they're trying to develop those fins

205
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,600
having that convergent evolution they're

206
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,160
kind of coming back and having very

207
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,560
similar

208
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,199
features despite being separated out one

209
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,639
having lungs again and one having gills

210
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,720
analogous structures are result of

211
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
convergent evolution different animals

212
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,280
often adapt in similar fashion when

213
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,478
challenges

214
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,159
by similar opportunities exist and we

215
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,439
can see that with

216
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,439
different animals living in different

217
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,639
parts of the world developing very

218
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,719
similar structures

219
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,680
to meet the challenges of very similar

220
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,680
environments
