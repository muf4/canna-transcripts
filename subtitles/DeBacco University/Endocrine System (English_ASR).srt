1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,928
okay here we're gonna look at an

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,520
overview of the endocrine system if you

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:08,209
look at the image located here on the

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,558
title side you can see a couple areas

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,300
glands that are very important to the

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,218
endocrine system because we're looking

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,000
at secretion of hormones in particular

8
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:19,618
see here in the upper area of particular

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,689
interest surrounding the brain thyroid

10
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,009
the thalamus to work our way down near

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,629
the pancreas and the adrenal glands

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,699
which are located on top of the kidneys

13
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,698
and ultimately the ovaries and the

14
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,130
testes so the endocrine system what does

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,630
this consist of well it's glands and

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,820
what are these glands do these glands

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,989
release hormones and they go directly

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,799
into the bloodstream

19
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:42,030
now hormones are hormones are chemicals

20
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,218
they're released is one part of the body

21
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,679
and travel through the bloodstream and

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,500
affect activities of cells in other

23
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,359
parts of the body so we're looking at

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,549
that connection between the hormones

25
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,280
being produced in small quantities in

26
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:58,259
one section one particular gland and

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,350
then it's going through the entire body

28
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,570
cousin in effect that could be from

29
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,460
cells that are very distantly located

30
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,250
from the original site or where those

31
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,500
hormones are produced now what does this

32
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,760
kind of look like well these releasing

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,769
the hormones which are chemical

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,530
messengers into the bloodstream signal

35
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:19,140
cells and these are signaling target

36
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,329
cells and they behave in certain ways so

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,810
when we say a target cell we need that

38
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:27,209
hormone to be able to bind to a receptor

39
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,540
to then cause a secondary messenger to

40
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:33,269
cause a reaction to occur this binding

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,710
stage is very important this is because

42
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:36,629
these hormones are produced in very

43
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,849
small quantities they circulate through

44
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,009
the entire body and only were they bind

45
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:43,949
will they cause that response to occur

46
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,680
this is a slow but widespread form of

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,420
communication so it's not very you know

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,180
super fast I mean this is circulating

49
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,599
throughout the body but it's providing

50
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:58,140
this communication of this hormone which

51
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,390
from one cell to a distant cell in the

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,709
body

53
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,810
double you might say it's kind of a slow

54
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,569
connection or slow kind of way of

55
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,810
regulating is we have a very fast system

56
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,549
called our nervous system so a lot of

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,250
people are comparing like endocrine and

58
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,160
nervous some people get these confused

59
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,250
are vastly different the nervous system

60
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,139
transmits electrical signals and

61
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,750
releases neurotransmitters to target

62
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:26,029
tissues these are very fast but short

63
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,520
lasting responses for our nervous system

64
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,310
the endocrine system which is our focus

65
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,350
here our ductless glands and they

66
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,129
secrete chemical signals directly into

67
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:36,650
the bloodstream

68
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:38,659
now chemicals travel to target tissues

69
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,959
these target cells have receptor

70
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:43,609
proteins these results in slow a long

71
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,590
lasting response

72
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,260
so again nervous system is quick kind of

73
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,090
movement of things endocrine system that

74
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,189
production of hormones is causing a

75
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,259
little bit of delay to the response but

76
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:57,709
will be a much longer lasting response

77
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:59,840
than the nervous system now comparing

78
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,479
MERIS and independent similars in

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,099
differences so some of our similarities

80
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,199
are they're both involved in maintaining

81
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,769
communal stasis they both secrete

82
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,569
chemicals the endocrine system those

83
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,610
transmitters are hormones that's how

84
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:15,319
it's getting the message across nervous

85
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,019
systems are actually neurotransmitters

86
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,810
occurring between neurons differences

87
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,090
here the nervous system responds much

88
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,789
faster than the endocrine system the

89
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,709
endocrine system lasts much longer when

90
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:30,099
compared to the nervous system nerve

91
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,289
impulses are transmitted vanarin

92
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:34,909
hormones are transported by the blood so

93
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:36,469
keep in mind that we're having this very

94
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:39,459
quick response and nervous system about

95
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:42,289
200 and over 250 miles per hour and

96
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:45,319
endocrine is relying on hormones which

97
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,250
are chemical messengers now regulation

98
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,780
of those chemical messengers

99
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,169
neurotransmitters again released by the

100
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,459
neurons important for the nervous system

101
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,429
hormones are released by the endocrine

102
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,650
glands and see just a couple is to here

103
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,129
so very different than our

104
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,610
neurotransmitters very short

105
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:02,900
communication here between neurons now

106
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,810
what does this endocrine signaling look

107
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,060
like we have a secreting cell the our

108
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,969
endocrine gland sending our kind of

109
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,979
hormone message and then it's bypassing

110
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:15,319
this out this is a non target cell has

111
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:17,149
the wrong receptor the wrong shape this

112
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,069
blue cell does have the proper shape and

113
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,379
that will receive the signal and cause a

114
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:23,300
response to occur this is like hormones

115
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:25,829
and binding is very important because

116
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,210
they're very specific

117
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:29,408
now messenger molecules cells must

118
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:31,269
communicate with one another to

119
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:34,029
coordinate cell processes within tissues

120
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:35,469
and maintain homeostasis well talk about

121
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:38,109
that little bit later but we need this

122
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,330
cell to cell communication and this is

123
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,520
carried out via messenger molecules and

124
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:44,709
they bind to different surface proteins

125
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,750
and as its gonna cause a response to

126
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:49,000
occur so do you need to understand look

127
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,918
at all the very specifics here no I want

128
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,658
you to get the journalist that we're

129
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,878
having this binding occurring with these

130
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:57,339
surface proteins causing a response to

131
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,490
occur in this case gene regulation

132
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:02,019
within the cell now this regulation

133
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,418
where hormones needed will do the

134
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:06,668
communication they are the actual

135
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:08,680
chemical messengers that's occurring in

136
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:10,568
one part of the body and traveling to

137
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,759
another part if you see here for example

138
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:15,310
growth hormones they're affecting

139
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,650
muscles the liver and bone grows so

140
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,379
we're seeing this one hormone causing a

141
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:22,239
response to occur more of a daily

142
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:24,430
routine they have regulation on large

143
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,288
scale such as regulating out blood

144
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,569
glucose levels but calcium levels the

145
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:31,629
salt in your body also related to

146
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:33,908
metabolism growth development maturation

147
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:36,579
and reproduction all of these involve

148
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:40,329
hormones and these feedback systems that

149
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:42,189
are occurring now endocrine hormones are

150
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:44,199
produced by ductless glands and secrete

151
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:45,668
into the bloodstream they may infect a

152
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,968
wide array of target cells to produce

153
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:50,109
multiple effects major glands that make

154
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:52,019
up the endocrine system on the

155
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,360
hypothalamus pituitary gland the thyroid

156
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:57,728
parathyroid adrenals ah so on and so

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,319
forth you can see a whole list here I'm

158
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:01,538
not going to make you memorize all the

159
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,460
individual hormones but realize each

160
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:06,459
hormone is produced in a very specific

161
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:09,098
gland located in very specific portion

162
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:11,138
of the body there's two major types of

163
00:06:09,098 --> 00:06:13,269
hormones peptides which are small

164
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,860
proteins and steroids which are lipids

165
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:16,628
so important to note there's very

166
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,348
there's differences between those two

167
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:21,610
and how they react

168
00:06:19,348 --> 00:06:23,709
some other hormones too are just too

169
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,718
close here erythropoietin is secreted by

170
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:28,718
the kidneys and this stimulates bone

171
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:30,810
marrow to produce red blood cells many

172
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:31,930
other organs as we just saw there

173
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,149
besides

174
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,978
endocrine glands also produce hormones

175
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:37,930
kidneys produce several hormones that

176
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,069
relate blood pressure which is essential

177
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,449
for kidney function

178
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,399
so there again they're helping maintain

179
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,729
that blood pressure and you can do that

180
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,109
to hormones the digestive system also

181
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,509
puts in several hormones that regulate

182
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,270
appetite so you can see how there's a

183
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:54,399
lot of complexities on on here he's very

184
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:56,709
important all these operate and function

185
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,339
properly so the body can maintain

186
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,339
homeostasis
