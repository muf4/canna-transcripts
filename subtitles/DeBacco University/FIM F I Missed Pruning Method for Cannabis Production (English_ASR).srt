1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,520
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,719
we're going to go over the femme pruning

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,720
technique for cannabis

4
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:14,399
[Music]

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,640
all right let's go over the fin

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,118
technique which stands for f

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
i missed printing method for cannabis

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,719
production here

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,800
so the goal of this technique is to

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,358
create multiple tops we can kind of see

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,278
that pictured here quite well

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,599
this multiple tops is great if you're

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,920
looking at cloning for example

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,600
it's typically done when you're cutting

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,039
or topping a plant but not really making

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
a clean cut

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,119
because true topping would eliminate

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,040
this kind of center portion here

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,799
and only allow for kind of like two main

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,479
branch points to kind of come out

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,839
uh here we're looking at multiple

22
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,519
branching points

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
as if the grower feels like they look

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
back and china did topping but kind of

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,920
like

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,280
missed that clean cut is kind of kind of

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,440
what the name implies

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,960
you can also see here multiple kind of

29
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,960
points growing out and this is why it

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,799
can be good for cloning

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,719
however this is technique is not

32
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,319
recommended for autoflowers

33
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,079
so again we're seeing some other

34
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,359
examples here the reason why it's not

35
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,438
recommended for autoflowers

36
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,519
is because it will delay plant growth

37
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,279
this result in lost plant matter

38
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,519
production days which will mean for

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,079
autoflowers it will likely not reach

40
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,158
its full potential so this technique is

41
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,438
used on autoflowers the advantages will

42
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
likely be mitigated

43
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,798
by the required increase of plant

44
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:27,359
numbers required to make up the

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,439
difference

46
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,118
so again you could do with autoflowers

47
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,319
but not recommended simply because of

48
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,000
the delay in time that's going to occur

49
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,438
now that top section that kind of

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,040
portion here

51
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,959
this is what it looks like just to kind

52
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,200
of give you an idea of what you're kind

53
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,679
of

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,040
removing when selecting a top to prune

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
growers should be looking for a tip that

56
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
has four

57
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,118
full nodes and it's developing a fifth

58
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,640
look specifically at the small early

59
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,560
kind of branch points in the leaf

60
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,599
clusters it's kind of looking right down

61
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,280
here

62
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,839
typically five to six nodes up on the

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,079
plant will allow for maximum efficiency

64
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,880
when utilizing this technique the plant

65
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,559
stem tip

66
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,000
remaining will grow back slowly into

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,200
multiple new branch points

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
oftentimes there can be some

69
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,080
discoloration do the physical damage of

70
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,439
the area

71
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,599
but again something you really should

72
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,840
not be that concerned with

73
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,519
the timing of this so when we're looking

74
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
at you know when we go through and

75
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
implement this technique there may be no

76
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
exact time

77
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,039
but the general rule is start two to

78
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,560
three nodes up the plant you don't want

79
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,560
to do it much earlier

80
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,878
than that this can result in a box like

81
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,039
plant of about two and a half feet wide

82
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,639
and tall just to give you a general idea

83
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,400
and it might depend on your

84
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,839
strain your variety you might be growing

85
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
and also the conditions how quick you're

86
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,159
flipping them over into flowering

87
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,759
but this kind of gives you an idea of

88
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,719
kind of what you're looking for

89
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,759
uh when topping and kind of this filming

90
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,120
technique because it is a

91
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,759
modified version of toppin

92
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,360
now what if we bend and then thin some

93
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,959
growers actually take the plants bend

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,440
them because we can see here at 90

95
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,360
degrees

96
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,639
and then thin their plants to maximize

97
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,560
the plant space

98
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,238
while minimizing the overall plant

99
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,080
height this technique can

100
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,920
also produce many growing points that

101
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,879
can allow for efficient production of

102
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,878
plate material

103
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,239
particularly for cloning purposes

104
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,439
because we're taking the bending portion

105
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,039
growing this portion out

106
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,158
and then filming other portions here

107
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,039
again to get more branch points thin

108
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,560
is part of a complete pruning method so

109
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,759
film can be used in conjunction with

110
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,799
other printing methods so i think just

111
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,878
because you're filming

112
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,840
that's it that's all you can do you can

113
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,079
utilize it or

114
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,439
correlate it with other techniques often

115
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,480
used with the screen of green because

116
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,759
you're trying to get those multiple

117
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,238
branch points going

118
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,239
mother plants for cloning and also again

119
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,680
as i said a modified version of topping

120
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,039
and this kind of shows a good example of

121
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,400
taking the same plant here if you were

122
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,439
going to thin the plant you'd cut it

123
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,120
right here

124
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,120
a level if you were topping the plant

125
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,920
though you'd cut it lower here

126
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,039
closer to where those that actual

127
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,039
branching

128
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,079
leaf petiole nodes kind of come into

129
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,280
intersection there

130
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,360
so again thinning we're going to cut it

131
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
up here topping we'd cut it lower than

132
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,599
that

133
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
last thing we're looking at the plant

134
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,560
hormone shifts associated with the thin

135
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,719
technique

136
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,080
the cut results in many new growing tips

137
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,878
and this kind of looks like a zoomed in

138
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
version here

139
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,639
again if we were topping we'd be cutting

140
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,158
right here but feminine were up here and

141
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,158
that's allowing these multiple little

142
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:18,000
branch points to kind of grow out

143
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:20,560
which is great for having these new

144
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,839
meristems new areas that could be used

145
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
particularly for cloning

146
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,799
or if you're looking at that screen of

147
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,160
green method where you kind of need a

148
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,439
lot of these little branch points to

149
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,320
kind of go through and work your way

150
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,759
through the screen

151
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,759
this is another way that it could be

152
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,759
implemented hopefully this gave you some

153
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,960
good information about the fin technique

154
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,960
for cannabis cloning
