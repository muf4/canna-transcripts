1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,680
okay here me to describe the basics of

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,450
experimental design and when we come

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,099
across a problem when design and

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,740
experiment is the general steps you

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,080
should follow so first step is a

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,570
generate a hypothesis start by simply

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,640
asking a question and then complete some

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,320
background research and then generate

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,670
the hypothesis so we're talking about

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,039
generating that hypothesis you know to

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,600
start right with that you want to ask a

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,699
question first and then complete some

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,019
background research you can see that

14
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,150
we're getting here we're gonna test the

15
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,919
hypothesis during new data do you agree

16
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,079
or not agree and then work from there

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,329
but that first step is kind of identify

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,039
a problem gather some data and then

19
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,289
generate that hypothesis it's got to

20
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,539
come from somewhere

21
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:44,640
now once we develop that we want to look

22
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,628
at an independent and dependent variable

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,399
so here we're starting with the

24
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,820
independent variable this is a variable

25
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,270
often termed denoted as X whose

26
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,259
variation does not depend on that of

27
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,510
another

28
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,119
well scientist changes or what changes

29
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:02,878
on its own so a way to think about this

30
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,948
is the independent variable is for

31
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,450
example the fertilizer building at

32
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:07,259
growing the plant the independent

33
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,750
variable could be the amount of

34
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,270
fertilizer added so that would be an

35
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,010
example of independent variable contrast

36
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,289
to that we look at dependent variable

37
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,170
well it's a variable off node by Y whose

38
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,670
value depends on that of another what is

39
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,469
being studied or measured

40
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,719
so if our independent variable is the

41
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:27,118
fertilizer our dependent variable would

42
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,938
be the height or how big the plant is

43
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:33,359
growing so again going back for a second

44
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,949
independent variable what the scientist

45
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,078
is changing for example the amount of

46
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,600
fertilizer dependent variable would be

47
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,758
the amount that the plant is growing so

48
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,408
again lot of students kind of confuse

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,019
those two that should be a pretty clear

50
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,079
way to think about them at least one

51
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,699
example then that experiment they what

52
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,188
is an experimental scientific procedure

53
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,320
to undertaking to make a discovery test

54
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:57,688
hypothesis or demonstrate unknown fact

55
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,938
so it's kind of a broad definition there

56
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:01,648
but it's kind of performing those tests

57
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:04,109
and that could be you know in sterile

58
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,978
lab here or it could be looking at can

59
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,959
you generate power from a carrot now as

60
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,719
a control group in good experiments so

61
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,159
when we think about control groups as a

62
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,319
set

63
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,240
that does not receive a treatment by

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,069
their researchers so in this case you

65
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,960
can with the plant example were looking

66
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:23,459
at adding fertilizer the control group

67
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,710
would be the set of plants that does not

68
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,300
receive any fertilizer the goal of this

69
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,030
is to provide a benchmark to measure how

70
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,590
other variables perform kind of getting

71
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:37,199
into that separate group and you may see

72
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,689
in drug studies a placebo or sugar pill

73
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,399
when it doesn't have the chemical

74
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:44,639
substance in there again after that

75
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,980
benchmark to then act for comparison

76
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,779
their constants are different than

77
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,069
control groups constants are portions of

78
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,280
the study or experiment that does not

79
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:55,799
change so for example pi is the same

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,870
number regardless so a constant in our

81
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,700
plant growing example could be the size

82
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,379
of the container we don't wanna have

83
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:04,139
some plants growing in small pots and

84
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,180
some growing in large areas or outdoors

85
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,549
and indoors when I've Constance when I

86
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,080
have the media that they're growing and

87
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,270
one of the container growing in the

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,760
environmental conditions as constant as

89
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,740
possible across all plants allowing the

90
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,469
potential for fertilizer variables to be

91
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,210
shown then we have different trials that

92
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:22,439
we may go through and do this is a

93
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,689
number of times that protocol is

94
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,210
followed a lot of times experiments not

95
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:30,270
just done once and that's it trials are

96
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,099
given may grow plants in a greenhouse we

97
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,590
could grow them for you know the month

98
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,000
in the summer months ago and then repeat

99
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,039
that in the winter months human

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,780
conditions the same Navon times these

101
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,699
experiments are repeated which refer to

102
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,800
as different trials so you may see the

103
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,169
average of trials average of experiments

104
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,680
you can see here some small tubes again

105
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,639
different trials repeating that again

106
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,520
Clifton analyze the results while

107
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,289
collecting data is an easy format

108
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,390
initially and we need to change when

109
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,709
it's published for others to see so

110
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:00,689
analysis can take on many different

111
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,459
forms which determine on the questions

112
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,439
asked or the purpose of the research

113
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,689
either they should be determined before

114
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,759
the research is concluded so you don't

115
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,139
wanna say be determined the questions

116
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,939
ask the purpose of research at the end

117
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,129
kinda want to have that at the beginning

118
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,439
and kind of that's driving the entire

119
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,839
process there

120
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,519
lastly the conclusion summarize how your

121
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,228
results support or contradict your

122
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,459
original hypothesis include key facts

123
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,859
from your background research to help

124
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,000
explain the results as needed so that

125
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,800
conclusion is kind of take

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,649
information taking what you've seen

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,300
taking some things she may have taken

128
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:35,639
notes on and kind of developing that

129
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,379
conclusion summarizing those results so

130
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,899
that someone when reading your study you

131
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:42,269
can kind of see what you're able to find

132
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,719
and then potentially build on that in

133
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:44,719
the future
