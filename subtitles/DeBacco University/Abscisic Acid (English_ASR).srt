00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,379
here I'm going to provide a brief

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,359
overview of the plant hormone abscisic

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,509
acid after wondering what this is

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,910
pictured here this is an open and a

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:15,779
closed stomata and it's involved in this

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,329
process so abscisic acid typically

7
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,549
abbreviated ABA it's kind of incorrectly

8
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:23,250
named that it's not related to obsession

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,010
with its SLOS plant growth so what you

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,570
see a abscisic acid please don't confuse

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,550
it with a position because it is not

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,250
involved in that it's important in

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,469
drought stress and other stresses

14
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:37,460
particularly important for causes these

15
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,710
stomata to close so we see our target

16
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,170
guard cells here if we add a BA or

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,120
abscisic acid it can cause cells to

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,239
become flaccid through the guard cells

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:51,558
here mr. monitor close so when plants

20
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,788
want to help decrease sir what a loss

21
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:56,308
abscisic acid can be a hormone that can

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,030
be activated to help close this dimana

23
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:01,530
of those plants in addition sisig acid

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,270
prevents seeds from germinating while

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,129
they're still on the plant plant doesn't

26
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,630
want to have it to germinate before fall

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,180
so the ground can kind of grow and

28
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:11,429
prosper there so abscisic acid is

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,680
involved in that it's also involved in

30
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,950
suppressing seeds from germinating even

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,290
when off the plant for example apple

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,890
seeds have a very high amount of acetic

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,750
acid takes them years naturally to be

34
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,840
able to germinate it's because of their

35
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,640
high optic acid content the Pacific acid

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,799
also changes gene expression patterns

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,540
and it's considered in return homeland

38
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,790
because it can block the effects of

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,590
auxins so keep in mind we have a lot of

40
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,780
these hormones that are interacting with

41
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,509
one another stick acid in one of those

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,700
its inhibitory Homan actually suppress

43
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,909
or block the effects of auxins in the

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,909
plan
