1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
okay and this be able to give a brief

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,719
overview regarding autumn leaf color

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,120
changes and how we go from a deep green

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,699
leaf to slowly over time getting to a

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,980
light green getting to a yellow getting

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,500
to an orange or red to a deep red and

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,320
ultimately Brownlee what's going on in

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,539
the leaves through this process will the

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,390
start on what plants do this and in that

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,590
all plants go through this color change

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,820
deciduous trees are the ones that go

12
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,070
through this there's ones that drop

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,929
leaves in the fall time when this is

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,270
does this occur again since the fall

15
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:36,238
time or autumn how does this happen

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,370
there's a precise sequence of steps that

17
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,828
plants go through and have a very

18
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:42,269
distinctive pattern that they follow why

19
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,780
is this advantageous to the plant while

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,940
the plant

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,289
kind of like wastes all the energy you

22
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,449
put into developing the leaf

23
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,670
well it's using the most efficient time

24
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,170
of the year and maximizing that then

25
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,870
realize in the winter there's just not a

26
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,429
lot going on it's very cold out and it

27
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,649
drops its leaves it's more efficient

28
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:01,019
than just to chase it we go dormant

29
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,539
during that time however this is only

30
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,000
possible through a very precise sequence

31
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,769
of steps so the plant is and wasting

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,239
energy

33
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:11,158
so in general how the trees know that

34
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,769
it's fall time it seems like every tree

35
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,930
in an inner region knows its quote it's

36
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,840
full time and there's a couple key

37
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,409
factors one is the shortening days and

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,689
this is reduced sunlight intensity

39
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:26,460
temperature is also decreasing so

40
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:28,769
there's certain indicators that these

41
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,868
plants can sense that kind of it's fall

42
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,359
time winter's coming let me get ready

43
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:35,188
and prepare myself to be able to go

44
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,349
dormant so I can survive through the

45
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,658
harsh winter and come back better and

46
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:41,759
stronger in the springtime so again it

47
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,590
has to do with the position of the

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,450
northerners some southern hemisphere in

49
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,159
relation to the Sun and this is how we

50
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,579
get our seasons because of the tilt of

51
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,920
the earth and how it rotates and then

52
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,509
revolves around the Sun and because of

53
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,430
this this is how plants know in our

54
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,430
region that's how we can develop these

55
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,590
maps of peak foliage times to be able to

56
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,390
determine when would be the best time to

57
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,899
go see some of the better colors in

58
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,978
different parts of the United States so

59
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,479
where did the colors come from what

60
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,969
color tune is indicate changes in

61
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,770
concentrations of certain pigments so we

62
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:15,659
see here kind of no change to tree

63
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,270
being there and the coloration

64
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,189
differences that's going on here as long

65
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,540
as you're not colorblind typically from

66
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:23,909
late August or early November is when

67
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:26,250
we're seeing this transition occur and

68
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:28,740
this particular color palette here is

69
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,539
for sugar maple trees different trees

70
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,189
may have different color patterns that

71
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,750
go through the sugar maples in

72
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:37,439
particular are known for producing some

73
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,860
very brilliant colors so what's going on

74
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,930
here

75
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,480
well leaves are green do the high

76
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,490
percentage of chlorophyll but as this

77
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,649
gets depleted other pigments become more

78
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,600
dominant leaves don't actually change

79
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,700
color that's kind of a wrong misnomer

80
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,069
that we typically say well it's actually

81
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,989
happens the colors are always there it

82
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,359
is happened to be hidden under the

83
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,760
dominant chlorophyll so as we reduce our

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,220
chlorophyll the next most dominant

85
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,659
pigment is this carotene it's a yellow

86
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,460
color so as you break down the

87
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,560
chlorophyll now together carotene let me

88
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,719
break down that and we have our into

89
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,210
silent and as we break that down and

90
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,789
from our oranges to our Reds we're

91
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,950
changing the pH of the leaves changing

92
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:18,419
I'm sorry the pH of the potential soil

93
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:21,689
or have a changing weather conditions

94
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:23,849
and this is what can cause a variability

95
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:26,520
in the color that may be seen in a

96
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,289
region from year to year Louis there's

97
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,270
gonna be a good color or bad color year

98
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:32,370
weather does play a little bit of a

99
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:36,060
factor in this to be able to get the

100
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,700
full color range that may occur now

101
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,250
what's actually happening on the leaf or

102
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,719
the atomic level here we're noticing

103
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,490
that chlorophyll is of course the most

104
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,879
dominant and then we're breaking the

105
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:50,580
chlorophyll down the carotenoids here

106
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,030
may be maintained and as an orange or

107
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,160
yellow color Rubisco and other proteins

108
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,930
are recycled so it's important to

109
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,819
realize this transition of colors is

110
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,010
occurring because the plant is trying to

111
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,870
conserve as much energy it's breaking

112
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,849
down the chlorophyll first then it's

113
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,709
breaking down the next stage here and we

114
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,659
see that evident here bring down the

115
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,239
chlorophyll then a carotene

116
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:14,579
then our anthocyanin and it's try to

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,160
conserve and store some this energy to

118
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,109
be able to be ready for next spring if

119
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,090
it just simply dropped its leaves and

120
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:23,250
wasted all this energy that it put in

121
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,469
what may not have enough energy reserves

122
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,879
to be able to produce these leaves in

123
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,310
the following spring

124
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,079
ultimately ends in cell death and that's

125
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,910
the brown color that we typically see

126
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,769
and shortly after that the leaves will

127
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,689
drop if you have noticed when the leaves

128
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:38,939
drop there's not much to them because

129
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:42,209
the plant has tried to conserve or take

130
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:45,300
back as much usable products that it did

131
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:47,819
produce and store them in the trunk this

132
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,770
then will be used as initial source of

133
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,139
energy to go to push through the next

134
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:53,909
leaves in the fall and spring some

135
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,919
people take advantage of some of these

136
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,930
stored sugars in the tree trunk through

137
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,030
the process of maple syrup where they

138
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,650
need freezing temperatures at night and

139
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,899
above freezing temperatures during the

140
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:05,849
day to really get the SAP flowing and

141
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:08,099
they're able to kind of harvest some of

142
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,970
the sugars that the plant has reserved

143
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,610
in its trunk

144
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,160
hopefully it gives you some appreciation

145
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,720
for the color changes that we see you

146
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,220
see a little bit of that background of

147
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,760
actually what's going on from the plant

148
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,760
standpoint
