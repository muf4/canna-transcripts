1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,879
are you considering using city or tap

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,960
water for outdoor cannabis production

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,120
this debaco university video will

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,120
provide you with some good information

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,160
as far as what you should be looking for

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:17,919
and be aware of

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,920
when using this type of water source

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,799
[Music]

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,400
all right let's get into using city or

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,439
tap water for outdoor cannabis

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,518
production

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,800
well first off you need to taste test

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,640
the base water

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
no matter what the source you're using

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,799
you need to have an idea what the base

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
source has for a starting point this can

17
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,519
include the parts per million

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,599
the ac the ph the temperature and which

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,160
all can be very easily determined with a

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,320
quality

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,799
water meter specifics for city water

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
though include what type of

23
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,359
antimicrobial is being potentially added

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,679
to that water

25
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,399
so chlorine fluorine chloramide are

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,719
other

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,679
definitely things to be considerate of

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,079
we're talking about

29
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,280
city or tap water also sometimes called

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,478
drinking water and there's some

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,079
tests available here that we can see

32
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,560
now why is chlorine used so it's a very

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,118
common additive added to city or tap

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,040
water

35
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,959
chlorine is a cheap disinfectant that is

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,680
effective at removing microorganisms

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,879
infections protozoans that can develop

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,280
in the water supply

39
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,640
so this is why it's added in this for

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,359
these purposes it's a good thing that

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,719
it's added

42
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,478
we want to be mindful of this if we're

43
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,359
looking at irrigating plants

44
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,118
or potentially using a supportive

45
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,400
microbe environment

46
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,078
so the change from chlorine to

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,200
chloramine this is something that's

48
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,438
being used a lot of other

49
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,478
a lot of towns so it's important to

50
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,039
understand if your

51
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,560
municipality is making this change or

52
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,280
has made this change

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,759
a chloramine is more stable although it

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,920
is a weaker disinfectant than chlorine

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,159
chloramine is ammonia added to drinking

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,519
water containing chlorine

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,840
you can see a picture of that kind of

58
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,118
molecule right here as a result this

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,520
does stay in the water

60
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,159
much longer for a much longer duration

61
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,640
of time

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,640
than chlorine chloramine levels of up to

63
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,718
four milligrams per liter

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,879
or four part per million are safe for

65
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,280
drinking so just be aware that there are

66
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,159
safe

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,400
levels of this particular kind of

68
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,359
additive that's being put into many of

69
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
the drinking water

70
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,560
supplies now for filtering chlorine

71
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,000
this goes back to chlorine we're

72
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,159
typically looking at what's called an

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,680
activated carbon filter these carbon

74
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,439
filters are some of the most effective

75
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,840
tools at reducing chlorine

76
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,439
content from water they're also common

77
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
in households since these filters can

78
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,639
also improve the general taste

79
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,000
and odor associated with chlorine that's

80
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,159
people just tend not to like to drink

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,959
that now the most common type

82
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,239
of carbon filter is actually a activated

83
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,519
carbon filter which we see

84
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,920
here and this effectively reduces and

85
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,759
also filters many contaminants in

86
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,679
unwanted components from the water

87
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,878
and this is why they are so commonly

88
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
seen

89
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,919
now we have filtering chlorine with a

90
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,719
catalytic

91
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,359
carbon so a different kind of process

92
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,680
this is

93
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
less common is a more advanced form of

94
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,560
carbon filtration this called catalytic

95
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
activated

96
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,680
carbon filtration this process has a

97
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,759
higher capacity for chlorine reduction

98
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,599
and can effectively reduce chloramines

99
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,039
as well so keep in mind that just

100
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,399
because oh it's a carbon filter

101
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,719
we should try to find out a little bit

102
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,680
more of the specifics and this is why

103
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,080
one may cost

104
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,920
more than another and we're filtering

105
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,799
out that chlorine again

106
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,238
focusing on that in particular a lot of

107
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,439
people will use

108
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,080
faucet mounted filtration systems

109
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,280
and this is an activated charcoal filter

110
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,959
to treat tap water

111
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,719
these are not advised simply because

112
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,959
they're small size and rate

113
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,318
which the water is emitted that water

114
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
typically will mean

115
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,399
it's restricted in a way that will not

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
allow sufficient irrigation to plants

117
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,719
particularly on a

118
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,080
even a mid-sized scale both due to these

119
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,359
factors means the less chlorine is

120
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,599
filtered out

121
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,640
than with an activated carbon filter

122
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,959
used in more

123
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,318
common comprehensive and large filters

124
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,000
so keep in mind not only will the flow

125
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,560
rate be reduced but because these are so

126
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,639
small

127
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
the amount of chlorine they're moving is

128
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,119
also reduced which kind of

129
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,400
negates the point you're trying to do

130
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
now filtering out

131
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
chloramine we talked about earlier this

132
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,959
filtration technique is

133
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,759
expensive versus the ones we had just

134
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,238
heard about

135
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,799
here for chlorine to remove chloramine

136
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,359
you need

137
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,560
an expensive carbon filter to remove the

138
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,120
chlorine included

139
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,600
in the chloramine molecule then you want

140
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,600
to utilize ideally reverse osmosis

141
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,759
or a cation filter this will remove the

142
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,919
ammonia content within the water

143
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,040
and we can see here more complex more

144
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,279
components

145
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,400
of potentially longer duration of time

146
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,319
to filter

147
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,399
so in more moving parts or more

148
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,120
components to be considering changing

149
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,239
out or

150
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,478
hopefully not having any leaky fittings

151
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,160
now a lot of growers will combine and

152
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,240
use multiple systems

153
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,840
so while the overall flow rate of water

154
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,478
may be reduced combining multiple

155
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,959
systems

156
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,439
this can help ensure all particulate

157
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,038
chemicals and organisms are removed

158
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,800
this often is utilized with a storage

159
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,719
tank of some kind simply because the

160
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,120
flow rate is often too slow

161
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
to be used for irrigation directly be

162
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,038
sure this system is sized or potentially

163
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,478
oversized for your current operation

164
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,719
to ensure there's enough water for the

165
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,000
plants and oversizing it will allow you

166
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
the chance to potentially grow more

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,519
plants

168
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
or just have more water on hand we can

169
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,159
just see a mock

170
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,839
example here of a water softener carbon

171
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
takes an ro system

172
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,359
and then a storage tank kind of all

173
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,639
