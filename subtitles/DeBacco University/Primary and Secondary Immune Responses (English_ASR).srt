1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
okay here we go look at primary and

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:08,460
secondary immune responses and this

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,190
graph here on the title slide bruce's a

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,950
good summary so our concentration of

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:16,890
antibodies here on the y-axis in time on

6
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:19,108
the x-axis with our initial exposure and

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,390
we see our response immune response is

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,580
actually quite low the primary immune

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,580
response is a low affinity of antibodies

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:28,108
we do have a recognition over time we do

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,879
have an increase in the concentration of

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,890
antibodies and ideal it clears up the

13
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:34,679
problem and then the problem goes away

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,109
and our antibodies reduced in

15
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,109
concentration however we notice here at

16
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,780
the lowest point this not near the low

17
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,579
rate of initial exposure we do notice

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,780
here at this particular point we have a

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,520
secondary exposure to this same initial

20
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,859
threat to the the body so the immune

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,719
system becomes activated we see becomes

22
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,509
activated a much shorter period of time

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,460
and it increased concentration of

24
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:01,140
antibodies this is because we have a

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,870
high affinity of antibodies able to bind

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,939
very efficiently and after the disease

27
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,789
is gone vitamin taken care of we see the

28
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,069
decrease again but we noticed that our

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,310
secondary response is much greater and

30
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,599
it takes a lot less time so looking at

31
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,950
this a little bit more specifically in

32
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,959
industry that's a little confusing here

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,460
with all different colors the primary

34
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,408
response is the first encounter with a

35
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,609
foreign antigen there's only a few B

36
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,759
cells and T cells that can recognize

37
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:28,438
this antigen as a result binding of an

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,629
integer to its receptor on the

39
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,188
lymphocytes stimulates cell division the

40
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:34,709
clones produced and this is called

41
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,478
clonal selection now we're looking here

42
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,149
at this different graph our relative

43
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:43,469
level to antibodies in some cases and we

44
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,540
have our days of infection here on the x

45
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,759
axis so we see some of these are

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,890
antibodies IgH sound familiar

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,500
IgG sounds familiar we also have natural

48
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,210
killer cells neutrophils so this is not

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,280
relative level of antibodies that we saw

50
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:59,218
in the first one this is just relative

51
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,868
level of immune response and we can see

52
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:03,149
our innate immune system occurs you need

53
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:05,340
early stages and then our adaptive it

54
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:10,080
takes over later that gives us more that

55
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,719
long-range control and memory IgA ABC

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,980
has a long delay and it comes up our cd4

57
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,680
t-cells occur

58
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:20,429
over time IgG is very quick early on and

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,340
then tapers off in plateaus here looking

60
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,980
at a very simple graph here antibody

61
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,950
concentration our first sex scene or

62
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,449
infection we have our increase decreases

63
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:32,429
to a point but keep in mind where that X

64
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:35,039
is our secondary point of infection

65
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,080
occurs it's not anywhere near as low as

66
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,969
the first time we see a decrease

67
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,340
interation and an increase in our

68
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:42,500
antibody concentration this second time

69
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,150
around

70
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,090
continuing on how this looks specific to

71
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,469
IgM and IgG if you look at the antibody

72
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,150
lecture you'll see reference to these

73
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,128
don't provide a little bit more detail

74
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,620
on each of these well compared to the

75
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:57,500
primary response the secondary antibody

76
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,180
response occurs more quickly and

77
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,000
produces antibody levels that are higher

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,209
and more sustained the secondary

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,189
response mostly lives IgG so notice our

80
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,640
primary and our secondary both have IgM

81
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:14,219
involved both have IgG involved but by

82
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,189
far the secondary ones mostly involves

83
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:21,090
the IUD we see that rapid rapid increase

84
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:23,039
and that much higher level antibody

85
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,889
concentration of IgG the second time

86
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,229
around then that first time well we

87
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:30,780
still notice in both cases IgM is first

88
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:34,518
initiate while IgG and the secondary

89
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,959
times is a very important component

90
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,310
types of acquired immunity so we have

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,669
our acquired immunity there's two main

92
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,159
forms we have active where organisms has

93
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:47,430
their own kind of educated cells we have

94
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,189
passive where organisms acquire only the

95
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,450
antibodies from another source so our

96
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:54,239
natural acquired an artificially

97
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:58,048
acquired well the active were cells it

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,659
educated here could be a vaccine dead or

99
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,950
in attenuated pathogens then we also

100
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,409
have our passive which is an injection

101
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,358
of immune serum this is two different

102
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,400
types we can get artificially acquired

103
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,590
immunity naturally acquired immunity

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,909
through the active process is infection

105
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,699
contact with the pathogen this is where

106
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:16,439
we actually get sick a passive version

107
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,569
of naturally acquired our antibodies

108
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,060
passed from mother to fetus via the

109
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:23,029
placenta or infant in her milk it's a

110
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,959
passive way of occurring as antibodies

111
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,479
particularly for cows it's very

112
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,129
important very soon after birth

113
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,030
that they're fed the mother's milk

114
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:35,129
because that can help get antibodies to

115
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:37,469
cross over the barrier so they become

116
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:40,680
part of the individual if you missed

117
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,080
that only about one two-hour window of

118
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,389
colostrum is the actual mother's milk on

119
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,800
the earlier stages the antibodies will

120
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,979
not be able to pass the barrier and that

121
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,360
individual can easily become sick it has

122
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,490
to go through the active process which

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,939
can be very dangerous so a passive is

124
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,019
that simple passing of the antibodies

125
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,750
lastly our summary of how the immune

126
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:02,159
response works we have our immunity

127
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,990
innate immune system remember this could

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,360
be physical barriers and our adaptive

129
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,689
immunity we have both artificial which

130
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,910
in the antibody transfer in immunization

131
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:14,399
or natural which is passive through the

132
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,680
maternal mother's milk example or

133
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,599
through the placenta and active through

134
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,120
actually getting sick through the point

135
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,650
of infection so hopefully that clears up

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,800
and gives you a little bit more detail

137
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:28,310
of both primary and our secondary immune

138
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,310
responses
