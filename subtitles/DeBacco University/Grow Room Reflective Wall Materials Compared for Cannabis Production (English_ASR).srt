1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,120
ever wonder what reflective wall

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,599
material you should use for your grow

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,799
tent

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,290
here we're going to investigate that

5
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:15,440
question here on debaco university

6
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:16,399
[Music]

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,118
all right let's look at some of the

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,079
reflective wall options well first off

9
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,198
when we're setting up

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,479
a grow tent or a grow room may wonder uh

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,679
what should put the what should the

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,359
walls with

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,879
since indoor growing areas will have

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,880
walls and growers are paying

15
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,919
for that light you want to maximize the

16
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,640
efficiency

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
of those light units that you're paying

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,880
for

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,640
since india areas have walls maximizing

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,920
reflectivity of those walls can be a

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,640
simple way to provide plants

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,079
more light without increasing costs

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,160
canis is a highlight demand

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,280
plant so good reflective surface is

25
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,839
beneficial

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,198
now the data presented here is from the

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,559
video here on

28
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,519
micro microlight.com here he provides

29
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:56,959
pretty good information

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,640
i'm just providing a summary but i

31
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,239
welcome you to check that video out for

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,920
more information

33
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,079
now the equipment that he used there

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,920
we're looking at a 600 watt hps with a

35
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,478
wing reflector and he also used a 400

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,400
watt led panel which is a mars hydro

37
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,760
no reflectors in the fixture high power

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
purple light fixture

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,000
there was utilized not these exact

40
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,280
images but gives you a good idea

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,280
how he's measuring light was with the

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,400
quantum sensor the apogee sq500 here

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,400
so first off let's start with the

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,320
control and that is basically no walls

45
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,439
if you just set up kind of a growing box

46
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,319
in a bigger room

47
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,599
input any walls well looking at the

48
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,599
amount of flight that was gotten

49
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,478
and received 640 this is ppfd is what

50
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,478
they're measured in

51
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,118
all other trials will provide a percent

52
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,438
of increase from this baseline level

53
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,879
so 640 and 400 are our baseline that's

54
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,519
if we had a grow area with

55
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,959
no walls now if we put the walls up with

56
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,399
just a plain wooden wall

57
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,599
which would be kind of our most basic

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
form of walls well we get a 7.81 percent

59
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,919
increase

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,319
of our hps and a five percent increase

61
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,159
with our led and we could see the ppfd

62
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,839
readings that we are up to

63
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,280
now if we upgrade or take those wooden

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,359
walls and put a

65
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,040
well white paint on that a matte white

66
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,639
paint we see an

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,239
point seven to five percent increase in

68
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,399
a ten percent increase from

69
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,080
those base levels where there were no

70
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,760
walls added originally

71
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
so again here we're getting a little bit

72
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,280
more well if we use white marl which is

73
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,318
like a plastic shiny

74
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,759
uh plastic material uh keep in mind that

75
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,719
for hps it had the same ppfd as the

76
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,159
matte white paint

77
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,639
and on plain wood so not as much of

78
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,239
a benefit there to add the plastic for

79
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,318
high pressure sodium set up

80
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,680
but for leds we saw a little bit more of

81
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:38,878
an increase twelve and a half over no

82
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,480
walls

83
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,759
now through silver mylar so instead of

84
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,518
getting the white what about the silver

85
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,318
aluminum coated plastic will definitely

86
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,760
saw an increase

87
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,719
both in the high pressure sodium and the

88
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,199
leds and what got us the greatest or

89
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,039
what was

90
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,318
completing the data with the greatest

91
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,239
increase

92
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,318
with that photosynthetic light activity

93
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,120
was the silver mylar with the diamond

94
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:58,639
pattern

95
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,959
very commonly found in grow tint

96
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,238
materials and we can see why

97
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,239
not only the increased amount of

98
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,599
reflective light but also reduces the

99
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,800
chance for hot spots

100
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,318
so what is all this state if we saw it

101
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
kind of in one area well i'll just kind

102
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,719
of put it all here in a nice little

103
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,519
summary

104
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,800
we can see how no walls was our baseline

105
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,158
plain wood white matte

106
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,439
uh painted on the wood white marlar

107
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,318
silva marlar and the silver metal in the

108
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,079
diamond pattern

109
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,439
how that did generate the greatest

110
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,959
return there

111
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,280
so if you're a grower looking at set up

112
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,360
a grow room what would i suggest

113
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,640
well basically your light source is less

114
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,879
important than the wall surface

115
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,479
used while any clean wall surface will

116
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,239
benefit over no wall

117
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,919
using silver mylar with diamond patterns

118
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,878
results in the greatest amount of light

119
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,399
reflected

120
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,840
this material is found in most grow

121
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
tents but make sure it is in your

122
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
growing space if not

123
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,679
consider adding it so you get the

124
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,319
greatest reflectivity of the light

125
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,879
less light loss that you're paying for

126
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,280
anyway

127
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,919
to hopefully maximize your plant

128
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,919
production
