as the name implies this will be a quick

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,200
visual guide of nutrient deficiencies in

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,400
cannabis

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,240
and if you identify any of the images

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,320
something you may have there'll be more

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,920
detailed videos provided here

[Music]

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,439
all right let's get to that quick visual

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,399
guide for nutrient deficiencies in

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,480
cannabis well

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,038
first off try to avoid those you want to

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,359
focus on the ph the nutrient deficiency

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,160
is

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,200
suspected be sure the ph the plants are

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,199
growing in is near

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
optimum as this will ensure nutrients

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
are available to the plants

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,000
typically we're talking in that you know

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
six ish

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,439
range six to seven or so getting a

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,078
quality

23
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,079
ph pen or ph meter when it does ph

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,439
temperature as well as ec

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,439
or ppm is also advised

26
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,198
now here are just some of the major

27
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,799
nutrients so the first one is nitrogen

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,799
where the lower leaves are yellowing and

29
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,878
the upper leaves are still green

30
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,399
phosphorous shows this kind of overall

31
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,840
kind of yelling with some brown

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,320
colorations typically found

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
lower in the leaf canopy and potassium

34
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,118
is evident by the

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
yellowing of the leaf margins now if

36
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,239
looking at our secondary nutrients we

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
have magnesium which is yellow

38
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,039
intervenally

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,880
meaning between the veins we have

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,118
calcium which is this kind of brown

41
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,839
speckling along with some yellowing

42
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,200
and then iron deficiency which is those

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,880
upper leaves are showing

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,880
the yellow unlike the nitrogen

45
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,039
deficiency or the lower leaves were

46
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,959
as said before not to lie to you this

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
was to tend to be a short video

48
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,559
any of these look like of concern in

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,439
your plants search the channel

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,399
for more detail on all of these nutrient

51
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,639
deficiencies
