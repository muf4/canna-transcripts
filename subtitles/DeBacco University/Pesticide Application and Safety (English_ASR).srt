1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
here we look at pesticide application in

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,210
safety and these rules apply whether

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:08,219
you're doing a large-scale spray or a

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,710
little spot spray or spring the whole

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,500
field with a backpack sprayer all of

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,150
these rules still apply in the key part

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,769
here what the safety is that you want to

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,649
read and follow the labels that are

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,329
posted there the label is the law is

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:24,299
kind of the nice little way to remember

11
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,278
that you want to use only what's needed

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,289
you want to use low toxicity pesticides

13
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,969
if that's an option when I consider the

14
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,340
weather if you're an outdoor application

15
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:34,829
don't apply just before a heavy rain on

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,030
chance it could be washed away when of

17
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,980
these proper equipments you're getting

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,289
good coverage for both the plants and

19
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,148
protecting you proper disposal of empty

20
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,670
containers when you're done or finish

21
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,899
the pesticide container avoiding teaming

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,809
the environment meaning don't apply

23
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,179
right next to waterways protect from

24
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,979
exposure for yourself post warning signs

25
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,198
as we see here in no emergency

26
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,929
procedures and that's good if you're

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,659
applying them also a worker on an area

28
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:03,659
that might be using pesticides again we

29
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,908
see these signs and danger and these big

30
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:09,539
red signs and the the skull and the

31
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:12,060
crossbones here so while it is word for

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,750
caution they can be applied in a safe

33
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,900
manner

34
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,790
if you do take into consideration what

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,650
the label says and properly protect

36
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,810
yourself there's different types of

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,368
pesticide products one is wettable

38
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,280
powders as we see here with the cocoa

39
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:28,109
powder making chocolate milk wettable

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,640
powders are a dry product that mixes

41
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,109
well with water to create a liquid

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,478
suspension that can be applied through a

43
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,219
variety of methods growers tend to like

44
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:37,890
this because of the smart small storage

45
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,118
space of the actual product then there's

46
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,189
actual liquid products and these are

47
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,349
liquid suspensions girls like the ease

48
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:46,169
of use of this and we see here with like

49
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,938
creamy reduce here ease of use with this

50
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,109
product but sometimes the binders can

51
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:51,269
hold that all the chemical and

52
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,789
suspension can cause increase the chance

53
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,769
of leaf burn so let's do some growers

54
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,110
didn't like the wettable powders because

55
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,879
they lack that binding agent then

56
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,649
there's dust or powders and that can be

57
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,599
applied simply as like this powder form

58
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,070
growers should have typically applying

59
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,259
these products and getting even coverage

60
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:08,758
especially for outdoor applications it's

61
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,400
almost not possible there's always a

62
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,479
little bit of breeze if you dip to get

63
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,000
around plants with the dusted product

64
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:19,090
there's making product applications so

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,520
any systemic synthetic chemical products

66
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,349
are not advised for cannabis because of

67
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,900
they will go through the entire plant

68
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:28,180
and can end up in the buds and when

69
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,770
burned can cause volatiles to form I'm

70
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,599
gonna be careful to read the labels

71
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,130
however this presents quite a challenge

72
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,989
for cannabis because there's typically a

73
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:38,289
lack of labeling of products

74
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,730
specifically listed for cannabis sprays

75
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:41,979
can be beneficial but can be over

76
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:44,469
applied so just be mindful of when you

77
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:46,599
made a last application and why you're

78
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:49,120
making that application Fido Texas City

79
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,039
can result as more damage than benefit

80
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,050
so you want to be mindful is you want to

81
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,539
be applying something to your plants for

82
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,460
the overall benefit not the hon watch

83
00:02:55,539 --> 00:03:00,159
the spray timing low light is preferred

84
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,990
and that in Kurds outdoor applications

85
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,849
and low light also in indoor

86
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,260
applications you want to mixtures

87
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:06,849
products because you want to get it done

88
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:08,229
quicker wanna do what's called a jar

89
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,819
test or your mixing those ahead of time

90
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,439
to see if there's any interactions that

91
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,939
are occurring and hot temps will

92
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,889
increase the likelihood of damage to the

93
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,300
plants too important that outdoor

94
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:18,579
applications very experience the heat

95
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,980
wave or indoor applications if you're

96
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:24,090
applying it the peak of heating and heat

97
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:27,039
of the gross space that you have product

98
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,620
applicators the plant Arian location

99
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,669
will help in deciding what's the best

100
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,129
fit for your applicator

101
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:35,319
there's a pump sprayer as we see here a

102
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:38,189
hand or backpack and allows for maximum

103
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:41,259
control invest for small spaces and or

104
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:43,180
localized applications if we see here a

105
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:44,349
miss blower it's motorized in logic

106
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,050
quickest coverage with minimal effort

107
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,629
can also get really hot all on plans

108
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,880
very high applications it's basically a

109
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,189
leaf blower with a water tank on the

110
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,079
back through that electric foggers on an

111
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:57,939
offer many benefits as the miss blower

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,160
here but better suited for indoor

113
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:02,560
operations and again you can cover that

114
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,449
nice kind of fog that even coverage of

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,550
plants these are just some different

116
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:08,619
ways you can apply pesticides taking all

117
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,469
these into consideration will allow for

118
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:15,060
efficient application for the plants and

119
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:15,060
minimize environmental impacts
