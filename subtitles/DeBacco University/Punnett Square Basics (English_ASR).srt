1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,469
okay gonna go over some punnett square

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,209
basics here so I've talked about these

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,339
are the simple squares here is to be a

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:10,800
mono hybrid cross and we're gonna focus

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,349
on right here so first off when it

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,759
squares I consider Mendel's cross a

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,949
purple flowered with white flowered pea

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,289
plants peas gonna represent dominant

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,990
allele and same for purple flowers and

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,460
little pea or lowercase P represent

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,739
white flowers so the recessive allele

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,219
using these conversions to the above

13
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,288
cross symbolize big P big P homozygous

14
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:33,119
dominant with homozygous recessive a

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,460
punnett squares are grid structure than

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,558
Able's the calculations other result

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,620
genetic crosses possible gametes are

18
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,299
listed along to opposite sides and the

19
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,530
genotype of offsprings are represented

20
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,449
by the cells in the squares the

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,960
frequency of these genotypes in the

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,809
offspring is called by probability so

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,219
what's it looks like here's our square

24
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:54,119
okay so this is our punnett square and

25
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,670
that's where it gets its name from the

26
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,429
square we're gonna put our gametes so we

27
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,160
are as a result we cross a homozygous

28
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,109
dominant of the homozygous recessive

29
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,599
meaning our possible gametes from that

30
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,609
resulting offspring are heterozygous one

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,949
big p with one little p one big p is one

32
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:12,540
little p so here's our dominant

33
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,780
recessive allele turned down recessive

34
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,969
allele as we can see and the previous

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,739
ones to flip it for a second sometimes

36
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:21,900
the male goes on top and the female on

37
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,309
the side here in this case because

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,250
they're both heterozygous we don't have

39
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,868
to distinguish which ones which so all

40
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,299
we're going to simply do is carry these

41
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:32,250
down so what this would look like is our

42
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,590
little p comes down here and this little

43
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,590
p comes over here so this would be

44
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,750
homozygous recessive two little P's and

45
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,950
we speed that from here our big P would

46
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,328
convened here our little people come

47
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,640
here this offspring would be

48
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:46,199
heterozygous and we supposed to do the

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,478
same thing here big P little P would be

50
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,960
heterozygous and here would be

51
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,250
homozygous dominant here so this is how

52
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,919
we go through and do a Punnett square

53
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,328
simply carry the offspring through again

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,299
gametes who need one from mom one from

55
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:03,239
dad and resulting in our diploid

56
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,450
organism here today and how that looks

57
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:09,030
on the large scale here in this case Big

58
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,459
B is gonna represent purple and little

59
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,800
these white this is that same cross just

60
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,129
a little bit of a more of a represented

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,380
here for the genotype and also providing

62
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:21,240
with this genotype so you can see while

63
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,069
these three differ in the genotype the

64
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,439
phenotype what they look like would be

65
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:30,539
the same and evident here mandela's

66
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,359
flower colors opponent square here's our

67
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:35,280
two dominant alleles two recessive he's

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,450
holding in our heterozygous I think

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,800
those heterozygous we cross those

70
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:41,429
together and that's where the white one

71
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,290
comes back so we take these heterozygous

72
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,300
I'm sorry homozygous dominant and

73
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:47,159
homozygous recessive we're generating

74
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,750
all these offspring colors the offspring

75
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,280
may be purple but they're also

76
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,039
hundred-percent do you know typically

77
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,689
are heterozygous we take these offspring

78
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,090
we cross those together and that's where

79
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:00,750
the homozygous recessive comes back and

80
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,450
in 25 percent of the cases now we're

81
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,849
looking at the dominant so as a result

82
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,310
it's hard to tell and we can't tell

83
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:10,769
these two looks whether it's homozygous

84
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,550
dominant or heterozygous because that

85
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,200
dominant allele

86
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,439
you only need one copy for it to be

87
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,000
evident or seen so what's called a test

88
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,430
cross in this case we take a brown

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,949
colored mouse can be homozygous or

90
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,200
heterozygous you can't tell by simply

91
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:26,399
looking at the phenotype one can tell

92
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,560
from results of the cross between the

93
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,849
test mouse with the homozygous recessive

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,830
Mouse and that's what we have pictured

95
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,229
here in this case the white mass

96
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,270
represents homozygous recessive two

97
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:38,579
little a's two little eyes when we cross

98
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,850
our brown mouse with our white mouse if

99
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,650
all the offspring are brown we know that

100
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,530
that original Mouse that parent Mouse

101
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,930
here was homozygous dominant because

102
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,500
that is past its traits onto all the

103
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,500
offspring

104
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,030
here if it was heterozygous that

105
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,009
recessive allele is going to match up

106
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,479
with this recessive allele and as a

107
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,769
result we running at 50% of the

108
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,199
offspring here that would be homozygous

109
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,880
recessive resulting in we know now the

110
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,189
genotype of that Mouse to be

111
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,810
heterozygous so this test Cross is

112
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:11,909
testing whether or not the organism in

113
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,030
this case the mouse representing the

114
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:17,939
dominant trait is Gino typically

115
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:21,589
heterozygous or homozygous you see that

116
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:24,089
same example here with our yellow pods

117
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,978
in this case be heterozygous we see

118
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,539
those recessive alleles being expressed

119
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:29,129
in some of the offspring

120
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,110
so fun let's square show a typical test

121
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:32,159
cross two potential outcomes the

122
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,990
individual in question may be either

123
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,330
homozygous in which half the offspring

124
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,340
will be heterozygous and half would be

125
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:40,649
homozygous recessive or homozygous

126
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,819
dominant in which all of the offspring

127
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:43,709
would be heterozygous and that's

128
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,599
represented here again if it was

129
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:47,250
homozygous dominant all the offspring

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,350
will have that one dominant allele and

131
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,910
all say of that same color here if it

132
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,210
was heterozygous to begin with will

133
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,520
notice that the recessive allele is

134
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:57,689
shown you know typically hopefully that

135
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,219
gives you a quick and basic

136
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:02,810
understanding of punnett squares that we

137
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,810
can build from in future lessons
