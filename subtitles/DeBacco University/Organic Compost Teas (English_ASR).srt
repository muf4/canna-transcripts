1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,169
okay me here the term organic compost

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:05,160
teas tossed around a lot it's iffy I

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:06,778
should provide you with a little

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,650
background and exactly what these are

5
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:13,620
and teases you we see here as we think

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,859
about may have in the morning or you

7
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:19,799
know with that brunch a very similar

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,689
concept here at organic compost teas but

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,330
I'm getting compost teas probably want

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,910
to drink those so they're a liquid

11
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:29,729
extract of a solid based compost that's

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,320
the basic term organic teas here so

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,640
putting me the teabag layer that allows

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,350
water to come in we're kind of

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,179
developing a liquid extract of what

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,039
normally would be solid the event

17
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,170
benefits are said to be able to add to

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,570
supercharged liquid of microbes to your

19
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,250
soil and I'm taking the idea of what's a

20
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,020
solid form and creating a purified

21
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,780
liquid form which opens up your

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,010
opportunities for application now while

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,020
there already many microbes in the soil

24
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,939
in organic tea increases the rate of

25
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,739
replication kind of being the ideal

26
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,448
environment for them however there's

27
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,419
little control of the exact microbes

28
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:03,058
that are being produced or replicated in

29
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,890
many cases they were going to keep the

30
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,500
limitation is important to realize this

31
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,450
process doesn't create anything new it

32
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,099
only provides an environment to allow

33
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,170
the naturally occurring microbes in the

34
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,030
compost to multiply so you're not really

35
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,189
developing anything brand new you're

36
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,259
just kind of multiple increasing what's

37
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:21,269
already there in developing it into a

38
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,129
form it can be applied in many different

39
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:24,359
ways

40
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:26,250
the organic tea studies they're

41
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,219
scientific studies showing effectiveness

42
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,250
are limited for organic compost teas

43
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:34,109
while dr. Elaine Ingraham is considered

44
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,090
to be the gold standard there are a few

45
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,959
replicated studies that support many of

46
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,520
the claims

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,379
so again just because you find one

48
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,569
article you want to go through and find

49
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,569
it from multiple sources so if you have

50
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,789
a good not only a good understanding but

51
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,978
multiple sources to support that

52
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,570
particular common view so that was a

53
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,090
brief overview hopefully that gives you

54
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:57,949
just that basic background and of

55
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,950
exactly what an organic tea is
