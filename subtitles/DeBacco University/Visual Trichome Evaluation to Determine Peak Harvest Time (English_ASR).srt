1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,599
in this debacco University video we're

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,839
going to look at visual triome

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,519
evaluation to determine Peak Harvest

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,679
Time utilizing images uh from students

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,879
in my class as we can see located right

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,320
here to try to investigate tricomes and

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,160
give a grower Viewpoint so you can best

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,198
relate it to potentially something that

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,199
you might be able to see

10
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,678
[Music]

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,118
yourself all right let's get into

12
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:30,759
looking different's favorite structure

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,558
the Tricom

14
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,439
so first off why should we even look at

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,119
the tricomes well remember tricomes

16
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,599
provide an indication of the plant's

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,919
ripeness and cannaboid and turpine

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,840
concentrations visual evaluations which

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,800
be provided here may not provide the

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,280
exact number but it can indicate when

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,198
the greatest concentrations of these

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,520
compounds are likely to occur in the

23
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:52,519
plant a plant sample chemically analyzed

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,600
is the best method in providing with a

25
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,079
certificate of analysis though this is a

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,960
time timec consuming and costly so out

27
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,198
of the reach for most Growers so the

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,920
visual inspection can get very close to

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,079
Peak Harvest with minimal cost helping

30
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,799
Growers maximize production can also

31
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,640
help Growers utilizing the chemical

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,600
analysis for when they should sample

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
their plants to be submitted for their

34
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:13,798
certificate of analysis so we got our

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,640
different tricomes well the bulbus ones

36
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,600
are the smallest ones you really need an

37
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,640
aid to be seen yes we can kind of make

38
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,000
them out here and a little bit here uh

39
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,879
but they're very difficult because of

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,640
their size to be seen they can

41
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,719
synthesize cannabits and derpin so just

42
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,799
because they're small doesn't mean

43
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,400
they're not contributing um they can

44
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,200
swell in size once they fill with oil

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,000
the cesil ones are the larger than the

46
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,560
bulbous ones but still hard to see with

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,959
the naked eye they develop early about

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,680
on 3 we old plants or so so they can be

49
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,039
seen quite early however the stocked um

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,640
glandular capitate tricomes are the ones

51
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,880
most Growers are focusing on they are

52
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,799
the large ones they can be seen with the

53
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,718
naked eye and they're the prize troms

54
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,200
that appear during flowering and but

55
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:56,000
they are also because of their stocked

56
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,118
nature most likely to get damaged as

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,159
well so what are we looking at what are

58
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,560
we actually looking at when we look at

59
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,359
their Tricom an individual infloresence

60
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,000
here with majority of the organs covered

61
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,399
with stocked gland or tricomes the arrow

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,679
right here indicates the cluster of

63
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,199
kales and and bra covered with those

64
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,680
tricomes B is looking at a darkfield

65
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,878
micrograph of stock or tricomes

66
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,840
protruding from the KX of the epidermis

67
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,759
biosynthesis of secondary metabolites

68
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,560
occurs in the secretory disc cells

69
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,759
lining the base of the globular triome

70
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,120
head and the metabolites are stored in

71
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,719
the clear portion here at the top here

72
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
um and they will turn milky white to

73
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,639
Brown over the course of the flower

74
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,839
maturity which we'll see in the images

75
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,199
coming up the graphic illustration here

76
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,120
for stock triome structure giving some

77
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,039
idea of kind of the uh locations of

78
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,519
different cells and differentiated cells

79
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,519
I should say within that stocked

80
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,640
triome so we look at the color

81
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,920
differences these are distinctive clear

82
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,799
cloudy and Amber so clear you can think

83
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,598
of it as being quote unquote empty and

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,040
basically not ready for Harvest if you

85
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,119
can see right through it quote there's

86
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,679
nothing in there then we get the CL CL

87
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,239
ones and those are increased levels of

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,640
cannaboids as well as tpin and the Amber

89
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,719
ones are current are the converting in

90
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,399
this stage uh desirable compounds into

91
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,199
maybe changing to less desirable

92
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,439
compounds basically becoming a little

93
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,639
bit quote overripe in some cases um

94
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,680
there so we're really looking for this

95
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,199
cloudy to Amber kind of range uh there

96
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,519
all right so can we use the pistols you

97
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,039
know I know we're going to talk focus on

98
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,280
the tricomes but can we look at the

99
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,400
pistols well pistols can provide a quick

100
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,000
guide but this is really the tricomes

101
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,000
where the cannabinoids and Turpin are

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,598
stored so this is the plant part that

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,719
should be absorbed with attention to

104
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,039
detail typically recommend to use the

105
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,878
pistols as kind of just a quick

106
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,959
indication quick way to kind of look at

107
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,158
the flowers um as you're going down a

108
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,519
row or looking at a plant but really

109
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:47,438
kind of drives the oh wait those look a

110
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,080
little more of the ambery color let me

111
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:50,519
now Look at the tricomes this will be a

112
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,640
little bit variety and genotype

113
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,079
dependent but the pistols can be used as

114
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,679
an indication but we really want to use

115
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,120
the tricomes as the final determination

116
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,200
of whether we should be harvesting

117
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,438
something or not and again pistols

118
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,479
located here tricomes are those clear

119
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,120
Wiest structures located right next to

120
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,878
the leaf surface so the traditional

121
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,799
method of course is use a loop it works

122
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:13,919
great and still recommended but it can

123
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,799
be hard to really share what's seen you

124
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,478
know it's really hard for me to kind of

125
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,798
have a loop look at something and then

126
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,680
can I give the loop to someone else and

127
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,918
have them look at it um so kind of you

128
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,759
got to develop the eye you got to get

129
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,719
really up close and personal with it it

130
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,960
takes a little getting used to um

131
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,320
however there is something called the

132
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,839
maxi camera again not sponsored by them

133
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,120
in any ways a student had brought one of

134
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,758
these in and we us utilized it in class

135
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,399
and you'll see some images from that

136
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,720
it's a compact handheld camera

137
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,799
microscope that can connect an

138
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,720
electronic device allowing you to live

139
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,400
to kind of see what's going on and to

140
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,199
capture those

141
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:50,959
images so these are actual images uh

142
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,840
from class I teach uh at the University

143
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,478
of Connecticut these were taken of the

144
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,079
Abacus plants uh from class in weeks 6

145
00:04:55,478 --> 00:05:00,918
to 8 of flower with the help of a

146
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,198
student Maxi camera and Thanks goes out

147
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:04,319
to aarin for the use of that um so you

148
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,759
could be able to capture some of these

149
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,959
images you're seeing this is a

150
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,360
macroscopic look of what one of the buds

151
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,959
looked like and now we're going to take

152
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,160
a little bit more of that zoomed in

153
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,799
version there of the triome

154
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,000
structure so first off the pistols that

155
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I just talked about well we don't want

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,959
to use them for indication they can

157
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,280
contain tricomes so there are still some

158
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,120
tricomes that have developed on the

159
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,399
pistols these are not the ones really to

160
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,439
focus on not all triom contain the

161
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,839
desirable compounds the amber brown

162
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,478
color of the pistol here um is an

163
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,478
indication that this flower is nearing

164
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,478
Harvest time but is the inspection of

165
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,079
the tricomes that really makes the final

166
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:41,680
decision and wi the

167
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,198
Harvest so here we see kind of mostly

168
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,199
clear Tricom so close but not yet the

169
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,439
stock capitate tricomes can be seen

170
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,560
however most are clear indicating that's

171
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,279
too early to harvest there are some

172
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,399
initial kind of cloudy tricomes but

173
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:57,239
overall population must be taken into

174
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,079
consideration and most of them are clear

175
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,478
in nature there so a little too early

176
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,719
but good to start

177
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:05,478
looking now the previously clear are

178
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,240
basically now turning cloudy as we can

179
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:09,159
see that right here this indicates an

180
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,598
increase in the amount of canabo the

181
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,360
plant is producing and we're nearing

182
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:16,918
that point of harvest there so this is

183
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,639
kind of an exciting time uh good time to

184
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,719
kind of prepare the plant for that final

185
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,800
area there that final Harvest that's

186
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,319
coming very soon now note I've had put

187
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,199
some purple Arrow highlights that some

188
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,080
are having these purple colorations

189
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,879
um to the stocks now this is mainly

190
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,839
genetics and um that cause this and not

191
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,759
environmental factors so it is possible

192
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,079
for the grower to enhance the color

193
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,479
based on various plant stressors

194
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,120
temperature light spectrum and light

195
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:47,359
intensity are a couple of those that can

196
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,560
enhance this but really has to come from

197
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
the genetics at least initially and some

198
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,160
are more apt to produce more purple

199
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,959
coloration uh than some other varieties

200
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,560
again this is mainly

201
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,000
Abacus so those purple concentrations

202
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,280
again you can see on the macroscopically

203
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,560
as well as kind of almost

204
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,918
microscopically here this is a sign of

205
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,720
anthocyanin production this is a water

206
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,959
cble pigment in that in a larger class

207
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,360
of compounds known as flavonoids that's

208
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,439
a major category this is a subset of

209
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,919
that category while anecdotal some

210
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,038
people have reported better symptom

211
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,758
relief with um in the presence of

212
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,399
anthocyanins so something to consider um

213
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,319
if you're looking uh you know different

214
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,638
varieties and you kind of see some that

215
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,960
purple coloration anthocyanins might be

216
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,400
something you want to look at as an a

217
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,279
certificate of analysis report now Peak

218
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,839
cloudiness as we kind of see here um

219
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,359
this would be the earliest recommended

220
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,758
Harvest but typically the goal is to see

221
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,000
a few ambers before harvesting this is a

222
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,560
sign that we're just almost quite there

223
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,399
um and we could see again that high

224
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,478
concentration those cloudy tricomes

225
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,478
there again that camera does a really

226
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:52,959
good job of really zooming in and

227
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,079
allowing you to see what I can see

228
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,878
through a loop but to convey it to you

229
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,719
here on an image and then lastly here

230
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,199
these are the first ambers being see

231
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,080
this be the Harvest point we could see

232
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,280
that here and here and this really

233
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,839
indicates that probably this would be

234
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,318
the best time or the optimum time um to

235
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:10,038
harvest when you just just start the

236
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,319
first go in Amber if you're starting

237
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,120
with a new variety go ahead and um

238
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,800
Harvest at this time can Harvest some a

239
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,120
little earlier a little bit later and

240
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,520
pretending what compounds you're looking

241
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,280
for that may indicate your exact time of

242
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,478
harvest we looking for a general

243
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,598
recommendation you see a first couple

244
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:28,800
start to turn Amber Harvest it um and

245
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:30,560
use that as your gauge Point uh going

246
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,479
forward hopefully this helped you with

247
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,038
some real world images to see triome

248
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,240
development share with you with some of

249
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:40,000
the students had grown um and hope you

250
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,000
appreciated those images
