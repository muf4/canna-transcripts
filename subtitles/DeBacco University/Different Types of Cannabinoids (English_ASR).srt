00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,200
going to provide you with a brief

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,679
overview of some different types of

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,400
cannabinoids found in cannabis plants

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,558
as well as at the end to give you some

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,199
direction as far as some other detailed

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,838
videos

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,679
that go into some specific cannabinoids

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,359
to provide you with more information

10
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,000
on those particular ones if you have

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,000
interest in those

12
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:29,919
[Music]

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,678
all right so here we see a nice looking

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,480
uh canvas bud developing

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:33,759
and we're going to go through the

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,679
different types of cannabinoids that

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,679
this bud might be producing

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,280
so first off cannabinoids and chemicals

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,200
so research has found that

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,280
the cannabis plant produces between 80

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,239
and 100 cannabinoids and about 300

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,239
non-cannabinoid-related chemicals the

23
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,280
two main cannabinoids are delta-9

24
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,640
thc as well as cannabidiol or cbd but

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,079
here we can see that there's a lot of

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,600
other things being produced in that

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,160
plant a lot of other pathways going

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
through

29
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,959
we're going to touch on some of them

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,120
here and provide you with more

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,840
information on some of the specifics

32
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,198
for cannabinoids in other videos so

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
first off thc versus

34
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,879
cbds are probably the two most famous or

35
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,559
most well-known

36
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,000
cannabinoids and the main difference

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,320
between these is that thc has

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,519
strong psychoactive effects meaning it

39
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,039
makes a person quote

40
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,158
high whereas cbd is thought to have

41
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,840
anti-psychoactive effects that controls

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,719
or moderates the quote high

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,560
caused by thc cbd is also thought to

44
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,280
reduce some other negative effects

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,640
that people can experience from a thc

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,000
such as anxiety

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,079
and here we see kind of potential

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,159
benefits and side effects of both

49
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,438
listed here kind of in a comparative

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,118
sense there to provide you with a little

51
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,559
bit more information

52
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,239
now keep in mind that when we're looking

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,680
at cannabinoids it is more than just

54
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,759
thc and cbd there's thcv there's

55
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,759
cbn there's cbc and there's a whole

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,000
bunch of other ones um as well

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
so just keep in mind that there are more

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,078
cannabinoids and we're going to explore

59
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,438
those in more details on other videos

60
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,438
if you're wondering what type of

61
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,919
academics we're going to get into well

62
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,199
through devaco university you search any

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,118
of these particular

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,840
titles or cannabinoids you should be

65
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,479
able to find more information a good

66
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,560
comparison

67
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
just to give you an idea of some of the

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,878
diversity that does occur within

69
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,479
cannabinoids

70
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,919
to allow you to find a little bit more

71
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,159
detailed information

72
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,159
if you're so seeking that
