1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,068
okay this is very short a video here

2
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:07,500
going over the central dogma biology

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:09,690
there's three main steps replication

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,279
transcription and translation this is

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:12,388
kind of give you an idea of the bigger

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,209
picture and put in all the parts

7
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:18,149
together so DNA can replicate that's

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,260
generating more DNA DNA can also go

9
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:21,179
through the process of transcription

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,679
where it's written differently and you

11
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:25,920
could think of this is DNA being written

12
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,629
as RNA it's being written differently

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,720
remember thymine is present in DNA

14
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:32,488
uracil in RNA and then translation we're

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,750
translating our RNA sequence is

16
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,509
something completely different in this

17
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,799
case at protein in this process here of

18
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:39,988
replication transcription and

19
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,218
translation is what's called the central

20
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:43,078
dogma of biology

21
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,689
you should be very familiar with each of

22
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,710
these terms here's a little bit more

23
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:51,959
detail for each DNA making more DNA is

24
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,230
in the B replication that's producing

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,390
identical copies and that's key for that

26
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,729
transcription is DNA being converted to

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,489
RNA and the opposite of that we call

28
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:05,459
reverse transcription going from RNA to

29
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:07,500
DNA some viruses may do this the

30
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,879
telomerase is at the end our chromosomes

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,959
go through this reverse transcription

32
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,739
and that's going from RNA to DNA

33
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:15,899
translation think of translating a

34
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,688
different language is the conversion of

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,189
RNA to a protein and remember that

36
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:22,500
reverse transcriptase is basically going

37
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:26,579
backwards typically we think of going

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,228
from DNA to RNA to a protein again a

39
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,349
central dogma here this presents it in a

40
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:33,328
slightly different format we can see the

41
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,819
same terms used replication

42
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,889
transcription translation in general

43
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,139
moving from DNA to RNA to a protein

44
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,359
there are special cases where we can

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,129
kind of skip certain steps on certain

46
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,750
viruses mayanna go backwards from there

47
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,089
might be a DNA base and I'm going to

48
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,819
make RNA so reverse transcription and

49
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,859
other things in the cell gene

50
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,618
expressions use of information in DNA to

51
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:58,859
direct the correction of proteins this

52
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:01,319
is a person's to take two stages one is

53
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,239
transcription tuning of the letters the

54
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,279
other is writing a transcription you're

55
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,949
actually writing in translation is

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,750
conversion to another language

57
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,729
nucleotide language two amino acids is a

58
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,860
way to think about that so we're going

59
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:16,289
from our DNA to our RNA

60
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,290
ultimately our protein and same things

61
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:22,709
shown here we have our double-stranded

62
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:24,659
DNA being transcribed to RNA and we know

63
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,849
that's RNA uracil and it's being

64
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,849
translated now to a sequence of amino

65
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,919
acids again it's a very short video in

66
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:35,340
the central dogma be familiar with the

67
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:37,379
various terms used such as replication

68
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,189
transcription and translation and

69
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:43,259
reverse we look here we also wanna keep

70
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:45,329
of the idea of the reverse transcription

71
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,340
so hopefully this makes a little bit

72
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,530
more sense be able to recognize these

73
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,289
terms and provide definitions for them

74
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,590
which we'll go into more detail in other

75
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,590
lectures
