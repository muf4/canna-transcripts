1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
so if you're searching for led lights to

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,318
potentially add to your growing area

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,680
here at tobacco university i want to

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:10,240
compare some

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:17,920
common led lighting options in relation

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,920
to cannabis production

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,359
so let's get into comparing led lights

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,198
for cannabis production

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,279
so first off the disclaimer i have not

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,039
received any financial compensation for

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,039
writing the following product review

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,239
my parents my opinions are provided so

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,320
take them for what they

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,599
are worth so as a standard for

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,359
comparison we'll be looking at the

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,879
falling lights are all full spectrum

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,799
which is the led lights i feel are the

18
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,159
best for cannabis plant production

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:45,679
for each grow light i'll be providing

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:49,038
the good the bad and recommendations

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:52,679
so first up is the gavita ct 1930e

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,160
780 watt light ppf of

23
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:59,198
1930 micro moles per second output

24
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,119
for more crop loving uh light up to 20

25
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,320
eight energy savings versus a thousand

26
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,518
watt double ended

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,719
hps fixture fits the traditional hps

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,000
layout it's very

29
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,039
uh efficient with the efficacy of 2.5

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
moles

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,880
per second per watt the bad is that it

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,640
isn't expensive

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,158
and it's limited light distribution

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,680
because it's all these leds are in a

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,840
relatively small area

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
it's best utilized when lighting a large

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,840
area is not the main

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,798
goal now advantages again is that it

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,079
doesn't have any

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,520
fans it does have cooling fins above it

41
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:37,359
another light here by gavita is their

42
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:40,158
1700 e generation 2 645 watt light

43
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,879
it does produce 1 700 micromoles per

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,478
second

45
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,560
a fixture results in an impressive

46
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,280
efficiency of 2.6 micromoles

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,759
per second per watt this causes a

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,359
reduced in hvac cost of 30 to 40 percent

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,799
when compared to your traditional metal

50
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,799
headlight or high pressure sodium grow

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,600
lights

52
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,880
ip660 wet rating and is ul

53
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,679
8800 compliant for use in wet

54
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,438
environments

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,719
the bad it's wide design may restrict

56
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,239
its mounting options

57
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,239
it's best used when trying to evenly

58
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,000
light a large area so you want to keep

59
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,280
that large relative structure

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,800
level as well the last one here to

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,560
mention again is just a very brief

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,520
overview would be the fluence

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,719
viper 2x and 2p these are full spectrum

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
that have been researched specifically

65
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,400
for canvas production

66
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,799
the downfall is of course the cost is

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,719
some of the higher in the industry

68
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
overall it offers the best of both

69
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,840
worlds

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,280
and there is high par option for those

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,800
who will be using the light in a carbon

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,318
dioxide enriched environment

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,480
but really i would favor the full

74
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,119
spectrum in this option so if i was the

75
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,079
only to pick

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,039
one of these i tend to favor the fluence

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,800
and i actually have

78
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,400
the plants here in the picture under

79
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,719
fluence light the viper

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
2x note that the 3x is not a full

81
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,199
spectrum so i

82
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,878
prefer the 2x for example this seems to

83
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,759
fit most growing situations well

84
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,359
offers growers grower friendly options

85
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,479
however gavita is becoming a seriously

86
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,519
competitor recently

87
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,359
so it is a worthy comparison there

88
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
again the led market is constantly

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,599
changing so you want to use these only

90
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,919
as a source of general comparison

91
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,119
and then make the best decision for what

92
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,199
light is going to fit

93
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,200
your particular growing conditions
