1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,560
while there may be many consumers of

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,960
cannabis here at debaco university the

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,359
goal

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,480
is to make you an informed cannabis

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,080
consumer

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,839
so here in this video lecture we're

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,320
going to go over just that to allow you

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,920
to be

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,920
an informed consumer here

10
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:24,719
[Music]

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,039
all right let's go through the steps you

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,160
need to being an informed cannabis

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,400
consumer

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,839
so first off if not provided request it

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,039
what's that referring to

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,799
well if they're not provided the

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,238
information you need to reach your

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,718
requests and the information that you

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:38,558
need

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,239
so you want to ask for results from the

21
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,039
original analytical report

22
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,919
or the original certificate of analysis

23
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,759
so this is when you're looking at

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,239
purchasing cannabis it's great to see a

25
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,558
label

26
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,238
that's uh but we want to also be getting

27
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:50,878
and requesting if it's not provided to

28
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,279
us

29
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,878
that analytical report what's the

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,399
integral report kind of tell us well it

31
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,960
is going to tell us potential

32
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
thc levels this is the main cannabinoid

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,840
associated with cannabis

34
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,679
some growers are looking for the highest

35
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,760
levels possible while others

36
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,438
are concerned about the thc levels in

37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,359
their plants to maintain

38
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,519
federal compliance to be classified as

39
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,400
hemp so a lot of growers are concerned

40
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,879
with thc

41
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,400
and it's not necessarily just the most

42
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,759
thc possible

43
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,000
then the other cannabinoid of great

44
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,359
interest is usually cbd

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,118
and this cannabinoid also is also a

46
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,359
focus with many growers

47
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,719
with many looking for high levels for

48
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,640
medical benefits

49
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,280
and also to maintain classification as

50
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,400
hemp while keeping their thc level below

51
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,200
0.3 percent so what classifies it as

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,320
marijuana or hemp would be that tc level

53
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,920
above or below that 0.3 percent however

54
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,758
for the true medical benefits a lot of

55
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
growers are looking at reading as high

56
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,759
of a cbd percentage as possible while

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,719
still keeping that thc level

58
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,640
below that federal limit then we get

59
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,158
into organic certified

60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
cannabis you know why don't we see a lot

61
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,000
of organic certification with cannabis

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,759
well if you're looking for a certified

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,718
organic canvas pretty much you're not

64
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,879
going to find it

65
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,959
organic approaches can be used but

66
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,839
certifying a crop as organic requires

67
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,399
federal standards

68
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,360
and these are not written for cannabis

69
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,239
so again again

70
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
organic growing practices organic yes

71
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,039
it's possible but not

72
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,640
certified organic at a federal level

73
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,479
so we get to indoor or outdoor

74
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,799
production which one should i be looking

75
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,959
which one is quote unquote better

76
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,400
many consumers consider the indoor grown

77
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,479
cannabis to be of higher

78
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,080
quality than outdoor grown indoor

79
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,280
production typically yields a better

80
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,879
looking flower

81
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,479
and one with higher cannabinoids

82
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,679
compared to outdoor production

83
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,439
so your indoor production with your

84
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,120
controlled environment artificial lights

85
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,079
good air circulation

86
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,959
can really produce high quality product

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,280
compared to the

88
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,719
outdoor growing however this is because

89
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,080
of the degree of those environmental

90
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,080
controls an indoor

91
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,160
grower has compared to the outdoor

92
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
environment now this does not mean one

93
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,680
is better than the other

94
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,158
the goal is to look at the in the

95
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,680
analytical report provided

96
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,199
and determine the quality of the canvas

97
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
flower based on that

98
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,719
not necessarily the indoor or outdoor

99
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,759
growing nature what does the analytical

100
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,359
report say

101
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,120
now keep in mind your outdoor growing

102
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,360
will have more

103
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,280
variability a bit more inconsistencies

104
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
may not look quite as perfect as an

105
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
indoor growing

106
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,599
as it's a factor of the environment but

107
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,640
really we should be looking at the

108
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,639
the report of the cannabinoids of the

109
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,759
terpenes to really determine the quality

110
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,399
of the flower

111
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,239
not necessarily the environment that it

112
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,760
was produced in

113
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,920
now that this brings us to that proper

114
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,719
testing and that importance of

115
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,479
the proper testing so these analytical

116
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,439
reports are very important for cannabis

117
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,119
dry flour

118
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,560
as well as other products from a

119
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,878
grower's standpoint

120
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
it allows the for a certification of

121
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,158
your final product

122
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,919
and if you're a consumer from standpoint

123
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,318
it allows for the knowledge of the

124
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,958
product to be purchased is clean

125
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,238
of potential contaminants with what is

126
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,878
actually in the flower

127
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,158
when i say clean we're referring to the

128
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,560
example of

129
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,798
passing for example the pesticide test

130
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
the heavy metal test

131
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,480
things of that nature aflotoxins want to

132
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,319
make sure we're having a

133
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,598
pure product clean product that we're

134
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,719
not going to have any contaminants that

135
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,679
are going to be ingested

136
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,319
in the consumption process now we want

137
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,840
to request

138
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,040
lab results what's part of making you an

139
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,319
informed consumer well if you're not

140
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,120
provided with the information to be

141
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,560
informed

142
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,959
you need to then seek that information

143
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
out yourself testing is required by

144
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,638
cannabis dry flour as well as other

145
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,199
products so if not directly provided to

146
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,319
you

147
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,520
you can and you should be requesting for

148
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,040
that information

149
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,719
a product label is a good start as we

150
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,080
can see here this is a great start

151
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,000
but you really want the original

152
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,560
analytical report

153
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,240
now that label is great for comparison

154
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,439
looking at one versus another and kind

155
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,280
of doing comparison that way

156
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,560
the reason why you want that original

157
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,918
analytical report

158
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,319
is it's going to give you some more

159
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,680
information the numbers should be the

160
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,719
same so what's the difference if you're

161
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,079
comparing your numbers here to your

162
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,880
numbers on the label they're going to be

163
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,639
the same

164
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,399
so why go through the trouble of asking

165
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
for this analytical report

166
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,679
well you want to have such details as

167
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,279
the report date the date it was

168
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,918
collected the lab id the product

169
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,399
description

170
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,399
and the lab name all these will help

171
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,000
ensure the test results match

172
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,599
the lot for the product you're looking

173
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,319
