1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,980
now here were to look at drip irrigation

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,540
in injector options for fertilizer so

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,460
this is an example of a field that I set

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,550
up here with drip irrigation is about

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,980
10,000 square feet and this is a mini

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,618
dose which is a fertilizer injector with

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,109
a filter here allowing me to Freddie

8
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:19,559
gate this entire area if I choose to do

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,650
so

10
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,179
so the drip irrigation in injector well

11
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:26,669
the drip tapes allow for efficient

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,829
watering and low evaporation percentage

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,289
mainly because it's coming in direct

14
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,570
contact with the soil the injector

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,789
allows for precise nutrient application

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,808
so we see here another example here

17
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:38,549
we're having the bucket where the

18
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,799
concentrated fertilizer would be added

19
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,979
and as the water passes through it will

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,128
then be added with a very precise amount

21
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:48,029
that can be calculated of a fertilizer

22
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:50,339
now the drip tapes come in different

23
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,289
thicknesses if you are standardize your

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,910
rows the thicker can be more

25
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,270
cost-effective because you can use it

26
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:59,968
over multiple years 6 mil is considered

27
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,829
one season use and it's typically used

28
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,338
under plastic mulch and as minimum

29
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,840
insect resistance as it can break down 8

30
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:08,849
mil is commonly used for vegetable crops

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,170
and that's also commonly used for one

32
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,719
season but it's a little bit thicker

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,700
just a little bit tougher 10 mil is used

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,209
in heavy rocket areas where crops can

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,609
overwinter

36
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:21,780
the strawberries and the 15 mil will

37
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:24,000
give you multi year use there now drip

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,769
tapes of different flow rates and in

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,750
litter spacings that allow you to

40
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,640
customize it for your application this

41
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,920
can determine the feet of tape you can

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,960
run at once or you can adjust the tapes

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,340
in flow rate to match your gallons per

44
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,739
minute of the equipment you're allowed

45
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,030
to supply so do you have a large pump

46
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,209
you can supply a lot of water very

47
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,739
quickly or do you have a lower flow pump

48
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,319
that you need to apply it in a more

49
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:48,478
gentle sense so this is just one example

50
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,429
you can pause the video here to look at

51
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,200
some of the details but what this

52
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,939
basically comes down to is this gives

53
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,270
you the situations I'm assuming a 12

54
00:01:53,938 --> 00:02:00,179
inch emitter spacing per 100 feet at 8

55
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,429
psi looking at 7 gallons per minute

56
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,320
that's what the pump can supply you want

57
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,680
to add about 400 gallons of water in

58
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,840
about 1,500 feet now there's two

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,450
examples of drip tape here this one

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,709
closed at 13 gallons per hour per 100

61
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:16,828
feet and it's in the flow

62
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,109
quicker at 27 gallons per hour 400 feet

63
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:21,209
so what it comes down to is order to

64
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:25,079
deliver that same 400 gallons of water

65
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:27,539
this example drip tape for nine 1,500

66
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:30,269
feet we need to run for two hours in

67
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:32,489
this case this drip tape flowing at a

68
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,579
quicker rate would only need to run for

69
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,930
one hour to get the same 400 gallons so

70
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,310
it takes a little bit of math kind of

71
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,599
going through and figuring it out it's

72
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,098
not that complicated

73
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,078
but this would be a good thing just to

74
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:44,759
kind of go over and determine what

75
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,459
constraints you have for your particular

76
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,489
system because that can impact what drip

77
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,870
tape and flow rate you repurchase now

78
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,609
the injector allows for the precise

79
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,469
amount of liquid fertilizer to be added

80
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:57,209
at the same time of the irrigation if

81
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:59,098
you're gonna irrigate anyway might as

82
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,829
well go through and have the option to

83
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:05,098
add some fertilizer to it dosatrons I'll

84
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:06,870
name brand I use mini dose

85
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,328
there's toast Maddox there's other

86
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,980
different types of injectors dosatron

87
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,560
though is used a lot in greenhouses and

88
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:15,328
the term you might have heard before the

89
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,310
injector can be used as needed and moved

90
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:19,620
to other zones in the field can be put

91
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,810
on a cart here it can bright a quick-fix

92
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,030
especially for growing potted plants or

93
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,219
even row crops just a good way to

94
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,310
supplement in fertilizer when you're

95
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:30,269
going to naturally irrigate anyway

96
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,000
lastly there's something called a mozzie

97
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,639
injector which is a less expensive

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,009
alternative to the dosatron or dose

99
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,599
Matic there's no moving parts that works

100
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,969
with a venturi effect so if you remember

101
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,789
carburetors it works on the same

102
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,978
principle where we have this little bit

103
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:49,789
of a squeeze here in restriction and

104
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,989
flow increasing the speed allowing the

105
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:54,298
water to be sucked up through the pipe

106
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:56,519
here you do lose pressure with this so

107
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,919
that is one drawback to it but there's

108
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,769
no moving parts it's very simple easy to

109
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,439
put in and just something else to

110
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:07,310
consider another way to be a fertig aid

111
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:07,310
for your cross
