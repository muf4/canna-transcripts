00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,599
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,599
going to go over some hand trimming

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,960
techniques tools and suggestions because

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,638
a lot of people get a start in the

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,759
industry in this area

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,759
so i want to provide you with a little

7
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,919
bit of background to exactly what hand

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,920
trimming is and give you some tips and

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
recommendations

10
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,079
[Music]

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,080
all right let's get into hand trimming

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,479
techniques and tools for cannabis

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,000
so first off hand trimming well hand

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,118
trimming is a process that allows for

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
attention to detail

16
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,479
and for each bud to be treated in a very

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,239
unique way

18
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:38,000
this allows the grower to best showcase

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,718
the bud through selective trimming

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,759
to help the bud show its best qualities

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,600
why do you want to go through and have

22
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,759
the best qualities being shown

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,120
despite this time consuming process the

24
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,640
end result can bring

25
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,320
top dollar to make the process

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
worthwhile in the long run

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
so as a result even though all these

28
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,639
individual people may have their own

29
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
special

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,160
a unique kind of way of trimming the

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,480
overall process is

32
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,679
to kind of showcase that bud in the best

33
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,719
way possible

34
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,159
to again so it can bring top dollar

35
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,000
now how do you go about this process

36
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,520
well step one you want to remove the fan

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,799
leaves now you want to cut away fan

38
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,079
leaves as this will aid in

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,920
air circulation during the drying time

40
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,118
this will also help reduce the chance of

41
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
disease developing because you're

42
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,599
getting allow allowing more air

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,118
circulation

44
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,199
we can see here the family is being

45
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,118
removed and the

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,560
kind of what remains is the actual buds

47
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,118
now this is here it's remaining on the

48
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,320
plant

49
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,640
here we're seeing it stacked on a

50
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,158
separate container now

51
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,680
next would be to remove the buds from

52
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
the actual branches so this is

53
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,799
pertaining to dry trimming and the buds

54
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,639
should be removed from the branches

55
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,479
after a few days of drying time

56
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,000
or a little bit longer depending on your

57
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,679
exact conditions

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
some length of supporting stem note

59
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,399
should be kept

60
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,719
and these buds will be transferred

61
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,478
directly to a container ideally with

62
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,319
minimal physical contact

63
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,719
some growers will take them directly off

64
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,319
the plant and transfer just the buds

65
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,759
other growers will take larger branches

66
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,359
down and trim them again

67
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,280
this method can be sometimes more

68
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,959
advantageous simply because it allows

69
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,560
you better manipulation

70
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,000
of that branch can be a little more

71
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,280
difficult when it's physically on the

72
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,118
plant to go through

73
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,199
but if you have a smaller operation this

74
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,318
would work just fine as well

75
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,439
then you want to fill your trimming

76
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,199
station so most growers prefer a tray

77
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,280
and some will add a special light or

78
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,759
magnifier to aid in the process

79
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
once you have a bud in hand you

80
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,560
typically want to start at the base

81
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,239
basically near the stem

82
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,159
and remove the small branches that may

83
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,039
exist a lot of times are known as like

84
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,519
crow's feet

85
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,199
down this lower portion here then

86
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,879
proceed to remove additional plant

87
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,359
material around the bud with attention

88
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,439
to detail favored over speed

89
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,640
some trimmers will even use different

90
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,800
scissors at various

91
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,159
levels of detail some use a certain set

92
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
to kind of go through remove some of the

93
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,719
leaves

94
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,239
and then a finer set to as they get

95
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,400
closer to that

96
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,159
core bud there the goal is to go

97
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
completely around the bud at least once

98
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,079
to ensure consistency and to inspect it

99
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,759
make sure you forget anything these

100
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,879
trays are really advantageous because

101
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,039
they allow

102
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,799
a great place to kind of rest your uh

103
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,400
rest your arms there

104
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,879
and they're very ergonomic so they're

105
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
very um kind of grower friendly so you

106
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:09,280
want to make sure or trimmer friendly

107
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
because you want to make sure you're

108
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,719
comfortable

109
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,400
during this process now the equipment

110
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,000
that you might need to have around would

111
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
be of course the scissors comfortable

112
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
sitting location a clean tray indoor

113
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
surface cleaning supplies and it's an

114
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,560
optional light or magnifier

115
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
depending on your comfort or the room

116
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,719
that you're in

117
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,799
so we're looking at the trimming

118
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,639
scissors they're sharp

119
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,799
sterilized scissors are essential to any

120
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,399
trimming process while each trimmer may

121
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,920
have their exact preference

122
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,599
the goal is to get down to these

123
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,559
agronomic scissors that have a

124
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,439
comfortable grip

125
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,840
and this is where you're paying more uh

126
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,759
maybe

127
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
might be better now some prefer kind of

128
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,439
the encapsulated kind of grips here some

129
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,840
just prefer the straight handles

130
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,280
doesn't matter whichever you prefer

131
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
someone you should be getting

132
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,239
if you're going to be trimming for long

133
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,239
periods of time be sure to get scissors

134
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
you can find that are comfortable

135
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,680
and comfortable to you not because

136
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
someone else recommended it

137
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,719
some growers get some different types of

138
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,679
scissors to ensure that they can have

139
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,400
the proper tool

140
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,599
for the different detail pruning that

141
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,280
bud may require

142
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,679
others can go through and just use the

143
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,719
same set keep in mind that some might be

144
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,239
very very small

145
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,840
on the trimming end and that's great for

146
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,120
that detail work but to

147
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,759
initially remove those leaves might be

148
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,680
wiser to have a slightly larger blade

149
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
length to your scissors

150
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,120
now as i mentioned comfortable sitting

151
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,399
location that's comfortable for you or

152
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,079
the person doing the trimming

153
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,359
this does not have to be complex but

154
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,159
should be comfortable for you or the

155
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,680
trimmer

156
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,199
getting the chair and table heights

157
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,120
adjusted in space are

158
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,319
very important and depending on the

159
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
exact table that you're using your

160
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,120
environment

161
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,799
change but make sure again it's a

162
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,399
comfortable chair and location that

163
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,439
you're going to be in

164
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,799
in a clean tray and surface so many

165
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,120
different types of trimming trays

166
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,280
but all have the same purpose watch the

167
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,160
color as this can be your background as

168
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,559
your trim

169
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
some may like a you know more stainless

170
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
steel approach

171
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,038
something like a green approach there's

172
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,639
black backgrounds white backgrounds

173
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,240
uh just keep in mind as you're trimming

174
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,280
you're gonna be looking at that in the

175
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
background

176
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,319
black can be preferred as it does create

177
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,280
good contrast

178
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,120
others prefer more of a green color so

179
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,159
again just take that into consideration

180
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,840
if you have that option and as i

181
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,520
mentioned cleaning supplies

182
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,679
so this can involve those sterilizing

183
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,639
agents as well as resin cleaners from

184
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
the blades

185
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,478
the goal is to have one of these on hand

186
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
the second goal is to actually use them

187
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,599
some cores will just trim trim trim and

188
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,079
then kind of guys you're getting later

189
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,919
and later it's getting harder and harder

190
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,279
take a time give the blades a quick

191
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,439
little kind of clean there

192
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,879
make the process easier make your

193
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,038
details much sharper

194
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,399
and hopefully produce a higher quality

195
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,800
end product

196
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,799
and then lastly optional equipment would

197
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,960
be a light and magnifier

198
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,560
this can be grower microwave dependent

199
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,478
but some prefer to have an

200
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,680
external light source this as this can

201
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,199
depend on the room

202
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,160
if you're in a very dark room external

203
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,120
light source would definitely be

204
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,639
recommended

205
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,160
and a magnifier will allow the most

206
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,720
precise cuts to be made

207
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,319
as the bud is being manicured some come

208
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,880
with this nice light and magnifier

209
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,160
option

210
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,600
which is great you're going through and

211
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,720
trimming you're able to see it in much

212
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,479
more detail

213
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,319
particularly for spending long hours as

214
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:12,959
you can see here maybe have some coffee

215
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,039
nearby

216
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,038
sterilizing equipment it just shows the

217
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:17,839
very basics that a trimming station can

218
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:18,879
include

219
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,119
and the ones that you should be

220
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,519
considering so you have a very efficient

221
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,199
operation as you go through and trim

222
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,198
your final end product
