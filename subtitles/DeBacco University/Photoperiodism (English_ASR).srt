1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,068
okay here we're gonna investigate the

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,429
topic of photoperiodism what this is is

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:10,800
the impact that day length can have on

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,259
the flowering of plants we have certain

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,120
plants that are called short day plants

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,039
the certain ones called long day plants

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,788
we're going to investigate what causes

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,289
plants to flower and when well first off

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,720
the purpose of flowering just in the

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,060
general sense is the goal is to allow

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,649
the plants to reproduce this needs to

12
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,809
happen in sync with pollinators plants

13
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,299
want to be in sync with their

14
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:35,129
pollinators because if they're not then

15
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,808
this bees neck Fila transferred the

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,690
pollen in that individual will not be

17
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:42,149
able to survive point city of plants and

18
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,399
chrysanthemums are short-day plants with

19
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,429
ports a is requiring even longer nights

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,530
or when thing about is shorter days to

21
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,840
flower this is why typically we see

22
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,590
these grown and producer vibrant colors

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,449
in the winter time lilies for example

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,550
hour long day plants and a farm this

25
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:01,829
spring as Ned shorten in the days of

26
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,170
lengthen let's investigate these short

27
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,868
and long day plants a little bit more so

28
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,849
the first part is well plants are being

29
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:11,129
able to perceive this long and short

30
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,500
days well how do they tell time well

31
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:14,489
they have two different ways

32
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,739
phytochromes our leaf pigments and

33
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:20,250
enable plants to sense light in dark

34
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,989
periods this helps the plant determine

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,180
the photoperiodism which is plant's

36
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:25,140
response to the length of light in

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,000
darkness

38
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,650
now the phytochrome system is a

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,078
biologically inactive form of the

40
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,478
fenachrone where PR is converted to the

41
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,089
biologically active form called pfr as

42
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,158
we see here under illumination with a

43
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,409
red light far red light and darkness

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,329
converted smelling back to the inactive

45
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,579
form so what does this mean well first

46
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:47,339
off our red light is referring to light

47
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:49,500
that's kind of beyond the 700 nanometers

48
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,710
we're kind of getting out of the area

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,349
where we can see normal visible light

50
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:59,188
and a little bit of lower of energy too

51
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:02,819
so this active form in periods of

52
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:05,069
darkness will transfer over into the P R

53
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,889
which is the inactive form now we can

54
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:10,228
use far red light to help make that

55
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,840
process go quicker or we can use red

56
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:16,330
light to help create an inactive

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,909
to an active form very quickly these

58
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,750
changes is initiating this in cellular

59
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:24,699
response so let's like this again here

60
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,289
are four other crumbs in particular they

61
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:28,929
have both the active inactive form

62
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:31,209
remember the inactive form is the PR and

63
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,689
it's converted into the active form one

64
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:36,909
absorbs red light we see here here's our

65
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:39,549
inactive PR for absorbing red light

66
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,739
particularly the 660 nanometers convert

67
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:44,319
to PFR the active form of the

68
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,299
phytochrome the PFR is broken down into

69
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,389
the inactive form one absorbs the red

70
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:53,560
light we see here for a quick version or

71
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:55,419
the active form can gradually revert

72
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,810
back to the inactive form in the absence

73
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:01,719
of light or that darkness period so this

74
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,479
transfer that occurs here this slower

75
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:07,840
version back to the inactive is how

76
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:10,000
plants can help tell the length of night

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,979
that occurs this is how again how they

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,539
tell time we can trick them with

79
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:16,988
different lights but naturally when the

80
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:19,120
Sun sets our active pfr s are slowly

81
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,219
going to convert to PRC an active form

82
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,420
the plant will simply measure this and

83
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:27,009
be able to tell how long it's been night

84
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:30,189
so one key important factor to all of

85
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:32,409
this is that plants class is short or

86
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:34,209
long day plants have the critical factor

87
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:36,489
in determining activities night length

88
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,219
so while we kind of use the term short

89
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,409
day long day plants can only determine

90
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,719
the length of time of continuous and

91
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,969
darkness this is how they're tell any

92
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,680
time and this is an important aspect

93
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:51,939
because this can help influence or

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,700
impact plants abilities to sense the

95
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:56,439
length of the quote day really they're

96
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,810
only able to determine the length of

97
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,848
night so way to think about this is as

98
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,519
soon as the Sun sets plants start a

99
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:05,409
stopwatch and as soon as they see light

100
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,989
as soon as the Sun rises they stop that

101
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:10,479
stopwatch and they look at that amount

102
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:12,519
and they're able to then tell whether

103
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,068
the short day or a long day but they're

104
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,069
only able to tell the length of

105
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:19,209
continuous darkness so let's put this in

106
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:21,069
a graphical form I'd be a little bit

107
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,689
easier to understand here so looking at

108
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:25,120
our short day plants they flower when

109
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:27,009
days are short the way the thing about

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,740
this is if days are short well the night

111
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:30,050
period is

112
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,780
we call the critical length so here's

113
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,870
our short day plant we see that thing

114
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:38,538
night was short okay meaning a long day

115
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,550
plants do not flower the short day

116
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:42,818
plants pfr inhibits flower and hence

117
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,319
flower requires low levels of pfr

118
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:46,759
resulting in long nights here's our

119
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,819
critical length and here's our long

120
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,250
night now that long night equates to a

121
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:53,870
short day in the plant will flower

122
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,970
because the night time or the length of

123
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,430
night the length of continuous darkness

124
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,440
was greater than the critical link where

125
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,519
it gets a little confusing here is where

126
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,990
we have a long night

127
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,689
but in the middle for whatever reason we

128
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,000
have a flash of light we notice the play

129
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:10,029
doesn't flower during this time this is

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,098
because plant seen a long day of

131
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:14,658
uninterrupted night light as I said

132
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,310
remember plants have a stopwatch they

133
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:18,529
see darkness they started the stopwatch

134
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,079
Oh light comes in they stop that

135
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:22,250
stopwatch and they look at the time oh

136
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,439
so what's the critical length and they

137
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,899
restart again and they count again oh

138
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:29,180
and they look at again they stop it nope

139
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:31,698
not long enough they won't flower it's

140
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:35,598
not a summation in total they need to

141
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:37,189
have continuous hours of darkness and we

142
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:39,019
see that evident here that continuous

143
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:41,209
hours of darkness is greater than the

144
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,918
critical length no flower here we have

145
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:45,168
that little burst of light and that's

146
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:47,629
causing them not to flower because each

147
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:50,198
of these parts is less than the critical

148
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:53,120
length so in this case they don't flower

149
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:57,978
short day plants really mean long night

150
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,360
plants these short day plants require

151
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:01,430
periods of darkness to be greater than

152
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,080
the undirected critical period these

153
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,879
plants tradition will not flower during

154
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,918
the summer months when night lengths are

155
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,168
short what a culture so can trigger

156
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:11,120
flowering in these plants by covering

157
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:13,639
the plants with an opaque black cloth

158
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,740
for about 12 hours criticisms are an

159
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,259
example of this everyone wants them to

160
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,300
bloom at the right time

161
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:22,520
so what botanist can do is simply block

162
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,579
out the light causing the night to be

163
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:28,068
longer in this case and causing them to

164
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:29,508
flower this is in comparison to our long

165
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,729
date plants and see again that

166
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,439
comparison between the two and discuss

167
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:36,500
these now and hopefully provide a little

168
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:39,288
bit of an example between the two so our

169
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,879
long day plants they flower when days

170
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:42,740
are long or

171
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,290
we're a night period to be less than the

172
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,699
pinnacle life so we see that here night

173
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,879
length is shorter than the critical

174
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,439
period boom the flower here's our night

175
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,300
length longer than the critical period

176
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,819
they don't flower but what's interesting

177
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,259
here if you have that burst of light

178
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:01,790
again and what this has created now is

179
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:04,099
sections of continuous darkness to be

180
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,110
less than the critical night light and

181
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,750
those plants will actually flower during

182
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,939
that time so long day plans to PFR

183
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,399
activates flowering and hence flowering

184
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:15,439
repairs high levels of pfr these results

185
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,639
in the shortened nights again here we

186
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,379
have a long night we have that burst of

187
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,829
light in the middle and that can cause

188
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:23,480
the plant to flower kind of putting it

189
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:25,459
together hopefully this picture here

190
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,530
makes a little bit more sense those long

191
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:29,629
days week long day in plants require

192
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:32,000
periods of darkness to be less than the

193
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,709
uninterrupted critical length these

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,329
plates will traditionally not flower

195
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:37,549
during the winter and autumn ones when

196
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:40,099
night lengths are long for colors

197
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,660
control flowering in these clamps by

198
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,360
exposing the plant to a light source

199
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,430
during the night so we see that right

200
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,470
here we're imposing those plants

201
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,150
exposing those plants this bright light

202
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,180
in the middle of the night breaking

203
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:54,979
apart that continuous hours of darkness

204
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,100
causing the flower carnations are an

205
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,450
example a long day plant so again even

206
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,879
though they're listed as long day and

207
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:04,930
short day plants we want to keep in mind

208
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,579
that plants can only tell the hours of

209
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,350
continuous darkness and that's how

210
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:12,349
they're determining whether they flower

211
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:15,290
or not short day plants will flower

212
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,879
during periods of long night long day

213
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,129
plants will flower during periods of a

214
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,810
short night we can influence that with a

215
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:23,420
burst of light here we're breaking that

216
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,250
cycle in the short day plant and here

217
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,080
we're breaking that hours mutinous

218
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,500
darkness here with the burst of light

219
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,059
causing long day plants to flower and

220
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,929
suppressing flowering in short day

221
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:38,569
plants lastly we there's some things

222
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:40,189
called date neutral plants and these

223
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,870
plants will flower independently of a

224
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,810
photo period but they may require a

225
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,730
period of cold in some instances rice is

226
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:49,399
a prime example of what's called a day

227
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,800
neutral plant it will flower regardless

228
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,500
of a lengthening day a shortening day a

229
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,769
burst of light or not it is a private

230
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,539
sale

231
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,539
all of a day neutral player
