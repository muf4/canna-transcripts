1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
here we're looking at the dna

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,719
replication process

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,480
and while initially this might look like

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,320
a lot's going on and that's true

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,519
i'm going to break it down step by step

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,919
for you

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,719
so starting here with the basics of the

8
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,120
process

9
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,079
so dna is double stranded and it unwinds

10
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,000
and there's two

11
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,000
unwound strands and there's a

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,480
replication fork that's where the

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,240
two strands are initially divided and

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,320
these new strands are formed by pairing

15
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,239
complementary bases to the old

16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
strands we have that template strand

17
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,000
these complementary bases

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,679
uh being bound there to reduce the

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,719
chance for errors and make this very

20
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,799
efficient

21
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,160
in the end two molecules of dna we see

22
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,199
kind of at the end here are

23
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,319
create or made with each having one old

24
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,280
strand and one

25
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,200
new strand and this process is known as

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,039
being

27
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,920
semi-conservative replication

28
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,920
so how does dna copy itself well looking

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,320
back at that same image we saw at the

30
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,320
title slide dna helicase begins by

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,159
unwanting the nucleosomes we see here by

32
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,840
that little blue triangle

33
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,679
separating our double helix into

34
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,079
individual single strands

35
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,879
here the case untwists that double helix

36
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,519
and exposes those complementary strain

37
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,719
strands and the enzyme primase puts down

38
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,679
a short piece of rna

39
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,759
termed the primer keep in mind that rna

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,759
primer is kind of like the little flag

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,959
that says okay the dna polymerase are

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,118
going to start here

43
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,239
what dna's polymerase does is that reads

44
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:25,519
along each

45
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,359
single strand by adding the

46
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,359
complementary nucleotides

47
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,118
remember adenine binds with thymine a

48
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,319
binds with t and g binds with c

49
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:37,519
guanine with cytosine a

50
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,399
purine and a pyrimidine binding together

51
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,000
so this replication site may not does

52
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
not just occur in one area

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,040
this may occur in many areas and in fact

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,759
it does particularly for

55
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,200
eukaryotes each nucleotide strand serves

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,560
as a template building for the new

57
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,159
complementary strand

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,640
all these little bubbles will eventually

59
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,799
meet creating a replication

60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,000
of the original form of dna in a

61
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,399
semi-conservative

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,078
nature now the process of dna

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,799
replication can be summarized

64
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,599
as that helicase first unwinding that

65
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,439
dna

66
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,840
then the primase putting down that short

67
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,519
primer we can see the rna primer

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,120
located right here and polymerase

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,599
reading along and adding

70
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,000
in the complementary bases keep in mind

71
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,318
that polymerase only works in the five

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
to three prime direction as it's going

73
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,199
through so this is a leading strand

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,560
that we're focusing on here now this

75
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,119
replication process this is

76
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
evolving dna copied by a replication

77
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,680
machine that travels along the

78
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,280
replication fork

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
that's where helicase is initially

80
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,080
unwinding the dna

81
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,760
one of the most important members of

82
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
this complex is that polymerase because

83
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,039
that is the one responsible for adding

84
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,879
the nucleotides

85
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,878
it's able to add those nucleotides

86
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,199
creating and making that new

87
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,719
dna sequence and we see that here with

88
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,159
them binding together

89
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,159
now realize that there is not just one

90
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,680
dna polymerase there's kind of a complex

91
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,039
of dna polymerases

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,120
but for right now there's no dna

93
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,439
polymerase is going through and adding

94
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,360
in those complementary forms of

95
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,919
nucleotides

96
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
now that polymerase all the interface

97
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,439
have two properties

98
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,640
only synthesize dna in one direction at

99
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,639
five to three prime

100
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,479
direction so in the dna vocabulary video

101
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,639
i talked a little bit about that

102
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,878
it's looking at the number of carbon

103
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,039
atoms there's carbons

104
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,318
atoms number five and number three you

105
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,120
can only add

106
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,639
to that number three carbon area so it

107
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,959
can only work in the five

108
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,639
to three prime direction now initially

109
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,120
you might be looking at this image

110
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,878
going well if it could work in five to

111
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,319
three prime direction

112
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,120
well why is it right next to the three

113
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,719
prime dna is actually anti-parallel so

114
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,000
we look at this bottom sequence here

115
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,560
here's a three prime

116
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,400
the other end of it will be five prime

117
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
here we see a five prime the other end

118
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,039
of that sequence will be three prime

119
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,640
because it's going to be anti-parallel

120
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,158
meaning it can only work in the five to

121
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,479
three prime direction this is going to

122
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:56,158
be

123
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,238
our leading strand because it's going to

124
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,719
be working towards the replication

125
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
fork and then this would be our lagging

126
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,039
strand because it's working away

127
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,239
has to detach and reattach detach and

128
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,759
reattach

129
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,759
these little fragments are called

130
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,359
okazaki fragments you can see all the

131
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,679
kind of individual components labeled

132
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,599
here

133
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,719
a being our template strand this our

134
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,639
leading strand

135
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,759
this is an example of our lagging strand

136
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,959
our replication

137
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,160
fork and our rna primer would be this

138
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,519
little kind of red region

139
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,800
we see located here and here and i

140
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,599
remember that's a little flag that says

141
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,520
start here

142
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,120
we have our okazaki fragments here's one

143
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,639
kind of independently here

144
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,000
but they would be on that lagging strand

145
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,240
now of those polymerases as i said

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,839
there's a bunch of different ones

147
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
right now you can just kind of focus on

148
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,719
polymerase doing this one job but

149
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,879
realize there are

150
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,880
four types in humans and three types in

151
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
bacteria

152
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,240
now this polymerase has a proofreading

153
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,080
mechanism built in which is great to

154
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,478
reduce the chance of there being errors

155
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,079
and checks for base matching making sure

156
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,199
adding spinning with thymine glotting

157
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,000
with cytosine

158
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,919
it will remove mismatched bases by going

159
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,240
backwards and ensuring that

160
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,120
corrections are made as it reads along

161
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,519
and proofreads

162
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,280
that dna sequence because we do not want

163
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,758
mutations to occur

164
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,399
the reason why it's not able to bind in

165
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,120
the

166
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,560
three to five prime direction is there's

167
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,000
no energy from atp

168
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,399
hydrolysis so this is looking at

169
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,319
the reason why it only works in that

170
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,000
five to three prime direction it's only

171
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,319
going to be binding to that three prime

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,079
end because you're getting that kind of

173
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,079
phosphate binding

174
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,918
now dna polymerase does is not 100

175
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,719
percent full proof it does make one

176
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,240
error in about

177
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,520
every billion or so bases so that is

178
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,120
important to remember that mutations

179
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,038
will naturally be occurring

180
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,959
but hopefully they occur in a non-coding

181
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:46,159
region of the dna so there's not any

182
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,839
chance of negative effects and it's

183
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,560
using that template strand there to go

184
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,599
through and build

185
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,800
that new strand now dna copying itself

186
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,639
hopefully now this is making a little

187
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,400
bit more sense here we can see this

188
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,000
some of those same images it could only

189
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,279
bind and strain in the five to three

190
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
prime direction remember that polymerase

191
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,599
can only work in the five to three prime

192
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,240
direction

193
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
uh indicating this is our leading strand

194
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,199
the

195
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,879
um is made continuously with one rna

196
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,800
primer and goes right along

197
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,038
the lagging strand here because it's

198
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
starting and detaching and restarting

199
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,839
and restarting

200
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,918
those are the lagging strand and that

201
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,799
has those okazaki fragments

202
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,599
and that's created a it needs multiple

203
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
primers

204
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,039
because here it started and it worked

205
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,240
its way to the end and have to rebind

206
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,079
here and rebind here

207
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,519
well now helicase is here once this

208
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,560
finishes detaching here it's going to

209
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,560
come back through

210
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,720
create another fragment here this is

211
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,280
because it can only work in the five

212
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,720
to three prime direction here just five

213
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,559
to three prime no problem because as

214
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,759
helicase is separating it's got a three

215
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,160
prime end right here it's adding the

216
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,639
next nucleotide adding next nucleotide

217
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,639
no problem this side a little bit more

218
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,840
of these fragments and ligase will be

219
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
needed to come in and bind those

220
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,598
together

221
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
now how nucleotides are added in that

222
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,879
three a five to three prime direction

223
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,720
they're only added to that three prime

224
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,000
uh remember they can only be added to

225
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,199
that three prime end

226
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,959
so here we see that three primeknits

227
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,280
where they can be added and built going

228
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,198
on

229
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,799
this way this is going away from the

230
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
replication fork and that's why this is

231
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,439
our

232
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,280
lagging strand and creating okazaki

233
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,918
fragments

234
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,959
so what happens at the lagging strand

235
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,120
well

236
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,560
okazaki saw one strand made continuously

237
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,160
determine that deleting strand and then

238
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,680
the other is that lagging strand

239
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,680
there's these discontinuous little

240
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,759
pieces known as these okazaki

241
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,759
fragments at least initially during the

242
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,199
replication process

243
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,800
during that replication process since

244
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,919
dna planets only works in that five to

245
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,120
three prime direction

246
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,359
continuously leading strain to

247
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,478
synthesize and this discontinuous

248
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,120
lagging strand

249
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,240
therefore we need dna ligase to splice

250
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,680
together these short

251
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,000
segments to create a continuous strand

252
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,280
of

253
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
dna at the end result and here's that

254
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,918
ligase going right through and just

255
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
binding them all together making sure

256
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,038
everything's

257
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,038
nicely fit together and stable so that

258
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:59,759
we don't have any breakage of the dna

259
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:01,439
in the newly replicated sequence here

260
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,598
rna primer is removed and replaced with

261
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,719
that dna to help bind everything

262
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,800
together so that there's

263
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,199
no evidence of what strand was the

264
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,840
leading in lagging strand at the end

265
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,038
ligase is the one that joins those

266
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,799
together and there is remember those

267
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,719
mechanisms for proofreading the dna to

268
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,000
reduce the chance of there being errors

269
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,639
no one occurs about every billion bases

270
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,279
so that dna replication new telomeres

271
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,120
are added

272
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,038
which are at the very end caps kind of

273
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,598
at the end of dna and they kind of

274
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,800
act as protective areas to those

275
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,240
chromosomes

276
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,759
this end getting of anything kind of

277
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,320
being at the end of a chance of being

278
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,000
damaged

279
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,839
this reduces the chance of damage

280
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
occurring to the central core

281
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,680
genome so simple animation of dna

282
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,360
replication we can see here his heel

283
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,159
case being the key that's separating it

284
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,720
out

285
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,879
we're going through we have our leading

286
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,160
strand going right along in the five to

287
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,600
three prime direction

288
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,519
we can see these little okazaki

289
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,920
fragments being developed here going

290
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,679
backwards and ultimately everything's

291
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,958
kind of being put together we see those

292
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,879
phosphate groups

293
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,479
again this one's the lagging strand we

294
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,480
have so we have ligase has to come

295
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,080
through and bind these together

296
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,920
and our leading strand going right along

297
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,000
the way lagnestry and binding those

298
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,278
okazaki fragments together

299
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,240
and ultimately what we'll have is a full

300
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:23,039
set of dna replication we had one

301
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,039
double helix strand now we have two
