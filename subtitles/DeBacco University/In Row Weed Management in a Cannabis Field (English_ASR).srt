in this debaco university video this is

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,919
going to cover the three main options

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,559
when looking at

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,320
in-row weed management for a cannabis

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,678
field and that's looking down our rows

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
how you're going to best manage the

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,640
weeds growing in between your plants

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,839
within the row stay tuned here to find

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,359
out the three methods

10
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,210
as well as the advantages and

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:29,359
disadvantages of each

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:30,960
[Music]

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,200
all right let's get into in-row weed

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,200
management in a cannabis field

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
so first off of our three options

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,280
plastic mulch is the first one

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,520
the advantages here is that it's very

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,160
easy to get it's effective for most

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,760
weeds

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,839
and there are color options for

21
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,558
different situations some of those color

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,160
options may offer some advantages

23
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,000
disadvantages with plastic mulch is the

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,439
initial setup process

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,359
it can be kind of labor intensive or

26
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,479
require special equipment and also at

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,558
the end of the season

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,919
the disposal of the plastic mulch can

29
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,959
also present an issue

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,400
to those growers another option might be

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,239
biodegradable mulches

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,320
the advantage is here is that there's

33
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,798
not really an end of the season disposal

34
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,118
issue

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,960
at least in most cases also

36
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,760
biodegradable mulches can work on

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,438
nutsedge

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,439
so if you have a nutsedge problem or

39
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,879
that weed really be presenting an issue

40
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,438
on your particular land

41
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,199
biodegradable mulches can offer a

42
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,239
advantage of being able to prevent that

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,320
from growing

44
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,920
however the disadvantages is that

45
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,199
selecting the one that is the best for

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,200
your growing conditions because there

47
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
are more options can be a challenge

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
and there's a potential increase in cost

49
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,000
when using

50
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,280
biodegradable mulches definitely at

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,920
least compared to the

52
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,478
plastic mulches and then lastly there's

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,560
just the

54
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,319
handled manual methods where the

55
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
advantage ensures someone will be

56
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,919
walking the fields and doing plant

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,960
inspections one of the disadvantages is

58
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,359
the simple the time

59
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,519
and labor that it takes to manually go

60
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,280
through and manage the weeds

61
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,039
now looking at these three different

62
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,280
methods if you

63
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,399
investigate any of them further look at

64
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,000
