1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,929
well this is entirely titled how

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,609
scientists think it's important to

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:07,410
realize that scientists do think a

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,449
little differently and I'll have their

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,359
different kind of ways to approach

6
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:14,419
things this is kind of how science is

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,919
thinking or how scientists approach

8
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:18,868
certain problems or issues and how that

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,179
kind of can look so let's investigate

10
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,730
this little further so as scientists

11
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,278
same kind of two main ways we have

12
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,250
deductive reasoning which involves

13
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,618
telling stories based on patterns this

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,590
uses accepted general principles as a

15
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,979
guide to explain specific observations

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,230
it starts out more general and

17
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:42,558
progresses to become more specific the

18
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:45,538
example would be all humans are mortal

19
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:48,929
Albert Einstein is human therefore

20
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,750
Einstein is mortal using this deductive

21
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:53,759
reasoning pattern it's forming a general

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,558
theory of explanation based on specific

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,698
observations that have been made

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,320
previously deductive reasoning here

25
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:04,349
opposite this would be inductive

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,170
reasoning so what's in depth reasoning

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,688
well this is recognizing patterns this

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,170
uses by scientists develop hypothesis

29
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:15,539
about how the world works start with a

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,969
specific observation and progresses to a

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,100
broader generalizations and theories

32
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,769
again what's an example of how this may

33
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,959
look well poll shows that 75% of

34
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:25,548
students at school X take the bus to

35
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,828
school

36
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,420
harren goes to school apps therefore

37
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,879
Aaron probably takes the bus to school

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,129
this is an example of inductive

39
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,500
reasoning making a specific prediction

40
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:40,259
based on a general principle believed to

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,688
be true inductive reasoning so how do

42
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,780
these kind of two compare well if you

43
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:48,929
look above here we can see that the

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,659
deductive reasoning for general

45
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,350
principles inductive reasons based more

46
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,450
on observations now for conclusion wise

47
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:00,478
conclusion is more special than

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,399
information and premise provide this is

49
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,200
reached directly by applying logical

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,930
rules to the Pradas that's deductive

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,819
reasoning inductively knows these more

52
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,379
general information that the premise

53
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,759
provides it's reached by a

54
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,169
generalization of the premise of

55
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,389
information

56
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:17,489
validity and deductive reasoning it must

57
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,019
be true for India the reasoning it's

58
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,270
probably true as we saw the example

59
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,819
there was 75 percent of students taking

60
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,250
the bus so we're assuming it's probably

61
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:28,229
true that Aaron takes the bus because we

62
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,959
have 75 percent of students taking the

63
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:34,289
bus lhasa first usage deductive

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,479
reasoning is using one leads facts that

65
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:38,729
are definitely true in that the reason

66
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,789
using evidence instead of proven facts

67
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:43,859
helps support that conclusion that's

68
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:46,319
reached so just a quick comparison

69
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,690
between deductive and inductive

70
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,879
reasoning which is you'd see how

71
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:51,870
scientists intend to take a little bit

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,969
more of this inductive reasoning

73
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,159
approach now because we don't know

74
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,469
everything we can't be 100% sure of

75
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,819
everything that would be comment to the

76
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,819
deductive reasoning process
