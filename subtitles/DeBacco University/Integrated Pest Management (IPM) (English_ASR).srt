1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,220
so here we're looking at integrated pest

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,230
management which is abbreviated IPM this

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:09,739
is a great kind of summary here where

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,048
this involves this integration of

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,629
identifying and monitoring for casual

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:17,608
agents evaluating based on those

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,350
monitors or what's going on trying to

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,109
prevent some of the pest problems from

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,868
occurring taking action when needed and

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,000
then monitoring the end result to see if

11
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:30,719
any part of this needs to be repeated

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,179
again if IPM tools alter surroundings

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,070
you can disrupt insect behaviors keep in

14
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,808
mind that using pesticide is still a

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,850
part of integrated pest management this

16
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,828
doesn't mean that's null and void we try

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,530
to use other things that may be less

18
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,649
impactful on the environment as part of

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,910
this integration of managing of pests

20
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:49,649
now IPM involves the use of this

21
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,359
combination of methods to control pests

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,448
that results in minimizing environmental

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,859
impacts overall now chemical is used but

24
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:57,750
we're looking at prevention being kind

25
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,170
of the foundation then cultural

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,730
sanitation physical mechanical

27
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,948
biological controls and then chemical is

28
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,509
kind of like a last resort there now

29
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:09,539
this can be applied to buildings and

30
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,030
homes so we've had two farms and also

31
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,490
managed natural systems so this

32
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,469
incorporation of data to then gained

33
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,810
information and knowledge and applying

34
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,118
it to learning is a vital important

35
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,478
component of this integrated pest

36
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:27,269
management now what the guidelines are

37
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,859
for IPM is select I'm selected to

38
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,048
control which will cause the least

39
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,239
amount of impact untested natural

40
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,520
enemies the goal here is to get the same

41
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,589
end result we want but not really

42
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,199
impacting the environment in other ways

43
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,810
that we may not see as great as some

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,899
other chosen methods that might be

45
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,250
employed the controls used will have the

46
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,009
least potential harm to the environment

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,109
overall so we may want to control one

48
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,549
for example insect pest I want to make

49
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:56,728
sure the rest environment is as

50
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,680
minimally impacted as possible we call

51
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,989
these guidelines just as we see here you

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,939
see on TV shows because it gives you

53
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:05,280
just the general idea of what to expect

54
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,828
they can be specifically managed for

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,259
different pests were trying to control

56
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:12,120
now the usage of IPM involves using a

57
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,649
wide range of pest control strategies

58
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,599
making decisions require

59
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,760
good information there's many different

60
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,369
possibilities but the goal is to try to

61
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,128
have that proper diagnosis that

62
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,079
identification step is very important it

63
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:28,169
can allow for specifically targeted

64
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:29,370
ideas or strategies the plant and pest

65
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,559
characteristics are important

66
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,469
considerations as well to allow this to

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,390
be as specific as possible the goal is

68
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:38,340
to encourage the plant growth while

69
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,199
disrupting the plant growth in a

70
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,239
reproduction to kind of get the end

71
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,310
result we want with minimal impacts on

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,439
the environment

73
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,180
lastly the benefits of IPM is to promote

74
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,939
sustainable agriculture reduced

75
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,250
pesticide use overall unless the chance

76
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,259
of pesticide resistance what that means

77
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,969
is here we have before a pesticide

78
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,519
application of this first generation we

79
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:02,250
have a spray control after pesticide

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,569
application we see that many of the

81
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,299
insects were killed but there's always a

82
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:08,369
few that remain the next generation we

83
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,109
see an increase in their same number so

84
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,359
we take that same pesticide we apply it

85
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:13,889
well for whatever reason these red bugs

86
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,599
have resistance and we can see that

87
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,000
we're building or encouraging that

88
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,939
population essentially artificially

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,829
selecting for that population this is

90
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,789
using this one straight chemical we're

91
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,590
using this integrated pest management

92
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:27,328
the goals try to reduce this from

93
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,680
occuring reduce the potential

94
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,260
environmental contamination of a

95
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,049
pesticide reduce the residues on plants

96
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:37,229
and also lessen the chance of insects

97
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:39,030
developing this resistance to a

98
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:41,369
particular product so that we're

99
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,870
managing them in an effective way while

100
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,870
still maximizing plant growth
