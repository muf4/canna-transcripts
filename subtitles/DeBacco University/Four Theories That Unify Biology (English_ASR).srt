1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,089
okay as the title implies we're look at

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:08,250
the four theories that unify biology so

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,349
theory uncertainty in relation to

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,109
science the theory is a set of

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,379
hypotheses that have been tested many

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:18,300
times in that redirected this means it

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,670
indicates a high degree of certainty

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,150
however there's no absolute truth in

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,310
science

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,159
everything is open to more testing and

11
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:28,409
reinterpretation acceptance of a theory

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,390
is always provisional that to the

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,509
general public we use the word theory is

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,420
often used to mean what a scientist

15
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:39,269
would call a hypothesis a lack of

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,640
knowledge or a guess however two

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,129
scientists theory represents that of

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,750
which they are most certain explanations

19
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,479
support a wealth of evidence and

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,579
experimental data so when we use the

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,459
word theory the general public has kind

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,250
of a slate if the interpretation of it

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,628
then a scientist would so we want to be

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,530
careful when we look at some of these

25
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:03,329
theories such as cell theory and so on

26
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,489
and so forth that the general public

27
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,710
typically defines a theory a little bit

28
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,750
more like a scientist called a publicist

29
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:10,259
sometimes got a lack of knowledge or a

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,659
guess

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,380
the scientists though it's their most

32
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,359
certain explanations like 99% certainly

33
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:21,209
that's how it happens because of the

34
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,590
high degree of certainty related to all

35
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,408
the tests that have been done in no

36
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,820
rejections to those tests here's another

37
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,920
link to YouTube video if you want to

38
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,250
observe what's the difference between a

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,070
scientific law and a theory there so

40
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,959
limitations of science Sciences is

41
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:38,578
limited to organisms and processes that

42
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,429
can be observed and measured

43
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:44,699
there's also practical limits scientists

44
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,200
can prove options understanding say this

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,570
cannot be relied upon to solve all

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,549
problems for example what constitutes

47
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:52,618
acceptable risk cannot be answered by

48
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,649
science to get to that and we do sort of

49
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,450
experiments or evaluating certain things

50
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,329
so it's acceptable risk well sorry I

51
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,490
really can't answer that so getting to

52
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,188
the four theories the first one we're

53
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,259
gonna touch on here is gened theory the

54
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,840
information that determines what prison

55
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,989
is like is encoded in its genes genes

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,709
are located along DNA molecules

57
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:16,378
deoxyribonucleic acid

58
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:20,968
the entire set of DNA instructions that

59
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:22,858
specifies a cell is termed its genome so

60
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:26,639
while we pre-much accept this as fact

61
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:29,370
this actually is a explained through the

62
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:32,369
gene theory here again something that

63
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,680
sangd is there 99% choice is how it

64
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,750
works even though it's a theory again

65
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,290
not how the general public would define

66
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,560
theory the second theory is cell theory

67
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:46,408
all living organisms are composed of

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,158
cells cells are the basic units of life

69
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:52,769
all cells come from other cells so you

70
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:54,929
see here a cell's fighting I'm going

71
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,789
through all cells in this picture here

72
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,739
so initially we say all cells come from

73
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:01,108
other cells make sense right and see

74
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,519
cells dividing brings about the question

75
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:04,349
I was like where did the first cell come

76
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,700
from well for right now we're not gonna

77
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:09,780
get into that we're looking at the

78
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:11,878
general idea of cell theory moving on

79
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,098
the theory of heredity genes represent

80
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,798
traits of an organism and are inherited

81
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:19,048
as discrete units the chromosomal theory

82
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,510
of inheritance genes are physically

83
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:24,359
located on chromosomes we've done

84
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:26,189
punnett squares or looked at traits that

85
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,519
are inherited what's dominant what's

86
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:32,009
recessive this is all supported by the

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,109
theory of heredity it allows us to go

88
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:35,989
through and create these punnett squares

89
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:38,129
to determine the percentage or the

90
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,019
predicted percentage of offspring that

91
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:44,068
will be one certain genotype versus

92
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,840
another lastly the fourth theory that

93
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:48,030
unifies biology in this class the theory

94
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,680
of evolution all of the organs are

95
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,810
related to one another in the common

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,549
tree of life diversity of the living

97
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,859
world is a result of natural selection

98
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,919
we see that here with the different bird

99
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:01,199
beaks Darwin came up with all these

100
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,239
different birds at eat different food

101
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,859
items that weren't all competing may

102
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,378
have all stemmed from one common

103
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:10,139
ancestor they each developed certain

104
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:12,418
degrees of speciality so you didn't

105
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,189
catch all four of those theories here

106
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,400
they all are in one particular slide

107
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:19,918
here gene theory cell theory theory of

108
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,228
heredity and evolution and how they can

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,990
all tie it together in unified biology

110
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:27,110
in this class because this is a biology

111
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,110
class
