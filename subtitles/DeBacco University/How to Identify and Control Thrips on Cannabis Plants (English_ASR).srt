00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,119
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,839
going to go

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,240
over how to identify and control thrips

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:16,160
on

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:17,600
your cannabis plants

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,519
well if you've ever seen damage like

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,840
this on your leaves and flip it over and

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,000
look

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,439
very carefully you might find small

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,399
insects that look like this and these

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,679
are threps

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,518
in this video we're going to go over how

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,358
to identify them and control them on

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,000
your cannabis plants

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,600
so first off the description of thrips

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,238
we can just see kind of how small they

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,559
actually

18
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,759
are half a millimeter this bar size

19
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,439
really really small

20
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,119
there's at least two species of thrips

21
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,679
that are really associated with outdoor

22
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,839
grown

23
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,920
hemp the onion thrips and the western

24
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,480
flower thrips are considered to be

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,239
the two of concern onion thrips have

26
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,679
been shown to reduce yields and indoor

27
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,878
growing cannabis as well

28
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,198
so don't think if you're just growing

29
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,919
indoors you're free of this particular

30
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,238
pest

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,800
both are very small insects with an

32
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,159
elongated body typically about 1.2 to

33
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,198
1.5 millimeters

34
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:08,319
in length which is only about 1 15

35
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,759
of an inch in length very very small so

36
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,759
typically we're using kind of a loop to

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,840
kind of go through and identify them

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,759
this gives you an idea of zoomed in how

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,118
they look this is kind of your textbook

40
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,159
image of how they look

41
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,519
right here for identification purposes

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,359
now we're looking at kind of looking at

43
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,640
the plant itself well we're seeing this

44
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,239
kind of stippling here

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,079
of the leaves it's kind of like damage

46
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,000
almost like someone like rubbed a little

47
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,400
portion of that leaf off

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,078
sometimes the feces can also be seen in

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
small little black dots

50
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,399
and using blue sticky traps can help

51
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,039
make a positive identification

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,478
so here we're seeing blue being used

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
sometimes a little bit more advised over

54
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,039
yellow for certain insects

55
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,639
but something here just to consider

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,439
having maybe multiple colors

57
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,560
up for your able to go through and

58
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,078
screen the area

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,759
for thrips to identify them but

60
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,039
hopefully before you see damage to the

61
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,239
plants

62
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,680
so if you do see the image of the plants

63
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,039
how do you go about managing them well

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
neem oil

65
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,280
can be used but watch for potential

66
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,960
phytotoxicity to the plants as well as

67
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,479
final taste and smell impacts

68
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,478
especially applied later in the

69
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
flowering cycle pythons is an

70
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,879
insecticide

71
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,800
be sure to check your current local

72
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,199
regulations and also

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,040
watch applying it late in the season

74
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,000
insecticidal soap or is a general insect

75
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,000
control product

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,840
and there's also natural predators which

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,919
are best used when plants are in flower

78
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,159
to avoid potential negative impacts

79
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,119
to the final plant product getting those

80
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,439
established

81
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,280
before the thrips do gives you a leg up

82
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,878
and ensures that the thrips numbers will

83
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,039
be kept to a minimum

84
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,239
and hopefully also any threat of plant

85
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,919
damage also

86
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,920
will be kept to a minimum
