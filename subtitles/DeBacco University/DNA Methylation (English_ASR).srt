1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,579
looking at DNA methylation here looking

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,230
at the attachment of a methyl group

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,719
which is a ch3 component to a base pair

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,940
of DNA you can see it takes on many

5
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,160
different shapes here but methylation is

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:21,149
referring to the attachment of this

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,660
methyl group as we call methylated so a

8
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,489
methylated DNA molecule DNA methylation

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,980
is important for regulating gene

10
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:31,409
expression since its main purpose here

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,750
there's no change in the sequence which

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,189
is an important aspect to keep in mind

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,100
here that we're not changing the

14
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,468
sequence but we're still having a way of

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,558
regulating gene expression canopies

16
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,689
prevent genes from being expressed so

17
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,789
looking at these methyl groups being

18
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,890
attached here and indicated by these

19
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,230
kind of glowing areas on the DNA

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,820
molecule so during a gametogenesis

21
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,819
certain genes are methylated in tagged

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,109
as either maternal or paternal so how

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,140
does everybody know which one comes from

24
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,810
mom conclusion dad it can in some way

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,420
relate to the amount of methylation that

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,460
occurs developing I'm gonna read these

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,439
tags and express one version over the

28
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,209
other so genes that can be expressed

29
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,399
here's our promoter region in the kinam

30
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:19,679
gene can be expressed here's our methyl

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,380
groups methyl groups can cause students

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,600
to be inactivated in this case there's

33
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,339
nothing wrong here there's no mutations

34
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,048
that occurred but they're inactivated

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,030
because of the methyl groups attached

36
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,280
here kind of messing up that promoter

37
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,118
region not allowing those genes to be

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,900
made so methylation typically found out

39
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:41,819
it's called CPG Islands C in G should be

40
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,310
familiar with those are cytosine and

41
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,618
guanine so these citizen guanine which

42
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,450
areas are located upstream of the

43
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:51,060
promoter region if our promoter region

44
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,540
these are CPG Islands EB tree Islands

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,420
the P indicates it's a phosphodiester

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,390
bond so in humans methylation is the

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,250
result of DNA methyl transferase so

48
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,049
against an enzyme attaching these methyl

49
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,609
groups that's responsible for the

50
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,159
initial pattern during early development

51
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:11,098
and for copying the pattern during DNA

52
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,870
replication so not only does this occur

53
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:16,119
initially it can also be replicated

54
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,730
when DNA goes through that process and

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,939
our methyl groups typically represented

56
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,979
by these dark circles are unethical

57
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:27,699
aided groups by these open circles or

58
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:29,768
these white kind of circles here so this

59
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:32,378
phosphodiester bond not to get to too

60
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:36,400
much detail but what this is it's

61
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:39,280
between the nucleotides here and it's

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,459
which presents thymine and two molecules

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,348
of adenine so here's our thymine and

64
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:46,420
here's our two molecules aadmi this

65
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:49,719
phosphodiester bond is this what we're

66
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:52,750
looking at right here po4 the negative 3

67
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:55,359
in this case you can see right here are

68
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,930
thiamine and two molecules of adenine is

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,599
our phosphodiester bond it's occurring

70
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,579
now clone mice with different DNA and

71
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,500
methylation so genetically identical

72
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:08,099
individuals can look or behave very

73
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,120
differently based on the methylation

74
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:12,578
remember it's affecting the gene

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,780
expression not the sequence here we have

76
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:15,069
our two mice it looks slightly different

77
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,269
but if you look at the tails there's

78
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:18,759
definitely a difference in the tails

79
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:20,709
it's a nice normal tail here and this

80
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,530
one looks like it got run over or

81
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,329
something but this is because of the

82
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,509
methyl groups located in the tail region

83
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:32,290
of this mouse are altering the gene

84
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:34,959
expression so DNA methylation and probe

85
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:36,969
design so after a bisulfite treatment -

86
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,400
just a scientific treatment here we're

87
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:41,680
trying to determine what was methylated

88
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,719
or what was not the methyl group will

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,150
predict the cytosine otherwise would be

90
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,739
converted to year or so so this methyl

91
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,409
group when we have this bisulfite

92
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,689
treatment what's happening with cytosine

93
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:53,620
it would be converted to your cell under

94
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:55,449
normal conditions

95
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,849
that methyl group we know it's been as a

96
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:59,709
block it's like preventing that

97
00:03:57,848 --> 00:04:02,199
bisulfite treatment from changing that

98
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:04,560
as a result cytosine is conserved after

99
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,789
the treatment they do would add a probe

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,079
and you would see if it would bind and

101
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:12,879
like in the case of the methylated probe

102
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,239
that G is gonna find that that C

103
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,159
indicating Oh lights gonna be given off

104
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,319
in the case if it was unmethylated and

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,820
if this unmethylated probe was added you

106
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,500
see this has nothing to bind to this a

107
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:26,079
is nothing to find that C just going to

108
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,459
be floating around this case it binds in

109
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,680
the original string

110
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:31,810
was unmethylated so this methylation

111
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,300
probe design as a way to determine

112
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,250
through a bisulfite treatment whether or

113
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,689
not these methyl groups were present

114
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,639
again if it was present it's gonna

115
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:42,819
prevent that cytosine from being changed

116
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,860
to a year so that's just the result of a

117
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:46,330
typical bisulfite treatment that methyl

118
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,129
group will block that and prevent death

119
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:50,050
from occurring and use a probe here to

120
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:53,159
determine and indicate whether that was

121
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,180
present or not so they called a cobra

122
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,849
combined by sulphide restriction

123
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,160
analysis adult stands for typically used

124
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:03,788
in microbiology labs it's a test to

125
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,939
determine DNA methylation levels short

126
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:07,779
general explanation into fall in terms

127
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,728
PCR which we'll learn about in another

128
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:12,038
video it's a quick way to multiply DNA

129
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:14,500
sequence and restriction enzymes cut DNA

130
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:18,478
at very specific locations so when we

131
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,069
have our groups here the little ends the

132
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,050
bisulfite treatment occurs the C's

133
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:24,939
stacy's because the methyl groups blocks

134
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,860
that and we use our restriction enzyme

135
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:31,180
digestion and breaks in this case the

136
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,669
DNA sequence and here it's unprotected

137
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,009
those methyl groups are not present

138
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:38,680
during the bisulfite treatment those

139
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:41,139
seeds are converted to hues which then

140
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,908
are transferred to T's and DNA and then

141
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,370
we have a restriction enzyme that will

142
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:47,168
not recognize the particular sequence so

143
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,810
this Cobra may have heard this term

144
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:51,158
Kerberos combined all side-by sulfide

145
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,139
restriction analysis it's how we

146
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:57,728
determine the DNA methylation levels and

147
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,189
what this is used for comparing normal

148
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:02,769
cells to cancer cells and notice the

149
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:07,149
cancer cells have elevated these levels

150
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:09,120
of methylation so doesn't that if it's

151
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,899
methylated it's cancer it's not the case

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,870
methylation levels are typically

153
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:15,370
increased in cancer cells here and

154
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,408
that's evident could see our cancer

155
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,590
cells a lot more peaks of methylation

156
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:23,319
levels than our normal cells here so

157
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:26,619
just one way methylation can help change

158
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:30,598
or regulate gene expression typically

159
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,598
located upstream of a motor vision
