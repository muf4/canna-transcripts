1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
so on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:08,399
going to just go a brief

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,399
overview here of regarding cannabis

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,440
[Music]

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,879
education so education is important in

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,480
any walk of life like here we're going

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,439
to look a little bit more at

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,880
the importance of cannabis education and

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,480
when looking at campus education well

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,358
i'd like to say that you're in the right

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,439
place

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,640
the goal of this channel is to provide a

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,880
quality education

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,200
on all the topics covered regarding

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,079
canvas this can be difficult to come by

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,719
to get that kind of

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,160
information that is scientifically based

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,520
and by connecting to established

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,599
scientific information

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,879
this can help propel the expanse of

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
canvas education

22
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,640
forward and here at debaca university

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,359
hopefully you've seen some other videos

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,679
on that

25
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,840
try to connect a lot to the scientific

26
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,479
research while maybe somewhat limited

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,520
to again drive some more conversation

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,959
and to hopefully

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,960
keep propelling the education forward

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,040
now we want to avoid opinions now

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,599
opinions can be great initially

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,520
but for real basis of information

33
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,640
sometimes opinions as well as anecdotal

34
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,879
information can be

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,118
hard to separate from scientific based

36
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:18,079
information so be sure to trace

37
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,640
a source of the information presented

38
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,158
the goal

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,079
is really to base any sort of

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,880
conclusions or information you're

41
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,359
looking at

42
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,399
in scientific research this can be

43
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,400
difficult to find

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,920
and it can also be difficult to

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
initially read and that's why part of

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,640
the goal of this channel

47
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
is to kind of break it down and give you

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,519
kind of the adrenal summary if you have

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,478
more interest you can go into more

50
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,399
detail

51
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,679
now keep in mind opinions any little

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,359
information

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
opinions are kind of great at the very

54
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,399
first level here

55
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,239
but we want to work our way up to kind

56
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,320
of the more advanced

57
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,920
levels we're looking at research end of

58
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,359
things so it's a good starting point but

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,719
keep in mind it is only a starting point

60
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,759
so how could you go about kind of

61
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,798
starting your own scientific

62
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,879
investigation

63
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
well google scholar is a very powerful

64
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,039
search engine and tool to use

65
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,960
it's uh it's quickly uh it's quick to be

66
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,280
able to use it's very user friendly can

67
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,118
find

68
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
articles and topics that are

69
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:09,598
scientifically based so it's a good kind

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
of

71
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,919
area to start just search it type in

72
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,680
whatever you're interested in this

73
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,159
applies to cannabis as well as any other

74
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,719
topic

75
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,318
as well google scholar is a great way to

76
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,159
kind of be able to efficiently

77
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,679
search a lot of scientific articles

78
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,318
quickly

79
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,000
so when you find one scientific article

80
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,719
that you like well as i say one good

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
article

82
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,239
can lead to many more when you're

83
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,759
finding scientific articles the goal is

84
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
to find out one article you like on a

85
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,639
topic

86
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,199
well structured be sure to look at the

87
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,199
sources for potentially other related

88
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,238
articles as well look at their reference

89
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,479
list this can lead to an expansive list

90
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,519
but can help provide a well-rounded

91
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,959
education

92
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,319
also when you're reading the scientific

93
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,519
article there might be a little number

94
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,359
or last name

95
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,200
you can then match that up to the

96
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,400
reference list and then go research that

97
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,158
original article

98
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
it's a great way to kind of get more

99
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,039
into the details whatever topic

100
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,799
or subject area you're looking at

101
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,719
learning about

102
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,159
now scientific articles are provided so

103
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,400
when scientific

104
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,318

now here at debacle university we're not

123
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,200
just a standalone area we are

124
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
utilized these videos are utilized at

i'm sure there are many others if you're

131
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,158
watching us from another university or

132
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
another professors link these videos be

133

biology and forensic science

139
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,039
it's always great to see where students

140
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,638
are from so if you want to comment by
