1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
okay here we're gonna go a little detail

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,269
about controlling co2 levels what we see

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,950
in the image here it is an actual

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:10,558
controller brainbox

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,019
we see a remote sensor here you see a

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:16,799
power cord all these can work in unison

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,980
to help regulate co2 levels in a grow

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,140
facility here so what are the co2 levels

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,060
while monitoring co2 levels is critical

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,250
to maintain an efficient grow operation

11
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:28,140
no matter the size so is we're talking

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,460
it could be a small grow tent it could

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,618
be a large room could be even a

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,480
warehouse monitoring the co2 levels are

15
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,130
important however it's important to

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,869
remember it's one thing to know the co2

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,980
levels but it's another thing to do

18
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,079
something about it

19
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,729
so just monitoring didn't know the co2

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,590
levels is one step in the right

21
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,628
direction but being able to correct

22
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,539
those or maintain those at a certain

23
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:51,058
level would be the next step or logical

24
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,710
progression of growers should take so

25
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,259
there's co2 controllers we see the one

26
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,420
pictured here quality co2 controllers

27
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,189
are directly connected to a delivery

28
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,739
system which can offers the greatest

29
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:04,920
level of control over the co2 levels in

30
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,840
a gross space so they're monitoring and

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,000
they're adding or taking on the system

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,469
when they need to when the co2 levels

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,510
are getting too low and turn off when

34
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:15,030
it's getting too high these controllers

35
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,380
are the best for maintaining levels of

36
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,349
carbon oxide within a certain or

37
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:21,750
predetermined range now when you want to

38
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:24,149
add co2 well so you can benefit the

39
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,670
plant through all stages of growth so

40
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,340
even pretty much it from just beyond

41
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,129
seedling phase all the way to the end it

42
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,659
is beneficial to add co2 however it

43
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,069
should only be added during daylight

44
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,590
hours because this is when the light

45
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:39,658
reaction of photosynthesis is active and

46
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,540
this is the plant when it's consuming

47
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,149
carbon dioxide so as far as far as

48
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,368
stages of plants go the entire stage of

49
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,430
growth as far as when specifically on a

50
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:52,049
day to day basis when the light when the

51
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,720
Sun lights out or when the lights are on

52
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,600
is the best time to be dosing carbon

53
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,849
dioxide now when we're looking at dosing

54
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,629
there can be timers or controllers as

55
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:05,968
options timers are by far less expensive

56
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,978
and they release carbon dioxide at a

57
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:08,969
consistent predetermined intervals and

58
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:10,530
durations

59
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,719
this requires calculations and

60
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,949
estimations of plant consumption and a

61
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,109
photocell is advised

62
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:18,060
only daytime dosing is I'll provide it

63
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,920
we can see that here on this timer here

64
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,680
there's a photocell meaning this will

65
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,229
only activate this repeat cycle timer

66
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,550
when this is getting exposed to light so

67
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,409
that's a good option to have if you're

68
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,910
going with the timer system however they

69
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,459
do tend to lead to kind of estimation

70
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:35,068
and they can lead to that loss or

71
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,050
wasting of co2 but a little bit better

72
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,379
is controllers they've actually given

73
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,489
current conditions this allows from

74
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:43,348
adjustments to be made to maximize

75
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,810
efficiency and help ensure co2 levels

76
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:47,340
are being maintained as a result these

77
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,590
controllers are preferred over those

78
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,579
timers you can see the one pictured here

79
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:57,120
can work with generators can work with

80
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:59,430
tank systems has a lot of options that

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,730
can be utilized there the controllers

82
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,939
are much preferred over timers now

83
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:08,488
controllers have you select a max and

84
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,650
minimum and maintain within this range

85
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,049
this is improvement over timers but it

86
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,959
can still lead to wasted co2 by

87
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:18,389
overshooting the maximum and over the

88
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,530
course of changing conditions so what

89
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:21,900
you want to look for in a controller

90
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,609
what the best controllers are are ones

91
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,129
that catch something called fuzzy logic

92
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:27,359
and it's kind of listed right here

93
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:29,729
looking for controllers are definitely

94
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:31,799
an advantage over timers and the

95
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:34,169
preferred controllers are ones that have

96
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:38,040
this called fuzzy logic mode they help

97
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:40,919
maintain this kind of efficient levels

98
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,689
of co2 without over or under dosing the

99
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,250
grow facility now have a separate video

100
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,030
on that if you care to learn more about

101
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,030
the fuzzy logic
