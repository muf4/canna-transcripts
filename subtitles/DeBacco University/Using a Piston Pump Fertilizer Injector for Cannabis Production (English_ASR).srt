1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
if you're interested in using a piston

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:16,000
pump to fertilize your plants

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:17,919
this debaco university video is for you

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,439
right let's get into using a piston pump

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,240
fertilizer injector for cannabis

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,679
production

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,759
now as we can see here in this

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,198
commercial operation a lot of commercial

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
operations use more than just one they

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,720
use a lot of them

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,320
these are dosatrons some people just

12
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,320
refer them as dosatrons but it is kind

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,759
of a name brand there are some other

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,679
options of chemi injector and

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,878
many many others but dosatron is kind of

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,159
the name brand

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:41,599
you can see here each one hooked up to a

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,199
different fertilizer tank allowing

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,359
different valves to be controlled

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,640
really allowing for an efficient method

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,039
of fertilization

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
to the plants and this is why this is so

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,640
popular

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,920
used in cannabis production facilities

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,439
so first off we're looking

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,600
here we're looking at the flow inside

27
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,000
the pump and reciprocating pumps are

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,198
pumps

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,039
in which a piston or diaphragm displaces

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:03,920
a given amount of chemical with each

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,599
stroke

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
the change in internal volume of the

33
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,879
pump creates high pressure

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
which forces chemicals into the

35
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,239
discharge pipe so what we're kind of

36
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,679
seeing here is we have our concentrated

37
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,039
solution down here at the bottom

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,118
it's being brought up through a suction

39
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,240
force it's being mixed with the water

40
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,159
through a piston

41
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,759
and then the blended solution is going

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
out to the plants

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,280
these make a very distinctive clicking

44
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,519
sound as that pump comes up and down

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,879
up and down up and down and it will

46
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,319
change with the rate of the flow if you

47
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,199
can increase the flow rate the piston go

48
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,798
up faster

49
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,719
if you decrease the rate of flow the

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,320
piston will go up slower

51
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,400
and what that is doing is that's

52
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,199
allowing for a very consistent

53
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,478
amount of fertilizer to be added to this

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
mixing area here

55
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,640
now it's important you have a pressure

56
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,399
regulator and also have a filter

57
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,920
so you're not having any clogging issues

58
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,719
as well as a check valve to run any

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,759
backflow

60
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,798
but these are very precise methods of

61
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,840
injecting fertilizer to irrigation water

62
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,600
now the basic operation of the piston

63
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
pump is similar to that

64
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,679
of the cylinder in an automobile engine

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,599
kind of the compression stroke an

66
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,200
increase in decrease to power stroke

67
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,120
the initial stroke the chemical enters

68
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,359
the cylinder through the

69
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,200
suction check valve you see down here

70
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,879
and a compression stroke the chemical is

71
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,199
forced into the discharge line

72
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,399
be located over here through the

73
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,119
discharge check valve

74
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
and this is water flow driven which is

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,878
great because it offers

76
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,959
consistent dilution rates and no needed

77
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,759
add for any electricity

78
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,319
or any other inputs simply the flow of

79
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,919
water

80
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,359
will allow this pump to work just fine

81
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,039
so it's also offers

82
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
self-correction so most piston pumps are

83
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,840
driven by the flowing water through the

84
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,359
injector that drives the motion of the

85
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
pump as i mentioned earlier

86
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,319
the movement of the piston will vary

87
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,319
with the speed of the water flow which

88
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,560
is great because it self regulates

89
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,679
so this self corrects and ensures very

90
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,878
consistent

91
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,239
dilution rates and very consistent rates

92
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,479
given to the plants

93
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,080
the larger piston is driven by the

94
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,959
pressure of the irrigation system the

95
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,719
smaller

96
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,039
injects the chemical into the irrigation

97
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,318
line and all this simply works with

98
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,840
water pressure

99
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,679
however this is one of the downfalls as

100
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,878
there are some moving parts that can

101
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,239
wear over time

102
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:16,158
particularly with excessive use

103
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,680
now there's also an example here of a

104
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,039
grower set up and it shows the

105
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,480
fertilizer

106
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,400
injector here along with a pre-filter

107
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,598
so you can have your kind of pre-filter

108
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,080
going through and

109
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,359
ensuring that you're filtering out any

110
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
contaminants you're not going to wear

111
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,239
this out

112
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,000
as quickly you have a pressure valve

113
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,280
located before and after again help

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
regulate and make sure there's no

115
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
pressure loss

116
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,599
fertilizer concentration tank located

117
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,840
right down here

118
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,798
a water bypass if you didn't want not

119
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,239
want to add any

120
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
fertilizer injector had a problem wanted

121
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,799
to remove on the system

122
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,318
a little bypass valve there also hooked

123
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,719
up to here a timer

124
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,158
and a post injection filter as well to

125
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,199
prevent anything that may have get

126
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,598
pulled up in the line

127
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,798
before it enters your irrigation system

128
00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:59,679
particularly important with drip

129
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,760
irrigation

130
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
but this kind of shows you a setup and

131
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,039
how they can be used in a small

132
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,959
hole in their operation as well as a

133
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,039
large commercial operation

134
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,239
it offers a lot of good consistency

135
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,438
which is part of the reason

136
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,438
why they're so popular
