1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
here we're looking at symbiosis and this

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,318
is a prime example of the title image

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,939
right here we have the Rhino as a

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,879
symbiotic relationship with the

5
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,379
red-billed ops tech are here we can see

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,660
that right here so the somatic

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,640
relationship between these two different

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,730
species so it's going to a little bit

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,589
more what this actually means so as we

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,890
look at this well Samantha fine at first

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:28,140
it's the condition in which two or more

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,939
kinds of organisms live together in

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,489
close associations with one another

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,719
there's major times I try to this kind

15
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,659
of image gives you a good tennis

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,910
comparison between the two we have a

17
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,709
communalism where one species benefits

18
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,179
and the other neither benefits nor is

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,829
harmed can have that here we have one

20
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,659
it's benefitting and when it's not

21
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,489
harmed but really doesn't benefit either

22
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:50,218
from the relationship then with

23
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:52,078
parasitism we're one species benefits

24
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,759
while the other is harmed so here we

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,230
have the species benefiting and the

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,019
other one is actually harmed in this

27
00:00:55,229 --> 00:01:00,779
case in mutualism both participating

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,930
species have a benefit so that's the

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,540
third type of symbiosis and this can

30
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,670
occur in aquatic environments as well as

31
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,180
terrestrial ones so I want to be mindful

32
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,960
that this occurring not just on land

33
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,420
let's look more specifically at

34
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,579
mutualism here it's in that relationship

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,680
in which both species of benefits so

36
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,840
here's an example with ants we have

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,340
eight heads well if it's provide the

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,859
ants with food in the form of

39
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,329
continuously excreted honeydew that's

40
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,159
what I do from the leaves or piercing

41
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,859
the leaf parts and sugars coming out and

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,990
it's at the ants feeding off the ants

43
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,560
transport the aphids and protect them

44
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:38,399
from predators

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,219
so Athens typically are fed on by lady

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,130
beetles and as a result the ant offers

47
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,349
protection for the aphids in exchange

48
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,239
for the Clady that it will provide from

49
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:51,089
the plant this is a mutual benefit the

50
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,280
agent as an event being moved around and

51
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:58,049
protected and gets the benefit of the

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,030
honeydew ants and our kids so our kids

53
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,030
provide the ants with food in the form

54
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,250
of belton bodies hands provide these

55
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,409
archaeans with organic nutrients and

56
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,929
predict them from herbivores and shading

57
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,890
from other plants so again mutualistic

58
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,750
both species are benefiting in this case

59
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,909
parasitism so it's a little different

60
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,819
it's a symbiotic relationship and that

61
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:24,189
is the form of predation so the predator

62
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:26,379
or parasite is much smaller than the

63
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:27,159
prey and the prey does not necessarily

64
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,840
die

65
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,210
so in parasitism we have the example of

66
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,849
the mosquito and the human here we have

67
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:37,000
one benefiting and one has a negative

68
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:40,180
effect here so we have the mosquito in

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,689
the human we have the sea lamprey in the

70
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:47,200
fish we have the lion in the wildebeest

71
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:49,900
here so parasitism well external

72
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,449
parasites is an example ectoparasites

73
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,370
feed on the exterior surface of an

74
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:58,599
organism so an example of this is the

75
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,759
ticks shooting at us

76
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,400
they are ectoparasites because they're

77
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,379
feeding on the surface of us there's two

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,260
toys or insects or wasps that lay eggs

79
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:10,629
on a living host so a parasitic wasp

80
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:12,370
will lay eggs inside of an insect and

81
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:15,129
then they'll grow multiply and divide

82
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,550
within an insect a prime example is here

83
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:20,349
horn worms that feed on tomato plants

84
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,769
could be infected with a parasitic wasp

85
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:25,419
we see here on the offspring here and

86
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,459
it's basically eating the horn room from

87
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:29,109
the inside out include a little bit of a

88
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,120
video here if you want to check that out

89
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,519
remember the link to the slides is in

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,289
the description we have here with this

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,969
horns here and fed from the inside out

92
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:38,859
that will stop its feeding so I only

93
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:40,840
saved the tomato plant but it also

94
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,080
caused more parasitic wasps to be in the

95
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,759
local area we have something called endo

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,830
parasites which lived within the bodies

97
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,379
and domain inside within the bodies of

98
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,019
vertebrates and invertebrates marked by

99
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:55,180
much more extensive specialization than

100
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,340
external parasites so external pairs

101
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,110
have to kind of like grazers here in the

102
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,849
parasites Nina's very specific match

103
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,430
they might be in a specific area of the

104
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,469
body would be turning certain organs so

105
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,480
they're much more specialized but

106
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:11,169
endoparasites referring to parasites and

107
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:13,090
the inside of a organism brood parasites

108
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:16,329
are birds they lay eggs in the nest of

109
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,280
other species so bird species reduce the

110
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:21,159
reproductive success of the foster

111
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,839
parent host so his example here we have

112
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,520
all these eggs and one looks like it

113
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,159
doesn't belong well this is actually a

114
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:29,919
cow bird it's a brood parasite meaning

115
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,860
female cowbird lays its eggs in the nest

116
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,420
of in this case the eastern TV season TV

117
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,460
can I take care of all the young all the

118
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,720
eggs I just like they were their own but

119
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,149
there's gonna be this one that is

120
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,880
actually a cow bird it'll be taken care

121
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:44,469
of so this is an example of a parasite

122
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,149
because this Eastern Phoebe I said do

123
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,310
that much more work to feed another

124
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:52,179
individual even though it's not the same

125
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,769
species communalism somatic relationship

126
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,079
that benefits one species in either

127
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:58,060
harm's nor benefits the other our

128
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,909
example here is the clownfish in see

129
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,470
enemies contain protection by remaining

130
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,170
among me and then these tentacles here

131
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,510
can be able to hide and they're also

132
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,819
immune to these stinging this that they

133
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:12,430
may produce and they also glean scraps

134
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:15,129
off from the anemones food so again not

135
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,259
really harming or benefiting either or

136
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:22,089
but these are typically seen in close

137
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:24,159
proximity to one another so another

138
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,899
example of that is a cattle egrets in

139
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,580
African cape buffalo

140
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:29,829
so egrets eat the insects off the

141
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:30,669
Buffalo but there's no clear distinction

142
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,310
between comunism

143
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,680
in mutualism difficult to to rent the

144
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:39,819
second printer benefits at all so while

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,220
the Egret here is eating the insects

146
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:45,730
they haven't ate Buffalo not really a

147
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,760
direct kind of benefit nor a direct kind

148
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,439
of harm to that one there so this kind

149
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,269
of relationship may even be parasitic in

150
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,740
some cases but this is just one example

151
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,569
of communalism we're having the

152
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,519
symbiotic relationship we often see the

153
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,040
Buffalo you'll see the birds the birds

154
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,859
are benefiting by eating the insects and

155
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,450
the Buffalo is really neither harmed

156
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,040
normative from this relationship same

157
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,629
thing here with our sea enemies and

158
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,510
remember we can occur in aquatic and

159
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,850
terrestrial ecosystems and there's just

160
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:15,120
some examples of symbiosis that does

161
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,120
occur
