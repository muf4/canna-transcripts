00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,879
on this debaco university video i'll go

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,650
over air circulation for indoor cannabis

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,820

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,519
if we're growing cannabis indoors we

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,480
know the importance of air circulation

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,358
so let's learn about some of the details

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,600
so first off

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,199
it is important because indoor growing

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,118
environments are protected areas that

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,118
limit natural airflow

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,480
while some pruning methods can help open

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,719
up a plant structures

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,880
there still is no substitute for moving

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
air within a grow space

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,719
fans are highly recommended to help aid

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,000
this process and air circulation can

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,239
help strengthen plants

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,600
and also reduce pest and disease

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,399
pressure

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
large in small large spaces need air

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,120
movement so just because you're growing

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,280
in one area versus another don't think

24
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,878
it's any more or less important

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,558
even if you're growing in just one plant

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,159
air movement is still important

27
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,000
in a small grow tent this can be as

28
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,558
simple as a little six inch fan as we

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
kind of see

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,320
right here and in larger grow spaces

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
this can mean

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,560
large oscillating fans and multiples of

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,879
them and putting different directions

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,719
help

35
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,319
move air through so again whether it's a

36
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,118
small space large space

37
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,279
one plant many plants air movement still

38
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,280
important and needed

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,118
so how long should the fan be on people

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,000
wonder if i should have put a timer on

41
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,079
my fan

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,680
and really unlike lights fans should be

43
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,438
running 24 hours

44
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,880
a day seven days a week they should

45
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,039
always be moving air

46
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,158
even when plants are resting in the dark

47
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,479
or night cycle

48
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,920
moving air is still important moving air

49
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,519
can help reduce the humidity

50
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,759
and moisture accumulation on the plant

51
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,438
surface to help mitigate potential

52
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,239
disease pressure this is why it's

53
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,599
important

54
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,359
and here we see in this facility we see

55
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,640
flans on the wall we see fans on the

56
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,920
floor again

57
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,759
pointing in different directions these

58
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,960
are oscillating keeping that air

59
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,239
moving all the time horizontal air flow

60
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,679
is something else we want to consider

61
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,280
and oscillating fans maximize the

62
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
airflow in the growing area

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
as a general rule you want to select a

64
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,399
fan with a cfm

65
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,799
which stands for cubic feet per minute

66
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
equal to or greater than the size of

67
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,600
your growing space

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,360
so for a growing space of a thousand

69
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,560
cubic feet you should have about a

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
thousand cfm

71
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,318
fan just to again give you an idea of

72
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,359
the approximate size

73
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,719
of to match your growing facility we

74
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,200
also want to be considering the

75
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,159
vertical kind of airflow this will mix

76
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,079
the air to avoid

77
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,280
temperature stratification remember hot

78
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,719
air wants to rise

79
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,878
cold air wants to sink we want to make

80
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,519
sure we're kind of mixing that

81
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,359
well important too much of a good thing

82
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,800
can have a negative impact especially if

83
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,000
the grow space is being enriched with

84
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,599
carbon dioxide

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
so i make that note in the sense that we

86
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,719
don't want to aggressively

87
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
mix our air vertically because we might

88
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,878
be exhausting out more carbon dioxide

89
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
but it is good also to think about in

90
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:50,399
that vertical sense to keep the air

91
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,640
moving lastly kind of a way to

92
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
ensure that you're able to adjust the

93
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,839
conditions to best match

94
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,280
the number of plants or size of plants

95
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,519
that you have

96
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
having a fan that can be linked up to a

97
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,680
fan speed control

98
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,519
is a good option to have having control

99
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,040
over fan speed can help ensure that the

100
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,000
correct amount of air movement can be

101
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,158
achieved

102
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,919
and this allows adjustments to be made

103
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,679
over the growing cycle

104
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,679
number of plants that might be in moved

105
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
in or moved out so it's just good to

106
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,840
have this as an option

107
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,519
as you're looking at maximizing air

108
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,519
circulation around your plants

109
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,719
to create a healthy and supportive

110
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,719
growing environment
