1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,800
you ever wonder what conditions you

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,318
should keep your mother or stock

3
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,679
cannabis plants in

4
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,160
well here we're going to go over the

5
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,839
details on how to maximize

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,830
uh the conditions for your mother or

7
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,919
stock plant here on debaco

8
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,929

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,800

10
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,320
[Music]

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,679
all right let's get into the ideal

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,039
conditions for your mother or stock

13
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,358
cannabis plant

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,720
so first off the goals keep the material

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
healthy and this is paramount

16
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,320
you're not necessarily looking for yield

17
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,839
instead the goal is to produce plant

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
biomass in a form

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,079
of active shoot tips if you're looking

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,920
at cloning that mother or stock plant

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,160
and keeping them healthy is very

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,920
important a growing plant is good but

23
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,839
the real goal of a stock plant is to be

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,359
a source of more plant material

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,719
so as a result we do some things

26
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,600
slightly different than we would in the

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,759
vegetative

28
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,039
growing phase now while the vegetative

29
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,159
environment in general is a good

30
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,280
representation

31
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,718
of what you should have for a stock or

32
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,399
mother plant i'm going to make some

33
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,759
slight tweaks to those general

34
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,000
recommendations

35
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,158
so what do those slight adjustments look

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,519
like well i've provided them here in an

37
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,880
organized list

38
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,799
first off we want approximately an

39
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,158
18-hour photo period want to make sure

40
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,680
we're keeping that plant in the

41
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,680
vegetative state

42
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,759
the temperature for day night should be

43
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,640
maintained was around that 70 or 20

44
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,478
degrees celsius

45
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,000
and keeping that relatively warm

46
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,319
conditions but not excessively

47
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,478
hot conditions relative humidity around

48
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,559
that 63 percent is advised

49
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,239
to help keep the chance for disease down

50
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
and help reduce water stress on the

51
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,640
plant

52
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,240
now if you're growing that mother stock

53
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,040
plant it's carbon accident

54
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,759
enrichment can be at a concentration

55
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
level of about 650 parts per million

56
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,200
a lot of growers will look at that and

57
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,759
say well why even add carbon dioxide at

58
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,399
all

59
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,599
you don't necessarily have to or why

60
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,359
don't you bump that up to like a

61
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,000
thousand or eleven hundred parts per

62
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,359
million

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
well keep in mind we're looking at

64
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,078
growing the plant but we're not looking

65
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,079
at necessarily

66
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,438
speed growing the plant per say you

67
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,438
could always increase that to help

68
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,599
increase you know biomass and yield a

69
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,959
little bit but remember our goal here

70
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,959
is really to produce more actively

71
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,478
growing shoot tips to produce more

72
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,438
asexual

73
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,118
vegetative propagation points mother

74
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,799
plants typically grown in five to ten

75
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,159
plus gallon containers i've seen some in

76
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,239
very large containers

77
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,079
and that depends on the grower's area or

78
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,878
the age that they want to keep that

79
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,800
plant

80
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,878
stock plants of about 10 months old

81
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,719
should have between 20 and 25 nodes on

82
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,479
their main stem just to give you kind of

83
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,680
a general kind of target there

84
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,598
if you have a 10 month old plant

85
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,640
approximately how big it should be if

86
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,719
not you might want to look at your

87
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,919
conditions to see if they match these

88
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,680
and see if you want to make any

89
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,280
adjustments to those conditions to keep

90
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,120
the mother and stock plant in

91
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,800
so not only do you have a healthy plant

92
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,560
a plant that will produce many

93
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,120
clones but this can help improve the

94
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
efficiency of your operation overall
