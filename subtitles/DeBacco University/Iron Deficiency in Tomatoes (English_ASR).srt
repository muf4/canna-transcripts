1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,520
okay when most growers see yelling to

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
their leaves

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,960
their tomatoes they often think it's a

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,040
nitrogen deficiency

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,800
and while that may be the case we have

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,399
to look closely at those

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
yellowing leaves in this case these

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
yellowing leaves are

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,519
very characteristic of an iron

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,519
deficiency

11
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,679
and we're going to look at this how in

12
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,079
tomato plants

13
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,759
so iron the plant importance and again

14
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:26,239
that yellowing we want to be very

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,560
specific

16
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,278
what we're looking at in that in the

17
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,358
plant

18
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,359
first off iron is an immobile a

19
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
secondary nutrient

20
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,759
it's involved with many enzymes and some

21
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,920
pigments as well within the plant

22
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,479
but we could see that that yellowing has

23
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,760
this characteristic

24
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:48,878
green kind of veins with yellowing of

25
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,479
in between those veins now

26
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,079
a lot of people think they see yelling

27
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,000
they think of nitrogen

28
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,320
and while the pla the iron does aid the

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,719
plant with nitrate and sulfate reduction

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
in energy production this is

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,558
characteristic of

32
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,760
in iron deficiency one thing that makes

33
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:07,280
it very characteristic

34
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,798
is the location of the yellowing

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
because iron is essential for the

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,200
formation of chlorophyll this is why we

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,080
see that loss of green color and in the

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
extreme cases here we see that yellowing

39
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,920
and so that chlorosis is what we would

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,239
call it it's particularly

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,519
evident in the newer leaves the younger

42
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,039
leaves the upper leaves

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,959
and that's what makes iron very

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
characteristic iron there's another

45
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,959
video on that and that will be

46
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,040
in different regions of the plant iron

47
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,000
is also more available in acidic

48
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,000
ph values so that's below seven so keep

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,200
in mind if the soil or media ph

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,239
is off that can affect iron availability

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,399
onto the plant now a trial was carried

52
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,239
out in tomatoes in a hydroponic

53
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,759
setup in a greenhouse for consistent

54
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,478
conditions

55
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,000
and allowed that plant to receive the

56
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,478
plethora of nutrients that

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,920
it needs minus the one being study in

58
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,200
this case it's the iron

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,280
so the control plant was filled with

60
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,280
balanced fertilizer

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,599
a complete kind of collection of

62
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,239
nutrients and the test plant received

63
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,079
everything

64
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:12,239
except in this case iron being studied

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
so this is a characteristic iron

66
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,680
deficiency

67
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,080
notice the overall lack of vigor that we

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
see in this plant overall

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,440
so this is one thing one is lack of

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,680
vigor

71
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,359
however if we look more closely at the

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,319
upper and newer leaves

73
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,760
they have poor green color they have a

74
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,759
yellow look to them

75
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,759
and that's simply because of the lack of

76
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,479
chlorophyll that's being able to form

77
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,239
in that newer growth and simply due to

78
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,159
the restriction this plant has on the

79
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,200
lack of iron that it has

80
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,199
in its growing solution the older

81
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,318
or lower leaves in this case remain

82
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,318
green color

83
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,039
but it's definitely that newer growth

84
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:54,000
we're seeing that yellow that chlorosis

85
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,919
at the most extreme here's the

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
comparison here's that same plant we saw

87
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,799
there minus the iron here's a control

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,800
plant

89
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,480
when it was fed a balanced fertilizer so

90
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,879
the control plant has even green color

91
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,158
overall very vigorous so vigorously kind

92
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,919
of fell over

93
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,079
it's a key comparison here is that new

94
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,719
growth is as consistent as the older

95
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,400
growth

96
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,919
here minus the iron when we compare the

97
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
lack of vigor number one

98
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,839
but we also have that newer growth being

99
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,840
very yellow in the older growth being

100
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,080
green in this case

101
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,120
now how do we correct an iron deficiency

102
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,680
which hopefully we don't

103
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
we never see but if we do see one

104
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,480
there's different forms of iron

105
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,959
obviously you have a liquid and here we

106
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,280
have kind of a soil applied one

107
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,719
chelated forms of iron are recommended

108
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,598
to help the plant use it very

109
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,120
efficiently

110
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,959
especially when there's a deficiency

111
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,360
symptoms we want to make sure that

112
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,000
plants getting iron fed to it

113
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,400
readily and it's readily available now

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,479
i've just

115
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,000
had some sample rates here may vary in

116
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,798
what product you do purchase dude look

117
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,120
at the

118
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,920
recommended rates but kind of a starting

119
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,239
rate iron

120
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,839
sulfate and that's kind of the one here

121
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,680
in the uh in the bag

122
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,799
typically soil test driven so it's not

123
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
something you're just going to normally

124
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
add

125
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,878
typically starting with about half a

126
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,560
tablespoon for two by two

127
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:09,039
area pros it has sulfur added as well

128
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,120
but the negative to that is that sulfur

129
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,479
can actually lower the ph so be mindful

130
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,280
if your ph is right where you want it

131
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,359
and you add that

132
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,879
you might be falling into an acidic

133
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,199
situation

134
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,879
chelated a liquid iron one oz per gallon

135
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,000
soil or foliar applications could be

136
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,680
applied

137
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,639
it's a liquid so it can be applied to

138
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,478
the leaves as an option

139
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,240
also sometimes contains other

140
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,199
micronutrients which can be an added

141
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,040
benefit

142
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,600
though the negative it does require

143
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,520
repeated applications to be effective

144
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,879
uh when you're using the liquid product

145
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,839
so if it's something you want to catch

146
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,000
very early

147
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,839
in those extreme cases those leaves may

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,279
never yellow up and that plant might be

149
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,119
currently stunted

150
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,478
so hopefully this helps you identify if

151
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
you see yellowing leaves if they're at

152
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,519
the top

153
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,519
you probably have an iron deficiency
