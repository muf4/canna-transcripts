1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
here we're gonna look at the

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,599
communication between neurons because

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,460
your body has so many neurons are all

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,279
interconnected it's very important that

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,570
they are able to communicate and relay

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,919
signals from one to the other now first

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,560
off we have to understand the basic

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,010
anatomy of a neuron now we see a prime

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:25,140
example of one pictured here you see

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,118
highly branched region leading to kind

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,339
of a central point into this kind of

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,308
central fiber here then another kind of

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:35,070
area that branches now the first part

14
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,599
here we call this the dendrites these

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,909
are fibers that receive messages from

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,859
other neurons they then will take that

17
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,808
signal will continue down we know where

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,869
the dendrites are located we see the

19
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:47,609
cell body which has the nucleus it's

20
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,709
important also to remember that these

21
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,719
message will only travel in one

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,179
direction starting with degenerates

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,090
going this to the cell body ultimately

24
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,738
leading down the axon but the accent is

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,870
is the fiber that sends a message to

26
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,538
other neurons you can see it also

27
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,609
branches here at the end but the signals

28
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,170
will only go one way they go in the

29
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,510
dendrites which is okay the area where

30
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,960
the cell body is down the axon and it

31
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,909
will be passed on to other neurons the

32
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,489
passing on that occurs between neurons

33
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,750
there's at the synapse now it's

34
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:20,699
important to remember that neurons don't

35
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,799
actually touch one another it's actually

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,868
a gap between them called a synapse let

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,250
me see that evident right here so while

38
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:28,109
it may look like they're touching in

39
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,719
these diagrams they're actually not

40
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:32,700
there's a synapse there now these

41
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,798
messages that are going traveling down

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,540
the axons are sent across the synapse

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,549
through special chemicals called

44
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,860
neurotransmitters and we see those

45
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,439
evident here there are the what's being

46
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:47,340
passed on through this area here this

47
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:49,559
physical space between our two neurons

48
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,409
keep in mind that the end here is our

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,019
axon and here is our dendrite of our

50
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,670
next neuron now the use of

51
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,048
neurotransmitters causes an electrical

52
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,899
current there's actually enough

53
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,360
electrical current generated in your

54
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,030
brain to power a flashlight they came

55
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,068
just how many of these neurons are being

56
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,179
actively fired and these synapses are

57
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:11,789
actually transmitting these

58
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,439
neurotransmitters my familiar with some

59
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,769
of our ions that are being transported

60
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,109
are we

61
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,540
scepters are very important that's

62
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,490
occurring in this region synaptic cleft

63
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,979
again in that physical space between the

64
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:26,159
axon terminal and the dendritic spine

65
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,359
here of the next neuron and

66
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,310
neurotransmitters are chemicals

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,860
responsible for signal transmission

68
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,560
between individual neurons most neurons

69
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,210
make one or more neurotransmitters which

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,479
are released at different stimulation

71
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,560
frequencies while 50 or more

72
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,629
neurotransmitters have been identified

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm only going to cover a couple here

74
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,500
and they're classified by their chemical

75
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,080
structure and also by their function

76
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,900
you'll notice here we see the same axon

77
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,460
in synaptic cleft and then the dendrite

78
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,960
of the next neuron

79
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,340
it's important to remember with their

80
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,080
neurotransmitters it's foreign port we

81
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,750
also have receptors here for those

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,110
neurotransmitters now just touching on a

83
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,280
couple of the neurotransmitters again

84
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,930
they're chemicals that carry nerve

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,969
impulses across the synapse

86
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,189
they bind the receptors in a

87
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:13,680
postsynaptic cell causing chemically

88
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:15,449
gated channels to open some you might be

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,650
initially familiar with are adrenaline

90
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:18,929
that's kind of your fight-or-flight

91
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,810
response and they're produced in

92
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,030
stressful situations dopamine is kind of

93
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,539
the pleasure neurotransmitter associated

94
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,830
with movement and motivation and

95
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,929
serotonin is the mood neurotransmitter

96
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,360
can be associated with well-being and

97
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,640
happiness it also in AIDS in the sleep

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
cycle in digestive system regulation

99
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,208
gives you a little bit of idea of how

100
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,609
they may look initially they may look

101
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,520
very similar but you can see there's

102
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,140
very distinctive differences within some

103
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,810
of the binding that occurs between these

104
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:52,019
so adrenaline dopamine and serotonin are

105
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,069
three three other major ones are G a B a

106
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,550
and that's the counting or

107
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:58,189
neurotransmitter comes the firing of

108
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,500
nerves in the central nervous system

109
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:05,039
helps improve focus low levels can cause

110
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,959
anxiety acetylcholine there's a learning

111
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,060
in our transmitter involved with thought

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,310
learning and memory something maybe you

113
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,629
want a little bit more of and lastly

114
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,420
just the one that I'm gonna cover here

115
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:18,209
kind of over 50 possible options is

116
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,819
endorphins know the euphoria transmitter

117
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,530
they're they're the ones that are

118
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,269
released during exercise and points of

119
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:26,159
excitement and they can help reduce pain

120
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,430
this is why I ever kind of been doing

121
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,380
something

122
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,790
and kind of in the heat of battle and

123
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:32,168
you have really seen endorphins and you

124
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,330
kind of cut yourself or injure yourself

125
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:36,759
you may not realize it or feel the full

126
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:38,459
effects of the pain until after after

127
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,329
the endorphin levels have been reduced

128
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:43,680
hopefully this gives you a general idea

129
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:43,680
of how neurons communicate
