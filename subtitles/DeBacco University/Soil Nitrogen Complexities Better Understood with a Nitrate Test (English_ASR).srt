1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
in this debaco university video hope to

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,878
try

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,718
to reduce some of the complications

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:17,589
when looking at nitrogen as a fertilizer

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:20,719
when trying to grow plants

6
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:23,039
[Music]

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,239
so nitrogen may just be one nutrient but

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,880
it can perform

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,759
a lot of different kind of transitions

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,839
it can as

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
can become very complex in the different

12
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,880
forms that it takes

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,320
the hope here is to try to reduce some

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,840
of those complexities

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,399
we're going to look at soil nitrogen

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
complexities to better understood with a

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,000
nitrate test

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,600
and at the end some fertilizer

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
recommendations will be provided at

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,320
least

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
in general to act as a general summary

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,119
here

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,719
so the impact of nitrogen on plants

24
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,519
nitrogen is an important nutrient to be

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,039
looking at

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,359
it's because it's part of all living

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,000
cells nitrogen promotes green leaf

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,159
growth

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,198
and lack of nitrogen commonly can limit

30
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,119
plant growth

31
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,119
plants uptake nitrogen in the form of

32
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,599
nitrate no3 or ammonium

33
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,319
nh4 with the nitrate form being

34
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,559
preferred

35
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,559
by many garden plants so it's not only

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,280
just the nutrient it's also the

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,879
molecule that comes in to help impact

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,879
and change how it might be open to

39
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,879
uptake by a plant

40
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,478
so again why focus on nitrogen well even

41
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,359
if levels of all other nutrients are

42
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,438
sufficient

43
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,478
you may still need to add nitrogen each

44
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,079
year

45
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,920
despite the many different nutrients in

46
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,798
the soil nitrogen is likely to be

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,359
deficient

48
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,118
if not managed properly nitrogen is

49
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,640
variable so understanding and managing

50
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,400
it can be a challenge

51
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,719
proper management of nitrogen will help

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,920
ensure optimum crop performance

53
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,840
and minimize minimizes potential

54
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,879
negative environmental impacts

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,719
and the reason why you need to

56
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,599
continually usually fertilize with

57
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,200
nitrogen

58
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,199
is because it has a tendency to leach

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,118
from the soil while other minerals be

60
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,520
tend to hold in the soil a little bit

61
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,680
longer nitrogen has a tendency to leach

62
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,000
out from year to year so we're looking

63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,118
at nitrogen recommendations related to a

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
soil test

65
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,200
keep in mind that since nitrogen levels

66
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,960
can fluctuate widely depending on

67
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,719
environmental conditions

68
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,959
and can change during the shipping

69
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,318
process of that soil test as it goes

70
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,959
from where you sampled it

71
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,919
to the lab this element is not measured

72
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,080
in a routine

73
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,119
soil test this is why there is this

74
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
thing called a june

75
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,400
nitrate test which tested specifically

76
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,719
and only

77
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
for nitrogen the nitrogen

78
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,800
recommendations are based on crop

79
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
needs as an estimate by field studies

80
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,480
combined with presumptives

81
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,399
of the presumption that little available

82
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,560
nitrogen remains in the soil

83
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,159
at the end of the growing season and

84
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,920
here we just see some examples of

85
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,120
looking at nitrogen recommendations

86
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,799
looking at cotton

87
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,039
and ancient removal and pounds per

88
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,879
bushel of corn and soybeans

89
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,439
so again it's good that you have some

90
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,120
sort of crop to match this up with

91
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,560
but hopefully with all these can kind of

92
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,680
develop that general sense

93
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,239
of what's a good target level when we're

94
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,360
taking

95
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,959
a june nitrate test so the nitrogen

96
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
cycle now nitrogen has many different

97
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,239
chemical forms

98
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,840
and it changes as part of the full

99
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,640
nitrogen cycle

100
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,479
some are more pla available than others

101
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,399
that's an important consideration

102
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,639
not all nitrogen can be uptaken by

103
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,640
plants nitrogen makes up the vast

104
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,518
majority of the air about 78 percent

105
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,199
but this is only usable by legumes which

106
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,400
can fix this form into other plant

107
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,839
available forms

108
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
so even though plants are constantly

109
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,920
exposed to atmospheric nitrogen

110
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,598
which is the vast majority 78 of the air

111
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,919
around them most plants other than

112
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,798
legumes cannot utilize that form of

113
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,399
nitrogen

114
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,280
you're looking at mainly the nitrates

115
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,879
being what's being able to be absorbed

116
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,959
by plants here also some ammonia as well

117
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,798
but others can be leeched out and not

118
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,400
uptaken by plants so not only do we need

119
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
nitrogen in the soil

120
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,480
and around the plant we need it in the

121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,158
proper form for uptake

122
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,840
so what are some commercial nitrogen

123
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,158
fertilizers we have the ammonia

124
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,799
which includes anhydrous ammonia and at

125
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:59,359
room temperature ammonia is a colorless

126
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,400
pungent smelling gas that is lighter

127
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,799
than air

128
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,158
at minus 28 degrees fahrenheit ammonia

129
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,879
is stored as a liquid

130
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,399
and ammonia easily dissolves in water

131
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,639
this makes it an efficient form

132
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,799
of delivery to plants but it must be

133
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,000
injected below the soil surface to be

134
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,280
delivered to plants so it's

135
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,238
not commonly done in rocky soils need to

136
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,159
literally be

137
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,439
injected below the soil surface and it's

138
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,639
going right along we're going to go

139
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,079
through and inject it below the soil

140
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,000
surface and cover it up

141
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,680
if you have rocky soils the kind of the

142
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
point of injection can break

143
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,840
and therefore it's typically not used in

144
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,519
soils that tend to be very rocky or

145
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,399
regions of the country that tend to be

146
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,279
rocky

147
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,679
calcium nitrate of 1500 is water-soluble

148
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,559
and

149
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,680
fast-acting form of nitrogen fertilizer

150
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,759
urea is very potent it's 46.00 46

151
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,079
nitrogen it's a very efficient source of

152
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,840
nitrogen but requires soil microbes to

153
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,719
change its form of nitrogen

154
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,719
to become plant available it's best if

155
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,320
incorporated into the soil or watered in

156
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,639
shortly after application

157
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,319
to avoid nitrogen being lost to

158
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,680
volatilization where it becomes a gas

159
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,639
and goes into the atmosphere

160
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,478
and not uptaken by the plant there's

161
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,160
also organic forms of nitrogen

162
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,519
fertilizer such as manures

163
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,199
they can have high levels of plant

164
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,560
available amounts of nitrogen

165
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,720
but you want to watch the type of

166
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,399
bedding that may come with the manure

167
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,080
for example if it's sawdust or other

168
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,918
fine wood products this will reduce the

169
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,680
amount of plant available nitrogen

170
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,599
because it should be uptaken as part of

171
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,840
the decomposition process

172
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
of that sawdust then there's soil

173
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,799
organic matter

174
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,919
and nitrogen is released in the process

175
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,879
of mineralization

176
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,359
as organic matter as soil microbes break

177
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,959
down

178
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,479
that organic matter we kind of have this

179
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,758
kind of process going on

180
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,159
the soil when it gets to a proper

181
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,439
temperature then there's a blood meal

182
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,240
here this has a 12 1

183
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,800
0 12 nitrogen it's a high nitrogen

184
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,079
content

185
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,199
organic fertilizer now changing forms of

186
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,599
nitrogen as you see we have

187
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,000
nitrification which is the biological

188
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,479
process of converting ammonia just nh4

189
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
plus

190
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,279
to nitrates the nitrate n is negatively

191
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,080
charged as we can see right here

192
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,399
in ion that is not attracted to soil

193
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,560
particles or soil organic matter

194
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,560
like the ammonium is so it's more

195
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,918
commonly easy to leach

196
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
you have two negative particles they're

197
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,959
going to kind of repel one another as a

198
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
result that's going to have a tendency

199
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,439
to leach

200
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,280
out of the soil then there's

201
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,680
denitrification which is bacteria

202
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,198
converting no3 to no2 gas

203
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,038
and that would kind of the no2 gas would

204
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,560
be lost to the atmosphere

205
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,159
that'd be through the process here of

206
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,079
volatilization

207
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
then with immobilization this is when

208
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,478
nitrogen is assembled into compounds

209
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,400
or materials that is not available such

210
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:34,959
as plant residues it's another way we

211
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,359
can quote

212
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,318
lose nitrogen or have nitrogen that

213
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,240
cannot be

214
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,840
of benefit to the crop we're trying to

215
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,319
grow

216
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,918
now how can nitrogen be lost and i say

217
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,759
lost in the sense that

218
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,519
we know where it goes but loss in the

219
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,680
sense it cannot be uptaked

220
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,719
or utilized by the plant we're intending

221
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
to grow

222
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
there can be leaching and this is

223
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,400
physically loss of nitrogen due

224
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,560
excess water additions it's most likely

225
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,879
to occur in sandier soils

226
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,879
that denitrification is typical loss of

227
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,478
nitrate forms when soil is saturated

228
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,038
with water for two to three days

229
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,639
particularly prolonged rain events

230
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,399
volatilization is when the surface

231
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,400
applied nitrogen is not incorporated

232
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,758
into the soil which is applied on top

233
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,000
because this can lead to nitrogen being

234
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,080
lost to the air conditions that

235
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,959
increase the rate of volatilization is a

236
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,519
soil ph higher than 7.3

237
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,120
also hot air temperatures and a moist

238
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,318
soil surface if you're in the hot of

239
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,360
summer

240
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,520
on a basic soil with just after a rain

241
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
it's going to improve the efficiency to

242
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,000
be volatile volatilized

243
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,439
and not uptaken by the plant there's

244
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,399
also crop removal we must take into

245
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,240
consideration

246
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,399
this is simply removing plant material

247
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
that has nitrogen in it will naturally

248
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,519
reduce nitrogen in the soil

249
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,360
this is actually how the majority of

250
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,198
nitrogen leaves the soil system

251
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,199
when the crop is harvested and taken off

252
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,598
site the nitrogen that's in that plant

253
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,478
is also removed with it then there's

254
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,240
soil erosion

255
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,639
and runoff and these should be minimized

256
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,918
for the reasons in addition to nitrogen

257
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,720
loss but also don't want to be losing

258
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,478
your soil

259
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,120
this is why cover crops are highly

260
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,800
recommended in open fields

261
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,478
now there's two key forms of nitrogen as

262
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
i said that ammonium and that

263
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,240
nitrate form while there are many forms

264
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,520
and nitrogen clean both organic and

265
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,840
inorganic forms

266
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,038
plants can only use these two forms

267
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,519
plants only take up

268
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,399
inorganic nitrogen in the form of no3

269
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,598
nitrate

270
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,519
or nh4 plus in the ammonium

271
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,360
so all other forms of nitrogen are

272
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,680
intermediate forms

273
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,278
and cannot be directly utilized by the

274
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,918
plant they might be important in the

275
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:35,519
cycle

276
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,439
but as far as what the plant can uptake

277
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,200
these are the only two forms that the

278
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,159
plant can uptake

279
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,959
so which one is better well in short

280
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:44,958
neither

281
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,799
just remember that nitrate is always

282
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,039
present in the soil solution

283
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,479
and will move with soil water so again

284
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,919
keep that in mind that

285
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
it's not like oh i want to choose one

286
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,799
versus another they both can be utilized

287
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,958
by the plants we're looking at those

288
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,039
conversion forms of nitrogen

289
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,159
inhibiting the conversion of our

290
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,360
ammonium

291
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,079
to nitrate can result in less nitrogen

292
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,759
loss

293
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,519
in more plant uptake because the whole

294
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,080
goal through this entire process

295
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,879
is this important part here of plant

296
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,120
uptake

297
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,120
you can see we see here the nitrate form

298
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
the ammonium form can both be uptaken by

299
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,600
the plant they're the only forms

300
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,680
our goal here is to limit the chance of

301
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,839
this being converted or leeched

302
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,278
or this being kind of immobilized or

303
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,120
this kind of being leached out of the

304
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,240
soil or part of the soil runoff or

305
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,919
volatilized

306
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,000
we want to make sure we're having its

307
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,159
greatest percentage that we can

308
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,759
going through plant so we're not losing

309
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,838
a whole bunch we're not wasting a lot of

310
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,919
that fertilizer

311
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,279
as how can we reduce the waste of

312
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,199
nitrogen fertilizer well

313
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,559
growers can work on ideally the timing

314
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
of that fertilizer

315
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,599
if plants are fertilized too early the

316
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,080
risk for lost

317
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,000
nitrogen does increase growers should

318
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,879
try in timely application with plant

319
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,399
uptake

320
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,480
so what does that mean well here we have

321
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,360
a corn plant as just an example

322
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,639
we fertilize very early we're going to

323
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
lose a lot because the roots are going

324
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,159
to be small

325
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,278
and also the demand for nitrogen is

326
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,919
reduced

327
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,879
when we're looking at the corn again as

328
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,159
another example

329
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,879
3 7 of nitrogen taken up by post-post

330
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,199
flowering

331
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,120
66 nitrogen taken up by a flowering

332
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,720
phase so we're looking at fertilizing

333
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,078
we want to time that for a little bit

334
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,278
later in the growth cycle when the

335
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:24,879
demand goes up

336
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,480
because what that's going to do is allow

337
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,399
our nitrogen in the soil

338
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,959
to be uptaken by the plant at a greater

339
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,440
efficiency simply because the plant is

340
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,679
demanding greater amounts of it

341
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,279
so as promised were some common for

342
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,359
nitrogen fertilizer

343
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,679
recommendations you know what would i

344
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,399
kind of in general kind of recommend

345
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,199
and just some common fertilizers calcium

346
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,078
nitrate

347
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,680
is great to use when soils are colder

348
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,679
for more plant available form

349
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,359
but it's only 15 percent nitrogen you

350
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,719
have to take that into consideration

351
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,399
that calcium nitrate is very plant

352
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,720
available but only 15

353
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,360
nitrogen compared to some of the others

354
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,480
urea is great when the soils are warmer

355
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,159
but be sure to water it in to avoid

356
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,200
potential volatization

357
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,559
and this is 48 nitrogen i make that

358
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,160
distinction

359
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,599
because if you're adding a pound of

360
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,799
calcium nitrate

361
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,800
in a pound of urea and think they're oh

362
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,439
they're both nitrogen fertilizer

363
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,039
that pound of calcium is 15 percent and

364
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,160
and that penetrates 48

365
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,599
in if we can scale this up to 100 pounds

366
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,838
of calcium nitrate

367
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,079
of that hundred pounds of fertilizer

368
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,399
only 15 of that would be nitrogen

369
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,439
comparing that to urea 100 pounds of

370
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,839
urea

371
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
48 almost half of that is going to be

372
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,880
nitrogen

373
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,240
so keep in mind that there is no best

374
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,000
form of nitrogen

375
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,600
trying to better understand this taking

376
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,958
a june nitrate test

377
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
there's other videos on that here on

378
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,958
this channel that you're welcome to take

379
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
a look at

380
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,879
to try to better understand nitrogen why

381
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,879
because you typically need to add it

382
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,799
every year and it does change quite

383
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,799
frequently so being able to best

384
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,879
understand the conditions and the

385
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,639
process and cycle of nitrogen

386
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,958
will help you make a better grower and

387
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,959
help improve your plant performance
