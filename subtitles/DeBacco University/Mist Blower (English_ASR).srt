1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,448
here I'm going to talk to you about a

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,669
mist blower and this is the actual one

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:07,740
that I use in my operation and while I

4
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:10,439
was a little bit hesitant to purchase

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,169
originally now that I have purchased it

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:16,948
I can see a lot of uses and it has saved

7
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,868
me a lot of time labor and money so miss

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,390
blower I can allow for efficient

9
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:24,149
nutrient applications as it produces

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,070
small droplets or mist so we're looking

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,079
at our water droplets produces this fine

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,210
little mess it's basically a leaf blower

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,009
that dribbles some water and it turns

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,710
what would be large droplets into these

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,128
fine mist droplets allowing for very

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,160
efficient coverage miss blur saves times

17
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,140
quick coverage provides better coverage

18
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,569
but then the traditional pump sprayer

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,329
like it's the tops and bottoms of the

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,159
leaves very quickly as we see this grow

21
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,370
replicated with a different name brand

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,718
here but serves the same purpose

23
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:57,390
efficient coverage of top and bottom

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,010
sides of the leaves and this blur allows

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,020
you to use less product so it offers a

26
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:03,780
cost savings I notice this with the one

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,570
that I have used mine is paid for itself

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,460
just in product savings not to mention

29
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:11,399
the time and labor savings so if you're

30
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,438
applying any sort of products if I was

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,439
using a regular pump sprayer I was using

32
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,899
a lot more volume for more time in less

33
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,569
efficient coverage this now allows more

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,549
efficient coverage and less time so

35
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:26,250
while they are can be expensive for an

36
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,368
initial investment - paid for itself now

37
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,140
miss blur can also help of the lobster

38
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:32,938
arm or that one big arm as you're kind

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,769
of going through and kind of pumping up

40
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:38,158
that sprayer the entire time the gas

41
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,719
powered sprayer it takes care of that on

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,118
this blower downfall is it can be heavy

43
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,879
but there are now two different sizes at

44
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,009
least by steel I have the four gallon

45
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,078
which is 28 pounds they also make a

46
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,329
small two gallons only weighs 17 pounds

47
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:54,118
with their weed whacker motor I've

48
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,819
sprayed water with the 2 gallon one with

49
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,099
a friend of mine and it does just as

50
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,449
good a job as the four gallon one only

51
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,250
downfalls you have to fill it up a

52
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,960
little bit more often but considering

53
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,328
the weight savings and this is of course

54
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,159
without water in it considering the

55
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:11,068
weight savings that can be a great

56
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,900
option for someone timing is everything

57
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,799
so take advantage of a weather window

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,990
for an ideal

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,120
Brahe day may not match your schedule so

60
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,290
sometimes it's a matter of oh I just I

61
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,349
don't have enough time to spray today

62
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:24,840
but pulling it was quicker having this

63
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,609
method of application it's efficient can

64
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,830
help increase the odds that it gets done

65
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,990
that's part of what the mist blowers

66
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,510
allowed me is quick catch a weather

67
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,100
window go ahead and apply you had

68
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:37,139
efficient coverage at useless product

69
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,789
use it in less time rinse it out and

70
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,789
you're good to go for the next day
