1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,990
so here we're going to get water

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,400
regulation in the human body I have a

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,769
separate video with osmoregulation

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,809
relating to fish here we're gonna look

5
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:13,079
at the human body this is an extreme

6
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:15,239
case of water dehydration in the case of

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,028
the mummy here looking a little bit more

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,829
of a realistic situation here

9
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:21,689
antidiuretic hormone ADH is apartment

10
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,259
negative feedback system that regulates

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,879
water in the mammalian body pH increases

12
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,279
the permeability of distal tubules

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,018
allowing for greater water recovery so

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,289
for example a person is given a dose of

15
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:36,149
ADH then more water will be retained by

16
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,390
the kidneys so how does this look at an

17
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,679
actual situation so if we're outside a

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,239
heat will cause water loss through

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,859
dehydration through the process of

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,530
sweating receptors in the hypothalamus

21
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:49,259
soak it in the brain detect the

22
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,460
increased blood as molarity and signaled

23
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,799
the pituitary gland

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,320
it's the pituitary gland located right

25
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,988
here that will release ADH into the

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,829
bloodstream when that ADH is released

27
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:01,140
into the bloodstream

28
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,480
that will cause an increase in the

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,909
permeability of the distal tubule and

30
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,158
then nephron and clean the collecting

31
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,260
duct this allows more water to be

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,330
reabsorbed into the blood to get our

33
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,359
nephron structure and water will be

34
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:18,390
retained in the body and concentrated

35
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,590
urine is produced so that urine is

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,900
concentrated because the buyers

37
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,420
retaining more water meaning that is

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,180
excreting less water concentrating the

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,079
air and giving it more of a yellow to

40
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,540
dark yellow appearance now caffeine and

41
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,728
alcohol and in diuretics alcohol

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,670
inhibits ADH release while caffeine

43
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:40,769
interferes with its activity part of the

44
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,560
synonyms of a hangover are actually due

45
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:45,780
to dehydration so what causes

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,530
dehydration in this case and why is a

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,129
cup of coffee

48
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,719
not a good cure for a hangover so look

49
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,759
at some of the items here we have our

50
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,728
Brut coffee I think in this comparison

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,149
the highest amount of caffeine per cup

52
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:00,840
instant coffee

53
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,939
redbull black tea Kenneth's Cola a shot

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,920
of expresso green tea is decreasing it

55
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,898
decaffeinated coffee then we'll have

56
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,789
less caffeine because it is

57
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,739
decaffeinated but it still does not

58
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:14,000
contain zero contains less but not

59
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,259
completely owned in it entirely

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,879
direct directs and weight loss so many

61
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,849
over-the-counter herbal diet aids

62
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,439
claim to detoxify the body or flesh fat

63
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,560
out of the body well many of these

64
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,599
contain dandelion leaves or parsley or

65
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,430
other herbs known to be diuretics which

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,129
increase the amount of water and salt

67
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,110
expelled from the body as you urine so

68
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,030
if that's the case we want to consider

69
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,860
if a person tries one of these products

70
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,650
it appears to lose pounds were they

71
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,810
actually losing they actually losing fat

72
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,150
they are losing weight but is it

73
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,370
actually in the form of fat so consider

74
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,219
what's going on you particular with the

75
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,780
kidneys also if they can see disease for

76
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,550
an extended period of time could be

77
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,069
health problems associated these

78
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,040
products that are clinging to flush site

79
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,870
and detoxify the body if they're

80
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,729
diuretics an increasing amount of water

81
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,840
and salt expelled from the body's urine

82
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:09,899
so consider that also in a last case the

83
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,030
king of rap now this long tale

84
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,310
okay regret is adapted for the desert

85
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,710
life and being able to survive with very

86
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,930
little water I want you to consider some

87
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,360
ways in which it's kidneys it might be

88
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,969
different from the human kidney to let

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,550
to conserve as much water as possible it

90
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:28,319
lives in a very arid environment you may

91
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,790
say looking at the pictures here well I

92
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,650
can just get water from the plant it

93
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:33,449
just eats the plants well there's not a

94
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,360
lot of plants available in the desert

95
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:38,939
environment so it has kidneys adapted to

96
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,040
help it survive with very little water

97
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,709
so I want you to consider how the

98
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,989
kidneys of the Karoo wrap may differ

99
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,479
from a human kidney what might be going

100
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:52,790
on there to help it live in an

101
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,789
environment where water is very scarce
