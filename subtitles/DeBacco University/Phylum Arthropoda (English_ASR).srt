1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,830
as the title suggests we're gonna be

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,000
looking at the animal phylum Arthropoda

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,378
okay I've just kind of put this here to

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,990
hope to get you to remember and how to

5
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:12,239
pronounce the proper term there then you

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,269
can see some species located within this

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,000
phylum now what makes this particular

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,980
fiim unique is the advent of jointed

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,679
appendages now this is the most

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,778
successful of all the animal groups and

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,109
these jointed appendages are one of the

12
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:30,469
key distinguishing factors for this

13
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,679
phylum in addition to that there's also

14
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:36,179
exoskeleton made of chitin the muscles

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,609
attached on the inside of this outer

16
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,988
shells we see here in that outer shell

17
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,780
made of chitin protects against

18
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,878
predators and also water loss you see

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,439
that evident right here it's very hard

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:52,289
type structure now cannot support much

21
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,468
weight so that results in a limiting of

22
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,198
these individuals total size they have

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,570
segments they three in particular that

24
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,179
often fuse into functional groups when

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,969
the animal reaches the adult stage the

26
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:09,390
three segments are the abdomen the

27
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,250
thorax and the head so these are also

28
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,680
important to be identify on these

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,879
particular animals if we do dissections

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,340
up or we want to refer to a specific

31
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,899
region these are the three regions the

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,500
head the thorax and the abdomen you

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,990
should be familiar with now there's

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,390
certain subsets within this phylum that

35
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:30,060
lack jaws coalesce traits one of those

36
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,000
and they just simply they might have

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,200
mouth parts but they lack of jaws

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,959
spiders mite scorpions and horseshoe

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,340
crabs horseshoe crabs are interesting

40
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,639
that we have fossil records going back

41
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,109
about 630 million years ago they're the

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,299
only surviving type of this particular

43
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:50,159
TripIt uh so they're found and they're

44
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,790
not extremely rare found in pretty high

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,770
numbers along the beach in June in Long

46
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,299
Island sounds when they can come in and

47
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:01,319
they tend to group together when they're

48
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,299
mating so that's can be one to be seen I

49
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:07,529
also have one hanging on the wall to

50
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:11,159
preserve specimen isn't that true for

51
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,990
all author through Peter some have

52
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:17,379
actual mouth parts we

53
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,879
all those jaws properly termed mandibles

54
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:20,859
we see that in the human hair

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,439
highlighted in green we also see that at

56
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,210
the ant here these insects centipedes

57
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,169
millipedes have these mandibles which

58
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,129
are specialized mouth parts or jaws

59
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:33,549
maybe a little bit of a shocker of a

60
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:37,329
slide sorry for that our arachnids they

61
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,710
have four pairs of walking legs and then

62
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,600
these two entities are not used for

63
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,610
walking they're just more for feeling

64
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,769
for gathering food items for moving

65
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,310
things but not specifically for walking

66
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:52,210
so within the arachnid species there's

67
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:54,640
about five well 57,000 named species

68
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,530
within this so he just classify them as

69
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,119
spiders and gotcha something in that

70
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,189
category well there's ticks and mites

71
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,490
and daddy longlegs and scorpions and

72
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:07,870
spiders all lumped into this same group

73
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:10,629
of arachnids then these arachnids

74
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,960
there's among the first to live on land

75
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:14,650
going from water to air breathing

76
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,770
scorpions are thought to be one of the

77
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,360
first to make that transition from the

78
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,050
water environment to the land

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,300
environment

80
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,330
the reason is their lungs have a strong

81
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,020
resemblance of king-crab gills

82
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,360
particularly something called the book

83
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,480
log you see that here if you've ever

84
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,510
opened the shell of a crab you see the

85
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:37,359
lungs or gills really here it's very

86
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:39,789
similar to king crabs gills match the

87
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,550
lungs of a scorpion the lungs are

88
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:44,019
specific alongs they're called Booker's

89
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,240
they kind of look like the pages of a

90
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,610
book this is creating a high surface

91
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:53,860
area allowing efficient exchange of

92
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:56,110
oxygen and carbon dioxide these

93
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,260
crustaceans comprise of a diverse group

94
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,970
of mandibles about 35,000 species such

95
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:04,030
as crabs shrimp lobster crayfish and

96
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:06,310
pill bugs some be really small and some

97
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,129
can be quite large and they're all under

98
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:12,659
this same general classification here we

99
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:14,859
can see the diversity that does exist

100
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,209
now most crustaceans have two pairs of

101
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,639
antennae three pairs of two independent

102
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,108
is in various number of the legs you may

103
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,729
we remember from one of my previous

104
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:24,459
videos the importance of knowing your

105
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,169
orientation the dorsal views looking

106
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,489
kind of from the top down here the back

107
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:29,049
of the animal the

108
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,240
central's that underside of that belly

109
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,889
region and here's the side view

110
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,710
let me require you to know all the

111
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,750
individual segments here but again could

112
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:40,180
be advantageous for identification

113
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,899
purposes if we do a dissection of a

114
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,848
crustacean crustacean is just living in

115
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:48,788
New England want to point out some key

116
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:50,740
items here with our lobster we may think

117
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,300
of a lobster in New England the Maine or

118
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,939
American lobster here with its large

119
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,829
claws for most of the world though the

120
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,969
Caribbean or spiny lobster is what most

121
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,668
people think of when they hear the term

122
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,789
lobster so what makes the Maine or

123
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:06,068
American lobster so desired all over the

124
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:08,288
world its large claws the meat in its

125
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,960
claws you can see the Caribbean or spiny

126
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:13,269
lobster has a good tail meat region but

127
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,989
not really anything in great in the claw

128
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:18,038
vision millipedes and centipedes I just

129
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,780
want to highlight some differences

130
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:22,269
between these two mill peas and sanity's

131
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:23,918
have bodies that consist of hard head

132
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:26,500
region I'm sorry followed by numerous

133
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,448
segments today's are centipede and

134
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,129
here's our millipede you notice

135
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:32,199
immediately there's some very key

136
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,699
differences between the two and being

137
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,639
able to identify two different Hooten

138
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,310
two is important so let's go over some

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,009
of the key things to look for centipedes

140
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,370
have one pair of legs per segment while

141
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:48,189
millipedes have two legs per segment

142
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,468
also centipedes tend to be carnivorous

143
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:52,598
meaning they eat in this case this was

144
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:55,149
eating sadly a mouse set get caught in

145
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:58,180
the trap millipedes are herbivores and

146
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:59,918
they eat mean the eat plants so if you

147
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,019
ever have the option if you want to be

148
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:05,109
put into a tank of millipedes or

149
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:07,598
centipedes despite the more legs

150
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,669
I'd go with millipedes because they're

151
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,379
gonna be looking for a plant to eat and

152
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:14,560
not wanting to take a bite out of you

153
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:16,930
like a centipede may lastly we have our

154
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,430
insects this is the largest group they

155
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,949
are the most abundant eukaryotes on

156
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,300
earth and insects have those three

157
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,639
distinctive regions that I talked about

158
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,560
the abdomen thorax and the head and

159
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,870
they're the most versus is what makes

160
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,089
the reason why this particular phylum is

161
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,439
considered to be the most successful if

162
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:35,468
you're looking at number of species

163
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,250
simply because of insects are the most

164
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:39,810
abundant

165
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,810
eukaryotes on earth
