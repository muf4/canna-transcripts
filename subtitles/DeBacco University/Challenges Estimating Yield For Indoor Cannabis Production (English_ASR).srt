00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,400
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,639
we'll be looking at challenges

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,710
estimating yield for indoor cannabis

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,788
production

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,788
[Music]

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,118
[Music]

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,480
so a lot of growers asked well how does

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,000
indoor compare to outdoor what's going

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
to be my yield for an indoor

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,039
i'm going to go over some of the

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,439
complexities while there's not just a

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,320
quick

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,198
short answer to that question so first

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,800
off looking at this

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,720
reference article here which is where

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,839
i've pulled the data from that you're

17
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,359
going to see

18
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,719
keep in mind that this article was kind

19
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,799
of looking at it more from an

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
investigation forensics kind of

21
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,558
angle but it does provide some good

22
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,399
information

23
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,320
so they first looked at of course you

24
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,480
know looking at gross revenue

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,799
when we're looking at gross revenue for

26
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,599
our indoor grow operations

27
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,399
and they had four areas for rooms i

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,640
should say

29
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,840
that were under the investigation here

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
they're looking at the

31
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,280
room numbers the number of cycles number

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
of plants were grown

33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,120
sales this was in the netherlands so it

34
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,680
is euros per kilogram

35
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,679
yield per plant in grams yield per cycle

36
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,000
total yield and gross revenue

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,080
the multiplication of the later prices

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
and the total yield in the table above

39
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,359
reveals the gross revenues we see here

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,600
obtained in each

41
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,280
growth room according to the court with

42
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,599
a correction for the assumed

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,719
number of growth cycles in the first

44
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,000
growth room there

45
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,519
so again there are some assumptions

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,640
being made here we can see the number of

47
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,840
plants

48
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,879
being as low as 266 and as high as over

49
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,478
5 000.

50
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,560
the total gross revenue from all grow

51
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,599
rooms together is an estimated to have

52
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,240
been

53
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:41,599
over 5.5 million euros over the period

54
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,798
from august 6 2005 to march 2009

55
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,679
this is again what they were

56
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,280
investigating as part of this article

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,118
so why is it again so hard to kind of

58
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
like look in all these suspected pros

59
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,920
here

60
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,680
well the judicial file on the case study

61
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
also mentions revenue estimates provided

62
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,000
by the grower based on its claims and

63
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,239
yield

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,359
number of growth cycles and prices paid

65
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,239
by the buyers

66
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,959
so these are just more confounding data

67
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,039
points

68
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,078
that make it difficult to pinpoint or

69
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,239
get an exact

70
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,840
number now what's the total yield yeah

71
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,479
that's one thing what's the number of

72
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,560
plants

73
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,319
where are the buyers willing to pay for

74
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,080
it so this is what causes that source of

75
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,280
potential confusion

76
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,640
now if you're looking at what can we

77
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
glean from this what can be information

78
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,479
can we get

79
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,840
what data should we be collecting so if

80
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,759
the courts are collecting it's probably

81
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,159
a good idea for us to also be collecting

82
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,079
it

83
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,079
as a qualitative data gathering on

84
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,920
cannabis cultivation activities

85
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,760
focus on directly observable of

86
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,079
observable and measurable data to be

87
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,239
collected upon confiscation of cannabis

88
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,160
plantations are strongly encouraged by

89
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,640
police and judicial actors

90
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,400
so what information are they collecting

91
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,639
what information should growers be

92
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,159
keeping track of and that should be the

93
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,159
number of plants it seems kind of

94
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,439
obvious the plant densities so how big

95
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,840
of an area how many plants

96
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,680
in per square meter per square foot

97
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
what's the surface being cultivated it's

98
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
the pot volume it's in the container

99
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,679
volume being grown in

100
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,599
the lamp number how many lights the type

101
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
and power of those lights

102
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,719
the type of number of installations i

103
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,519
know the lights but maybe the hvac

104
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,439
system the

105
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,039
cooling system the heating system

106
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,560
equipment and fertilizer containers

107
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,158
as well as many other things but these

108
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,920
are just some key points

109
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,919
growers should be keeping track of to

110
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,199
ensure they have a successful operation

111
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,598
but with just the

112
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,199
short list provided here we can see the

113
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,878
variability and that's why it makes it

114
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,439
very difficult to estimate

115
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,199
yields and especially yields over a long

116
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,199
period of time because some of them will

117
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,318
these will have a lot of upfront cost

118
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,399
but then reduced

119
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,359
reoccurring cost so again a little

120
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
difficult there

121
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,040
but this just gives you an idea of some

122
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
data presented in the information for

123
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,000
this article that was presented

124
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,000
in a court setting
