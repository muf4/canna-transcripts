1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,779
now looking at plant leaves here

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,609
something we all might take for granted

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:06,528
we kind of assume oh yeah plants have

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,150
leaves

5
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:10,429
hopefully this lecture will try to give

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,660
you a little bit more of an appreciation

7
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:15,298
for some of the complexities and

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,940
differences within leaf structures or

9
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:19,739
different plants so starting with the

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,600
basic leaves are like living solar

11
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,179
panels and the goal is to collect the

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,368
sun's energy so our solar panels are all

13
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:27,989
through the field here so the leaves

14
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,820
their goal is to kind of collect and

15
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,559
absorb as much of that Sun energy as

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,808
possible so that the plant can

17
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:38,100
efficiently carry out the conversion of

18
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:39,750
this light energy to sugars so starting

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,700
in general leaves are usually the most

20
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,738
predominant shoot Oregon and are

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,050
structurally diverse and we see just a

22
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,328
couple examples here growth occurs by

23
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,769
means of marginal meristems and the

24
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,750
marginal meristems grow outward and

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,160
ultimately form the blade portion which

26
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,649
is the flattened portion of the leaf and

27
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,799
once the leaf is fully expanded the

28
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,719
marginal meristems ceased to grow so

29
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,279
once they reach maturity those leaves

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,159
will no longer grow only in the early

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,049
stages will leaves grow and as leaves

32
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,670
are growing as an important note while

33
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,979
we think it leaves always producing

34
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,200
energy when a leaf is very small and its

35
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,030
foot first expanding it may actually be

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,070
a sink it may actually consume more

37
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,349
energy than it provides at maturity

38
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,839
though leaves will definitely produce

39
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,728
more than they ever took initially

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,740
though sometimes they get going that

41
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:27,780
small leaf might be more of a sink than

42
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:31,560
a source until it gets fully mature and

43
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,659
it reaches maximum efficiency so looking

44
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,090
at cross-sectionally so what is a leaf

45
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,350
I try to provide some nice examples here

46
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,840
and try to relate kind of a cartoon

47
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:41,879
image to what a real microscopic image

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,740
may look like so remember our cuticle

49
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,539
located at the top here we go this arrow

50
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,640
will indicate right here at the top is

51
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,340
where the cuticle is the palisade

52
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,379
parenchyma variety this region right

53
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,960
here this is the upper portion a leaf

54
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:58,289
and this is important for absorption of

55
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,179
a lot of sunlight spongy parenchyma here

56
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,509
it's spongy because it needs to allow

57
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,100
for gas exchange and for water exchange

58
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:08,310
and then if you look here our stomata

59
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,868
right allowing for the influx of co2 and

60
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,618
the release of oxygen protected by our

61
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,568
guard cells

62
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,860
well that's located right in this region

63
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:16,409
here is where the stomata would be

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,930
in our Meza filters this entire area

65
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,490
between the upper and lower epidermis

66
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,340
this red region right here this would be

67
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:26,129
the mesophyll section this is a very

68
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,800
high-quality image and hopefully this

69
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,349
kind of cartoon and well-defined image

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,030
here can help you interrelate so when

71
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,099
you look at the real image you're able

72
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,390
to recognize these certain regions on

73
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,799
the leaf cross-section so looking more

74
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:42,000
on a macroscopic something might be a

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,310
little bit more familiar with or the

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,020
leaf parts the notice where attaches to

77
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,390
the steps the noted be down down this

78
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,659
region the petiole here is the leaf

79
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:54,419
stalk the blade is contains a network of

80
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:57,090
veins in vascular bundles and the margin

81
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,949
is the very edge here of the leaf in the

82
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,569
midrib in this case is very strong in

83
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,639
this and the tip would be the very end

84
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,530
the reason why to pick we point out the

85
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,229
margin is that is important potentially

86
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,459
for identification purposes and we may

87
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,259
do a lab where you're kind of

88
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,450
investigating different leaf structures

89
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:14,329
and the margin is one thing you can use

90
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:18,209
for identification

91
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:20,760
so dicots and monocots do differ so i

92
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,099
have some examples here a is a monocot

93
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,780
and this has leaves with parallel

94
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,930
venation mean all the veins are run

95
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,159
parallel to one another in contrast with

96
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,110
pinnate venation

97
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,319
and this is where at least as a main

98
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,720
midrib distinguish it as a dicot so

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,579
here's a strong midrib here and then we

100
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,590
have the network that branches off from

101
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,209
there same thing here is this a

102
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,879
real-world example we have that strongly

103
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,200
driven we have a branching from there

104
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,939
gingko biloba as I put this book called

105
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,469
palmate finish and kind of spreads

106
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,569
things like the palm of your hand kind

107
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,719
of spreading out and that's included by

108
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:58,680
these leaves here remember a ginkgo is a

109
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:01,859
gymnosperm in the same classification of

110
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,900
conifers as pine trees this is just one

111
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,030
example of public elimination

112
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:10,170
this is pinnate venation in essence

113
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:12,989
parallel leaves can also be expressed in

114
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,389
different types of simple or compound

115
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,160
and these are variety of forms that

116
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,899
exists simple leaves are single

117
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,070
undivided blade so you here that's

118
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:24,509
banana tree nice simple leaves then we

119
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:27,329
get into compound leaves they have a

120
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:29,490
blade divided into leaflets so

121
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:31,500
we could see here palmately compound

122
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,470
then compound leaves that leach is

123
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,930
divided and they're divided in a palmate

124
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,690
form then we've pinnately we have that

125
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,269
strung midrib here and then we have

126
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,949
double compound leaves example here all

127
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:46,769
right yes this is kind of like a leaflet

128
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,990
within a leaflet here so these also can

129
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:51,598
be helpful in use for identification of

130
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,240
certain leaves for certain species of

131
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:55,860
plants to kind of give you just kind of

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,870
a quick general cartoon image cool

133
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,340
pinnately compound describe leaflets

134
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,408
that are arranged in pairs along a

135
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:04,079
central axis then palmately compound

136
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:07,680
describe leaflets that reading out from

137
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,870
a common point at the blade end see some

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,288
examples here pinnately the native

139
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,759
paintings lobed hidden compound the

140
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:16,560
compound has those distinctive little

141
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,449
regions lobe we see these definitely

142
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,300
lobe regions and same to you for the

143
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,860
palmately how many don't load we see

144
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,288
some looms developing and prominently

145
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,800
compound so there's almost individual

146
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:30,329
what looks like individual leaves now

147
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,340
how they're organized on the stem is

148
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:34,379
another key factor and something that

149
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,968
you may not notice a lot but when you

150
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,098
start looking at it it can be

151
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:40,319
interesting so the goal is to maximize

152
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:42,778
sunlight exposure this is why leaves are

153
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,848
arranged in different patterns alternate

154
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:46,918
is when leaf spiral around a shoe we see

155
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:49,019
here alternate we see one going here

156
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,089
down when going up when going down up

157
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,218
they're alternating their pattern kind

158
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:56,278
of like left right left right left right

159
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:57,750
is ultimate opposite occurs in the

160
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:59,819
opposite sides of the shoe so here's our

161
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,728
shoe and we have them going in opposite

162
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,259
directions one the left one to the right

163
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:07,258
originating head at that same central

164
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,400
node see that again represented here we

165
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,319
have world which is kind of interesting

166
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,388
these are leaves that circled on the

167
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,189
stem is a group there a world appearance

168
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:15,990
you see the world world in the world

169
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:18,028
here so there are three different types

170
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:22,439
of leaf arrangements and patterns that

171
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:25,228
they have continuing on with that

172
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:28,319
parallel palmately infinitely good three

173
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:29,908
examples here I'm going to parallel that

174
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,539
palmately kind of like the palm of your

175
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:33,060
hand

176
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:35,399
infinitely has that strong midrib and

177
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,978
these veins that we're seeing different

178
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,769
arrangements of are composed of both

179
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:43,050
xylem and phloem

180
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:44,698
now looking at shade leaves may

181
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,680
initially appear similar between these

182
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,710
two but are specialized for their own

183
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,110
particular micro environment they tend

184
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,668
to be larger then our Lessman mesophyll

185
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,379
layers and fewer chloroplast for the

186
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:57,568
shade leaves you can see here the leaves

187
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:00,509
in direct Sun and that much darker

188
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:03,840
region are able to absorb a lot more Sun

189
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:06,000
so that pack in this top region our

190
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,619
shade leaves are a little thinner they

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,110
don't contain quite as many chloroplasts

192
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,788
they're simply not able or exposed to as

193
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,889
much sunlight if they don't build up the

194
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:15,810
reserves like these ones in the Sun

195
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,788
these ones in the Sun higher

196
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,860
photosynthesis rate better exchange with

197
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:21,538
water in carbon dioxide and oxygen

198
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,090
that's why we see a little bit more

199
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:30,449
complexity a little thicker here in the

200
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:31,589
ones exposed to Sun our arid regions go

201
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,840
back from one moment here where it says

202
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:36,299
it tends to be larger that's not thicker

203
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,478
that's larger in area that's kind of

204
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,978
like wider when we say Roger and we can

205
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:44,370
see that and leaves it might be shaded

206
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:46,889
if you have a tree or a like a tomato

207
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,418
plant to the shaded leaves didn't be a

208
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,210
little bit larger or lighter in that

209
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:52,348
case arid region leaves have many

210
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:54,388
modifications to handle these

211
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:56,009
environmental stresses may have

212
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,408
succulent water retaining leaves like

213
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:01,020
this aloe thick leathery leaves if you

214
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:02,819
ever touched an aloe plant fewer and or

215
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:04,709
protected stomata we see here's our

216
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,658
stomata a self stomata but they're

217
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:09,478
recessed into the leaf a little bit more

218
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:11,189
but not located right at the surface of

219
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,788
the underside here they're recessed a

220
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:17,158
little more protecting them eliminating

221
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:18,418
water from leaving as easily creating a

222
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:22,519
little bit more of environment that can

223
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:24,568
handle the some of the more arid regions

224
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,129
aquatic environment leaves this is kind

225
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,569
of an interesting though the stomata we

226
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:30,449
present in higher numbers and the leaves

227
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:32,908
upper surface so these lily pads because

228
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,379
they're floating in water if they had

229
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:36,000
this Timon on the underside it would be

230
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,158
able to breathe they had a higher

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,200
percentage of stomata on the upper side

232
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,578
of the leaves as we see here which is

233
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,850
not characteristic of most of the other

234
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:46,409
plants that we've seen for gas exchange

235
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:48,389
wanted to be protected well in this case

236
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:51,028
if the underside is immersed in water so

237
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:54,409
therefore we dab it on the upper side so

238
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:56,929
they can more efficiently exchange gases

239
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,919
now they're specialized lease here are

240
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:59,509
called tendrils

241
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,370
she looked closely at our pea plants

242
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,220
they have these little tendrils that

243
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,720
will grab onto the cages that we have

244
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,240
grapes are another example in squash

245
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,370
plants this helps support on the stems

246
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,110
as they grow these technically well they

247
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,669
look like little curlicues they're

248
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:18,110
technically modified leaves other leaves

249
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:20,059
are insect trapping losses are very

250
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,990
specialized our pitcher plant they look

251
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,479
like little pitchers

252
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,029
flies will fall in here I mean it

253
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,680
trapped and then slowly get digested

254
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:29,569
these tend make plants in all three of

255
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,549
these cases where nitrogen is very low

256
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,970
because they're basically breaking down

257
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:36,289
the flies AHS in nitrogen source sunny

258
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,149
does he look like these little kind of

259
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:40,819
little water droplets well these are

260
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:42,470
extremely sticky and if a fly or bug was

261
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,379
to land on these he'd be stuck here and

262
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,000
then the plant can consume them and the

263
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:49,189
obvious one the Venus flytrap when the

264
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,110
flow slice lies in it tingles these

265
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,810
little fibers and then these close up

266
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,340
and they will eventually consume the fly

267
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:59,659
again to get some of the proteins in

268
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:02,509
nitrogen from those flies just some

269
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:04,730
general waste to help organize or

270
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:06,080
identify certain plants you don't have

271
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,639
to be responsible for all these

272
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,740
different types but when we do

273
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,240
identification of certain leaves these

274
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,580
slides might be helpful so you're

275
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,169
welcome to pause them and try to compare

276
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,210
what leaf sample you may have and how it

277
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,829
relates when we talked about a couple of

278
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,019
these appalled mainly the one example

279
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,720
here you can see there's many different

280
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:25,429
shapes and arrangements two leaves also

281
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,529
we talked about that margin being very

282
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:30,799
important on there are different types

283
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:32,240
of margins that we can look at and these

284
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,889
are different classifications that we

285
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,720
have to help identify certain leaves and

286
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,620
last we have a nation it talked about

287
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,300
some of the similar one needs to

288
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,639
parallel the palmately independently

289
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:45,139
both there's even more than that so

290
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,569
again very important for identification

291
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:50,299
purposes and kept on these nice large

292
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,340
slides to help you be able to cross

293
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:54,829
compare if you're trying to Ananias

294
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,540
sample leaf putting it all together

295
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,300
these are the all the different types

296
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:02,469
here and again I highlight each on its

297
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:02,469
own individual slide
