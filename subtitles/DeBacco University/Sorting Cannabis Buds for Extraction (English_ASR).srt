00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,799
when it comes to sorting cannabis some

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,960
buds are just destined for extraction

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,240
and this debaco university video can

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,960
provide you with a little bit more

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,849
detail

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,920
and buds that go into this particular

7
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:17,670

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,800
all right let's look at sorting canvas

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,479
buds destined for extraction

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,480
all right so in this case buds for

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,719
extraction the goal is not to focus on

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,238
high quality looking flower

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,920
since the end product will essentially

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,359
be the same the extract

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,679
so we're not looking so much at the

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,200
aesthetics of the actual bud

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,799
this is more common for outdoor

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,480
production simply because the buds

21
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,320
produce tend to be more variable

22
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,759
and not visually as appealing as those

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,200
with indoor operations

24
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,719
so initially we might be going through

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,760
and selecting out maybe the high grade

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,759
buds

27
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,359
mid grade we could potentially go either

28
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,280
way but low grade

29
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,679
typically is going to be for extraction

30
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,679
we're basing that on the visual

31
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,719
aspect and if they don't kind of look

32
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,280
like they're going to be that high

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
quality

34
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,760
looking or high quality aesthetics then

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,799
a lot of times those buds will go into

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,359
the category

37
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,799
to be extracted now why would you go

38
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,560
through extraction well in mass

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,680
production situations for extraction

40
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
there is less need

41
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
for this time-consuming art of trimming

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,079
to make those buds look

43
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,438
as good as they possibly can this can

44
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,000
also be important if you're looking to

45
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,319
produce

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,079
certain compounds and not a final showy

47
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,679
dry flower as an end product

48
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,118
looking for a certain terpene profile

49
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
certain terpenes

50
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,118
specifically or just a cannabinoid

51
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,159
extract there's no sense in kind of

52
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,078
going through the

53
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,680
delicate process of producing the dry

54
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,839
flour if you're looking at really

55
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,118
isolating that particular compound

56
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,520
that's why you'd go through this

57
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,959
extraction process

58
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,798
also as a grower you need to know what

59
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,279
you can produce if you have a process

60
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,280
dialed

61
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,960
in the odds of producing high quality

62
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,118
dry flour are greater

63
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,199
however if this would be a struggle an

64
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,560
extraction might be the way to go if you

65
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,439
know the quality of buds that you're

66
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,879
going to produce

67
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,879
are not going to be that great visually

68
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,039
looking not going to be that kind of

69
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,158
super a grade you might want to go

70
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
through and just

71
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,680
have a plan to go through the process of

72
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,758
extraction

73
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,599
to produce that end product that way

74
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,238
instead of a final

75
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,639
dry flower product so if you're looking

76
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,400
at

77
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,000
targeting a compound while extraction

78
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,719
will be able to remove individual

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,639
components

80
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,159
you may want to try and target one and

81
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,000
select a variety

82
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,680
or cultivar that is known to produce

83
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,840
high amounts of that material

84
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
to maximize the extract concentrate that

85
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,959
you look at producing

86
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,479
since the extracts again can have some

87
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,000
variable whether you're looking at dry

88
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,318
flour being the bud

89
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,360
going to raw oil refined distillate or

90
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,199
isolate

91
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
you can see the different levels here

92
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,958
there's a certain

93
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,719
end product that you're really looking

94
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
at trying to determine

95
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,159
that's what i want to produce well try

96
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,400
to pick a

97
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,680
cultivar try to pick a variety that is

98
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,039
known to produce a little bit higher

99
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,760
value

100
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,039
of that particular goal product in the

101
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,598
sense that the

102
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,079
whole growing process ideally you'll get

103
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,959
more

104
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,879
yield on your investment simply because

105
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,680
you'll have a greater amount of extract

106
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,120
in the end

107
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,040
this is where it comes in not looking at

108
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,920
producing a high quality visual looking

109
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,318
dry flower

110
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,919
looking at producing high quality

111
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,199
chemicals and components

112
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,199
within the plant
