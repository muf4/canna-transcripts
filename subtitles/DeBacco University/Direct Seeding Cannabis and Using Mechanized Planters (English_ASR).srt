00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,439
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,439
where we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,879
direct seeding cannabis and using

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,280
mechanized planters for cannabis growing

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,599
at a large scale and while it is this

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,759
will be a talk specifically on canvas it

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,710
this has been used for many other crops

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:26,800
just here applying it to cannabis

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:29,279
[Music]

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,880
all right let's get into the video here

11
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,880
so first off we have to consider

12
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,320
uh germination and just the basics of

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,239
that this in the sense that you're

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
getting a seed from a certified source

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,479
keeping that temperature in the upper 80

16
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,679
upper 70s to low 80s

17
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,718
fahrenheit mid 20s to upper 20s degrees

18
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,479
celsius

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,160
moisture level around 90 percent

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,238
relative humidity air

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,919
roots and plants still need to breathe

22
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,279
and respire so about 10 percent

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,960
planting depth you only want an eighth

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,960
to quarter of an inch deep or three

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,280
millimeters to six millimeters deep and

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,120
light 150 300 power reading

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,719
particularly if you're growing indoors

28
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,319
outdoors they really don't have a choice

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,799
they'll have to toughen up relatively

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,599
quickly now timing of planting you want

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,360
to ideally

32
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,199
match ideal conditions i put ideal

33
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,719
conditions there in quotes because

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,320
while the weather cannot be controlled

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,759
trying to time the planting around

36
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,519
when it may be similar to ideal

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,599
conditions will help ensure maximum

38
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,519
chance of a good field stand

39
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,199
you don't want to knowingly plant all of

40
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,000
your plants in conditions that are not

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,079
favorable

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
sometimes that does happen but at least

43
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,359
you want to put the odds in your favor

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,400
looking at weather data looking at

45
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,560
timing of year

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,840
so hopefully you can time it with a good

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,000
weather pattern that you might be

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,240
experiencing in your area

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
so springtime so while planting dates

50
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,798
can partic

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,159
partially be determined by weather

52
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,920
however knowing what type of cannabis

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,200
category you're using will influence

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,399
your decision

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
what does that mean well using

56
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,359
autoflowers you want to try to select

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,438
the most ideal 70

58
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,519
days of the growing season for outdoor

59
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,039
production if you're going a photoperiod

60
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,718
dependent you want to be mindful of when

61
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,399
the photoperiod will change to know how

62
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,559
long your plants will stay in veg

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,399
before naturally going into flower

64
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,280
through the natural pattern of

65
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,679
reducing the light or light duration

66
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,598
that your plants will be experiencing

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,800
now utilizing feminized seed so when

68
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,159
seeding a field

69
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
to avoid half the field being

70
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,759
essentially wasted by producing

71
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,439
male plants you typically want to start

72
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,399
with feminized seed is highly

73
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,000
recommended

74
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,920
some growers may choose clones but here

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,479
we're focusing on looking at if you're

76
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,479
starting with

77
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,519
seeds realize though if you're using

78
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,238
feminized seeds

79
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
and if the seed is 99 female or

80
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
feminized

81
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,799
this means one out of 100 plants will be

82
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,959
male on average

83
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,080
so just keep that in mind like and then

84
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,199
it's close enough

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,640
um one out of 100 on average will be

86
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,560
a male so as a reminder 99

87
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,719
is not a hundred percent when there's

88
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,560
100 on average being male this means if

89
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,560
you grow 6 000 plants

90
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,318
and typically field plantings are quite

91
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
large using feminized seed

92
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,479
there will be still 60 male plants in

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,640
the field so scouting in colonies is

94
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,759
still a necessary process because having

95
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,399
60 males

96
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,479
in a planting of 6 000 might be enough

97
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
to produce quite a number of seeds

98
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,840
and reduce your overall cannabinoid

99
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,000
production

100
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,680
we're using mechanized planters so the

101
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,519
size consistency is important to help

102
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
reduce the chance of having skips

103
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,879
or doubles depending on your seating

104
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,719
equipment there might be

105
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,158
computers to help keep track of the

106
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,598
skips or doubles

107
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:24,878
skips is where that seed doesn't get

108
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,719
planted and doubles is where two gets

109
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,399
planted where one should

110
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,840
so this might take some time to kind of

111
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,080
dial in your equipment

112
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,680
however once dialed in this the method

113
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,360
can be very efficient

114
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
but be sure to take into account your

115
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
soil conditions particularly

116
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,878
on the day that you're planting or also

117
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
if you're going from field to field how

118
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,518
conditions may change

119
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,839
the field preparations are a critical

120
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,280
part of the process so consistent

121
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,479
conditions will aid in the formation of

122
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,840
an eaten stand or

123
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,079
referred to as plant emergence if you're

124
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,000
mechanizedly planting the actual seeds

125
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
be sure the field is ready for seeds in

126
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,519
advance of planting

127
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,598
this could be seeds or even looking at

128
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,719
seedlings in some cases the preparations

129
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,639
can be done soon

130
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,400
before planting or even just before

131
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,798
planting to limit your trips in the

132
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,719
field and the cost of production

133
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,400
so now we're going to look at an example

134
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,039
of a field that's been mechanized

135
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
planted

136
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,680
with small recently emerged seedlings so

137
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,079
you can get an idea of how this

138
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,120
actually looks on an actual cannabis

139
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,120
field enjoy

140
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,040
this show is a large scale hemp

141
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,239
production field

142
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,080
with its drip irrigation cannabis plants

143
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,720
spaced about every three feet

144
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,159
drip lines emitters are every one foot

145
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,280
approximately

146
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,840
you can see just the size or scalability

147
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,839
of this type of system
