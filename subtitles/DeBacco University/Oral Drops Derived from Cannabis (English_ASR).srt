00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
on this tobacco university video we're

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,599
going to look at oral drops derived from

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,519
cannabis and provide you a little bit

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,039
more of a detailed and description

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:17,920
so you can have an understanding of just

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:17,920
what these are

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,599
all right let's get into oral drops

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,240
derived from cannabis well first off i

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,480
want to thank

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,679
ct pharma because they provide publicly

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,000
available you know

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,800
local reports and labels uh the

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,039
descriptions

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,399
options and uses here are intended to

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,559
provide an understanding of some

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,160
end products of the cannabis plant ct

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,759
farm does a great job of making that

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,000
publicly available

19
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,519
and has a model for many other companies

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,119
and manufacturers

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,359
so first off description of what oral

22
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,679
drops are well typically

23
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,640
an example here a marijuana extract

24
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,039
blended together

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,520
in a solution with natural flavors and

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,439
medium chain

27
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,399
triglycerides and cts for

28
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,519
a convenient discrete easy to use drop

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,320
form

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,920
now the oral drop options that exist

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,640
there are two different oil drop options

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,359
there's

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280
standard drops of marijuana extract

34
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,920
those natural flavors and those mcts i

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,478
talked about

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,159
there's also nano drops which are amino

37
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,719
marijuana extract blended

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,920
in water soluble based for precision

39
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,280
micro dosing

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,759
so again you have the regular and then

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,519
the nano for that precise micro dosing

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
these drops are available in high cbd

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,840
varieties as well

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,280
high thc varieties and a mix of both thc

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,079
and cbd so again be

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
mindful of what you're seeking and make

47
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,000
sure you're getting that particular

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,000
product

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,840
oil sprays are also available as these

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,519
are lower dose flavored solutions

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,159
they can be sprayed directly into the

52
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,239
mouth now the use of oral drops

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,640
well they're highly convenient way to

54
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,399
ingest marijuana or cannabis in general

55
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,159
as there's no smell no need for any

56
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
combustion they also come in many

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,439
different dosage forms

58
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,200
the drops can also be combined with food

59
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,478
or drink to allow for an easier

60
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
consumption

61
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,519
these drops are highly effective for

62
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,520
patients with respiratory problems as

63
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,280
there is no inhalation requirement

64
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,359
to consume these are some of the

65
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
benefits that they offer

66
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,800
now what those benefits well anything

67
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,318
you're looking at purchasing

68
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
always go back to make sure you can get

69
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,238
a certificate of analysis report

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,759
want to make sure that it's dated and

71
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,200
the lot numbers match up

72
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,199
many people will be looking of course at

73
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,280
the terpenes and cannabinoids and that's

74
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,318
all and good but we want to also be

75
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,919
looking at the

76
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,919
microbial analysis heavy metals

77
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,839
microtoxin pesticides to make sure our

78
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,000
products are passing those

79
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,319
a lot of times the numbers provided here

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,598
will hopefully appear also on the label

81
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,598
and that's great that they have this

82
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,919
label and make it really easy to read

83
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,479
but make sure you're also able to access

84
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,238
the original documents we see here

85
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,479
to encourage that there it's a current

86
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,640
test the lot numbers match up

87
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,399
just so you can be a well-informed

88
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,958
consumer more so just looking at the

89
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
label

90
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,719
making sure you know where to access

91
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,599
that information that supports

92
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,598
the numbers presented there on the label
