1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
okay here and welcome to what is biology

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,120
where we're going to seek to answer that

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,199
question

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,199
here and provide a little background for

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,699
[Music]

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,239
you

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,920
well the obvious question when we're

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,599
looking at biology well by all means

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,400
life and ology means the subject of

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
study

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,439
so therefore biology is the study of

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,359
life

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,759
but that brings in the question what is

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,560
life so when we're looking at what life

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,359
is

16
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,679
life is basically individual components

17
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,920
that

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,439
will result in a behavior you see that

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,600
here with this newly hatched

20
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,199
sea turtle when we're looking at these

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,160
individual components we want to take

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
something

23
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,759
and break it down into those individual

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,640
components take maybe an organism and

25
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,558
break it down

26
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,840
into some of the tissues some of the

27
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,479
potential organs

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,600
or the cells so here we're seeing

29
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,599
someone chucking a

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
corn this kind of gives us the idea of

31
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,039
the layers that can be involved

32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,160
in some of the smaller structures it can

33
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,879
be located within for example the cells

34
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,079
these little corn kernels here you can

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,960
think about them as kind of like

36
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,158
the cells that represent the individual

37
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,679
in cellular organization

38
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,359
all living things are composed of at

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
least one cell so that's a good

40
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,239
way to go about targeting that we also

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,759
have metabolism so all living organisms

42
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,879
use energy consume and use energy

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,280
in addition the all-important

44
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,118
homeostasis

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,879
so here we see some guy in a tightrope

46
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,879
balancing out all living

47
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,118
organisms must maintain stable internal

48
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,118
conditions despite the changing

49
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,959
external conditions that they may be

50
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:40,239
facing so they can stay on

51
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,158
that type of life in addition

52
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,519
we have this kind of blooming and

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,200
growing flower here

54
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,719
and this is important for growth and

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
reproduction all

56
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,399
living organisms must grow and reproduce

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,960
and see the flowers not growing but the

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,478
reproductive structures of the plant

59
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,158
now what those organisms are going to be

60
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,879
passing on is

61
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,640
the process of heredity so all living

62
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,438
organisms possess genetic material

63
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,840
that's based

64
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,599
on dna that's what's passed on to the

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,239
next generation

66
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,840
moving along to the organization of life

67
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
so if we have life we need to have it

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,520
organized and how do we go about

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,959
organizing that

70
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,400
when we're looking at life here we have

71
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,159
a small little ladybug we can look at

72
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,640
the atomic level the molecule level

73
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,400
and we can zoom out to the earth here

74
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,159
and even beyond

75
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,439
and this goes pretty far into kind of

76
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,280
the galaxy based

77
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,560
but you get the idea of how we can start

78
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,878
with something very small

79
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,479
the rest are very large when you walk in

80
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:33,840
the woods well what do you see when you

81
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,679
walk in the west you see kind of all

82
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,239
these things kind of coming together see

83
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,480
how

84
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,759
the water and the trees in the animals

85
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,280
all interact

86
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,959
here we have a single neuron that cannot

87
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,800
perform the tasks of the brain we have

88
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,159
something called an emergent property

89
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
where a higher level organization that

90
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,039
contains novel properties not found in

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,639
the simpler level

92
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,159
here we see neurons working together as

93
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,799
the functional brain that no

94
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,799
single neuron can perform on its own

95
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,920
applying the same concept to these

96
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,519
geese in the field here well we know

97
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,359
what emergent property is

98
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,959
what important property property can

99
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,720
these geese provide

100
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,080
addition they tend to work together for

101
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,158
looking for food

102
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
that's one thing but really if you see

103
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,318
them in the particularly the spring and

104
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,479
the fall

105
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,719
flying efficiency when they form that

106
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,560
nice v

107
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,959
now in addition we have five themes that

108
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,840
unify biology here

109
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,400
and these first one would be evolution

110
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,680
the gene frequencies change in a species

111
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,799
over time this is uh over a long period

112
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,719
of time

113
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,799
in addition another theme that kind of

114
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,959
ties in biology is the flow of energy

115
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,400
here we see plants capturing the sun's

116
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
energy capturing that light energy and

117
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
forming carbohydrates

118
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,318
now we see that flow of energy so those

119
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,560
plants are being fed on by insects ever

120
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,919
seen insect chewing on a leaf

121
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,158
gaining that energy that was once

122
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,000
captured uh by the plant

123
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,079
and then here we see the poor insect

124
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,959
being fed on by another insect so it's

125
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,719
kind of that

126
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,280
circle of life that we kind of go

127
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:02,000
through now in addition

128
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,360
we also have an interaction that will

129
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,639
occur this is interaction between

130
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,080
organisms here the plant and the insect

131
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,919
and we also have structure determines

132
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
function so with the knife and the fork

133
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,119
the structure needs to be well suited to

134
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,560
fit the function

135
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,879
the knife and the fork are a great

136
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,199
example of that and lastly of course we

137
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,358
have

138
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,280
homeostasis living organisms act to

139
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,120
maintain a relatively stable internal

140
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,319
environment despite the changes that

141
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,600
occur around them

142
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,839
so that again they can stay on that

143
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,840
tightrope of life
