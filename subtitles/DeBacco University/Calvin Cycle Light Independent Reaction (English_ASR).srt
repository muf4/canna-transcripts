1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
okay this video lecture is going to go

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,479
over the Calvin cycle which is also

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,240
called the light independent reaction

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,359
because it itself does not require light

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,949
specifically to run it is a cycle so you

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,550
can see that it does have to regenerate

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:19,278
and this is the steps that will go

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,480
through and generate a glucose molecule

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,859
so let's go over and try to understand a

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,560
little bit more about the complexities

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,859
that occur they start off in the basics

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,059
the Calvin cycle it has requirements of

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,660
products from the light dependent

14
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,420
reaction those are ATP and nadph to

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,648
transport those high-energy electrons

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,200
also carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

17
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,149
is required and if you remember going

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,579
back to some of the other videos we used

19
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,410
to did the light dependent reaction now

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,289
well can get specifically the calvin

21
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:51,779
cycle which is again using products from

22
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,939
the light reaction and co2 it will

23
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,910
ultimate generate a sugar or glucose

24
00:00:53,939 --> 00:01:01,500
molecule so the Calvin cycle basics

25
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:03,148
overview of the Calvin cycle pathway and

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,790
you can see this is a cycle that's an

27
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,250
important it's a circle and all of these

28
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,630
are different atoms I highlighted here

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,269
with all the different colors we

30
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:14,250
correspond to black is carbon white is

31
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,259
hydrogen red is oxygen in pink is

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,780
phosphorus so you can see kind of what's

33
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,700
going on here and again this is a cycle

34
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,310
we do have to regenerate the step so we

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,259
can go through the cycle again Calvin

36
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,210
cycle sometimes called the dark reaction

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,000
this is kind of a not the most accurate

38
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:35,849
term to use because it can occur during

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,219
hours of light when the key part is it

40
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:40,349
doesn't require light for it to be able

41
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,450
to perform it does require products of

42
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:45,959
the light reaction but it itself does

43
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,579
not require light it needs those

44
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,449
products to be able to complete the

45
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,859
cycle mainly the ATP and nadph are those

46
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,329
products from the light reaction are

47
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:55,799
coming over and needed for the calvin

48
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:59,639
cycle here and again ultimately

49
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,049
returning a sugar molecule so let's live

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,090
a little more into the details well

51
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,680
where does this occur the calvin cycle

52
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,649
if you're looking at our chloroplast it

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,270
occurs in the stroma is too fluid inside

54
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,729
the chloroplast but outside our

55
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,290
thylakoid membranes the calvin cycle is

56
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:15,179
very efficient it's about

57
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:17,218
percent efficient versus the light

58
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,230
reaction only this is about 20 percent

59
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:23,729
of the photon energy a lot of that's

60
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:26,899
lost to heat other efficiencies this one

61
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:29,009
is very efficient very controlled

62
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,810
so our overview during the Calvin cycle

63
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:33,090
energy in electrons harvested in the

64
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,739
light dependent reactions are used to

65
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,500
produce carbohydrates and is it this

66
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,878
example would be glucose molecule so

67
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,650
we're seeing some of the products being

68
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,108
used we're seeing these three

69
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,980
distinctive steps keep in mind were in

70
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:48,599
the stroma of the chloroplast there are

71
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,000
three stages first one is carbon

72
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:52,590
fixation and this is where carbon

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,568
dioxide from the atmosphere is attached

74
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,479
to an organic molecule called rubp

75
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:59,878
during this stage the second stage

76
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:03,060
myself out of the way second stage over

77
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:06,358
here is the second stage is called

78
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:10,109
reduction here in our reduction phase

79
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:12,750
the energy in electrons in ATP and NADPH

80
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:16,349
are used to produce carbohydrates which

81
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,908
in our case here is glucose molecule the

82
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:20,429
last stage is to reach generation

83
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:22,228
remember this is a cycle the energy from

84
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,709
ATP is used to regenerate the first

85
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:28,709
substrate of the cycle rubp while loving

86
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,000
this cycle to occur again now while it's

87
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,519
important to remember this needs to

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,799
regenerate it's also a very key note

89
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,620
that it takes six complete turns of this

90
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,049
calvin cycle to produce one molecule of

91
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,939
glucose which is six carbons because we

92
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,459
only have one carbon coming in from this

93
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,829
carbon dioxide we need essentially this

94
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,289
to repeat six times to produce one

95
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,739
glucose molecule it's a very important

96
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:54,989
note with the calvin cycle

97
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,969
looking at the three phases remember

98
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,280
this is a cycle very different than the

99
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:01,469
electron transport chain that we talked

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,989
about in the light dependent reaction

101
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:06,658
these three main stages when it cover in

102
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,209
a little bit more detail so starting

103
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:11,969
with the first stage carboxylation we're

104
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,188
fixing our carbon so carbon dioxide and

105
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:17,069
get it here is added to a five carbon

106
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:20,279
sugar called rubp by the Rubisco enzyme

107
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:23,668
a very important enzyme for essentially

108
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:26,839
light taking our carbon dioxide taking

109
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:29,939
their carbon here and adding it

110
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,859
now during this carboxylation the result

111
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,779
is an unstable six carbon molecule so

112
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,598
our TVP could see here's five carbons

113
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:39,598
we're adding a carbon dioxide molecule

114
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:41,399
another carbon creating an unstable six

115
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:44,069
carbon intermediate here's a purpose

116
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:47,128
coenzyme this is going to be easily

117
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:50,908
broken into two more stable three carbon

118
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:52,889
PGA molecules we see that here so two

119
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:55,139
more stable three carbon compounds

120
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,150
called PGA are formed so we have our

121
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,949
five carbon with one carbon from co2

122
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:01,228
binding creating this unstable

123
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:04,080
intimating the six carbon it breaks

124
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:08,389
apart into two three carbon PGA

125
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:12,538
molecules the second stage is reduction

126
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:14,220
so PGH B is reduced requiring two steps

127
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:17,189
and products from the light reaction

128
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,800
here's where our ATP and NADPH from the

129
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:22,529
light reaction are being integrated the

130
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,490
malko called P gal is formed fjell's the

131
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,959
first stable

132
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,930
sugar product you can see it kind of

133
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,718
separating out here this ultimately go

134
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:36,209
on to produce our glucose molecule c6

135
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:38,189
h-12 o-6 now during this reduction ATP

136
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:41,638
and NADPH are used to convert the six

137
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:44,728
molecules of pga into six molecules of a

138
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,668
chemical called phosphoglycerate di di

139
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:49,918
dried P gal is what we're in a call to

140
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:51,750
make it easy this is a reduction

141
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,139
reaction because it involves the gaining

142
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,509
of electrons from NADPH by PGA so just a

143
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,788
refresher here production may recall

144
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:02,610
that reduction is to gain up an electron

145
00:05:59,788 --> 00:06:04,740
by an atom or molecule so because

146
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,538
electrons are negative when we're

147
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,418
gaining this electrons we're becoming

148
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:11,818
reduced in the sense we're reducing that

149
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:16,079
charge so that's what we refer to when I

150
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:18,750
say reduced here the second part of this

151
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:22,620
reduction phase is 6 molecules of both

152
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:25,379
ATP NADPH are used making glucose this

153
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,639
is obviously very energy intensive so a

154
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,129
lot of those products from the light

155
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,750
reaction are used up during this for ATP

156
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,968
the energy is released with the loss of

157
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,649
the terminal phosphate converting to ADP

158
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:40,040
you see here for NADPH both energy and

159
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:43,970
hydrogen atoms is lost convert to nad

160
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:47,000
P+ so these is then going to go back to

161
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,420
the light dependent reaction to then be

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,529
made into ATP and then reattached with

163
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:56,449
the hydrogen ion to make NADPH both of

164
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,619
these molecules return to that light

165
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,930
independent reaction to become

166
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,209
re-energized so they can come back here

167
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,610
and participate in the Calvin cycle and

168
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:08,810
this is the reduction stage of the

169
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:10,879
Calvin cycle the third stage is

170
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,610
regeneration remember this is a cycle

171
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,420
some PL molecules in ATP we generate

172
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,210
rubp

173
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,800
we can get back where we started so that

174
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,899
we can add in our carbon dioxide so we

175
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,790
can repeat the process again because

176
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,579
this is a cycle unlike the electron

177
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:30,500
transport chain produce an end result in

178
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:32,990
product this regeneration has three main

179
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,810
components note not only one of the PBL

180
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,490
molecules leaves the Calvin cycle and is

181
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,170
sent to the cytoplasm to contribute to

182
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,240
the formation of other compounds needed

183
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,220
by the plant feel a little part of it's

184
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,720
broken off here again we're in the

185
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,060
regeneration phase so we're talking

186
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,310
we're right in this area here in since

187
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,319
it's also going to be requiring ATP and

188
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,230
the whole point of this is to regenerate

189
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:58,670
our rubp molecule to bind another carbon

190
00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:01,220
dioxide part two of this since Big Al is

191
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,080
exported from the chloroplast has three

192
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,870
carbon atoms it takes three turns in the

193
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:09,079
calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to

194
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:12,019
export one p gal but each turn makes two

195
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:14,659
Pig Al's us it makes six you gals in

196
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:16,759
total so because this is a cycle so it

197
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,710
gets a little confusing this has to go

198
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:23,300
around multiple times to generate some

199
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:25,699
of these complex end products the last

200
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,590
phase of the regeneration one is export

201
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:29,779
while the remaining 5 PL Mantle's

202
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:33,168
remain in the cycle are used to run

203
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:35,120
maybe generate rubp this enables the

204
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:36,769
system to prepare for more carbon

205
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,320
dioxide to be fixed and with to

206
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:40,429
regenerate and remind our incoming next

207
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,860
carbon dioxide molecule

208
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:46,129
three more molecules of ATP are used in

209
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,779
these regeneration actions so the

210
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:50,210
regeneration most of the ATP is used

211
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,519
here between stages one and two the

212
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,600
carbon fixation and reduction but

213
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,439
there's also some to reach

214
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,779
regulating the Calvin cycle will

215
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,330
products of the light reaction can help

216
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:04,399
regulate this the photosynthetic rate if

217
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:07,220
the light dependent reaction is going

218
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,709
very slowly there's not be as much ATP

219
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,139
and nadph generated that can slow down

220
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,600
the Calvin cycle even though the Calvin

221
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,370
cycle does not require light to function

222
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,409
it does require products of the light

223
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,179
reaction also the amount of carbon

224
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:24,289
dioxide present can help regulate this

225
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:27,049
phase also the end here a couple of you

226
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:28,789
videos if you want to review these are

227
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:30,769
independent links that you're welcome to

228
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:32,779
take a look at and hopefully this tries

229
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:35,029
to make it a little bit easier to

230
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:38,740
understand this complex process called

231
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,740
the Calvin cycle to generate glucose
