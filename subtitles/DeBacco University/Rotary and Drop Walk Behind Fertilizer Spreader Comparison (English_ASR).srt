00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,979
welcome to this tobacco University video

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,960
where I'm going to go over a rotary and

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,179
drop walk behind the fertilizer spreader

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,339
comparison to determine which one of the

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,760
two is the best fit for your given

6
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,759
situation

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,420
[Music]

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,919
all right when you're looking at these

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,720
options here are some questions you

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,519
should be asking is the ground

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,559
established or is it rough has it been

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:29,759
recently in tilled and roughed up well

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,439
that's going to be best for a rotary

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,539
spreader is it more of a turf grass

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,399
application More Level drop spreader

16
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,019
might be the favorite pick there what

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,480
type of fertilizer are you looking to

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,920
apply is it going to be pelletized that

19
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,019
would be best for a rotary sprayer

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,579
because they throw it further or a

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,100
powder that's be better for a drop

22
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,420
spreader but the questions are just go a

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,820
little bit beyond this and I want you to

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,559
make an informed decision so when we're

25
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,420
looking at a true rotary spreader here

26
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,759
it throws fertilizer well beyond the

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,980
width of the spreader it can cover a

28
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,479
large area very quickly it's best for

29
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,859
Products that come in pelletized form

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,319
because you're able to kind of throw

31
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,478
that on that distance it allows for that

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,699
nice even distribution

33
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,500
now we're looking at a drop spreader as

34
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,780
the name implies the product basically

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,819
drops vertically there's an agitator

36
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,379
that turns when the wheels move to keep

37
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,419
an even distribution of the material

38
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,459
it's best for small areas or when

39
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,560
applying fine or lightweight products

40
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,959
overlapping is recommended to ensure

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,759
even coverage so you kind of go one way

42
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,679
and kind of go the other way it allows

43
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,140
to ensure you're getting a consistent

44
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,420
coverage over the entire area you intend

45
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,680
to get that product applied

46
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,820
now we're looking at our rotary

47
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,380
dispatchers they said they throw the

48
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,379
fertilizer well the question is well how

49
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:43,199
far using a constant sized and weighted

50
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,060
pelton's product you can go over some

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,820
trays and collect the material after a

52
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,978
few passes as we can see here this will

53
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,078
let you know what the effective swath is

54
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:53,399
for your spreader so you collect all the

55
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,298
trays and gives you an idea of course

56
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,859
it's going to always be a little bit

57
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,780
more closer to the center point where

58
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,519
the spreader goes over gives you an idea

59
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,439
of that effective spot how far you

60
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,019
actually covering and this will

61
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,279
determine your overlap area as well so

62
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,379
you know it takes can be a little bit of

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,780
a pain to do initially just go over same

64
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,519
area collect some data and really makes

65
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,340
it much easier for you to make sure

66
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,360
you're not wasting your time and wasting

67
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,180
product when you're going through and

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,980
applying it for full calibration of

69
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,659
spreaders in general Penn State

70
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:24,479
Extension has a full set of instructions

71
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:27,060
so there's a link here direct link you

72
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,500
can read more about that what it comes

73
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,560
down to is the amount of product you

74
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,598
apply over an area for most homeowners

75
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,520
you can read the suggestions on your

76
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,060
spreader calculate your observed swath

77
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,920
and then and favor on the low side and

78
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,360
make a pass of known amount of

79
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,559
fertilizer so once you know the amount

80
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,420
of fertilizer you added and you know the

81
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,719
area covered then you can check to see

82
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,039
how much area was covered per pound

83
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:51,840
fertilizer and to factor this up for

84
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,699
your chosen area to ensure you're

85
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,259
applying the correct amount this will

86
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,119
help ensure you do not go over applying

87
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,399
fertilizer for a given area and help

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,759
keep your costs low and your chance for

89
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,739
environmental contamination also low

90
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,479
if you're calibrating a drop spreader

91
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,860
since the swath is known since it

92
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,899
depends on the width of your drop

93
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,760
spreader the same concept for

94
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,980
determining fertilizer applied to areas

95
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,079
a rotary spreader can be followed the

96
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:17,878
key again is to favor on the low side as

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,440
it's easier to make another pass or

98
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:21,598
increase the drop rate and there's ways

99
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,098
you can dial in those spreaders keep in

100
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,439
mind that you should be making two

101
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,419
passes to ensure even and complete

102
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,759
coverage now it's great to kind of take

103
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,219
some of the confusion out of this is

104
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,199
that a lot of times fertilizer bags will

105
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,878
have a starting point you'll look at

106
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,098
your spreader model and they'll look at

107
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,018
the suggested settings to apply a set

108
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:42,780
amount of fertilizer so again this can

109
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,700
act as a great kind of way to start and

110
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,140
then go through do a little area and

111
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,639
then you can go through and determine

112
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,979
whether it's matching what you think

113
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,839
again the key part here is also keep a

114
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,859
you know consistent walking pace because

115
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,560
that will affect your amount of

116
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,720
fertilizer added as well and here are

117
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,580
some common fertilizer model Brands

118
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,560
there and a lot of times fertilizer

119
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,260
companies and spreaders try to match up

120
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,900
what they have there so you can at least

121
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,759
provide a substitute there that may be

122
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,860
close to what you have to again create

123
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,019
that good starting point

124
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,060
now that suggested pattern I suggest a

125
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,918
cross grid pattern reduces the chance of

126
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,540
skipping over an area so you kind of go

127
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,759
from here we'll say from left to right

128
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,139
and get to the end and kind of go up and

129
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,639
down so you kind of go like an East West

130
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,259
and then the north-south kind of

131
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,478
spreading pattern there and that helps

132
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,979
ensure even coverage

133
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,319
now this is an example of poor

134
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,399
applications particularly with when

135
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,139
you're applying nitrogen-based

136
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,060
fertilizers you can see an area that you

137
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,819
might miss and here we can definitely

138
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,560
see the overlap was not nearly what

139
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,599
should have been this causes the

140
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
striping to occur in these particular

141
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,840
Lawns here

142
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,060
now if you can only get one just

143
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,739
speaking in general uh rotary spreader

144
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,360
is probably the more Universal spreader

145
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,340
it can spread powdered forms of

146
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,639
fertilizer but it will be messy and it

147
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:58,439
will clog easily but it can be done this

148
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,540
is designed this rotary spreader

149
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,160
typically for larger applications and

150
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,960
this is for a reason because of the type

151
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,000
of material they're applying the

152
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,039
coverage area and the efficiency overall

153
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,600
okay these are some larger ones mounted

154
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,220
on the three-point hitches of tractors

155
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
but the same could be applied to your

156
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,160
walk behind

157
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,840
now if you want kind of a little field

158
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,199
comparison I shot some video here

159
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,359
comparing a looking at two Scott brand

160
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,220
fertilizer spreaders both a rotary

161
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,419
spreader and a drop spreader so if you

162
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,820
want to see some of the specifics of

163
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:29,159
them hopefully you enjoy the out in the

164
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,019
field video segment now what we have

165
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,000
here are two spreaders they each have

166
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,799
vastly different purposes so you don't

167
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,720
want to use them for the same thing okay

168
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,240
this first fertilizer spreader here is

169
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,940
called a rotary spreader and this has a

170
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,860
name implies put the fertilizer or lime

171
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,418
potentially in the hopper here it's

172
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,780
going to go through and work its way

173
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:51,538
down and get spun out at the bottom here

174
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:53,339
and spread that way it's a rotary motion

175
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:54,899
that goes through and does and the

176
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:56,459
advantage is the wheels kind of go

177
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:58,620
through and they drive it and you can

178
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:01,019
see that it rotates as you will go

179
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,478
through and walk the field great for

180
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:06,180
large pelletilized fertilizers or in

181
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,758
this case lime is being added great to

182
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,978
be able to dial it in and kind of get an

183
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,080
even spread throughout your field

184
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:15,240
this fertilizer spread is called a drop

185
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:18,060
spreader and just as the name implies

186
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,918
you put the fertilizer here and it drops

187
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,560
through as you go through and push it

188
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,478
it'll rotate those causing it to

189
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,639
basically drop it won't really spread or

190
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,879
throw a lot and that's why you see

191
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,918
established here there's some arrows to

192
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,019
try to indicate where you should be

193
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,639
aligning to as you go through and drop

194
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,318
spread it because this will offer you

195
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,319
the kind of the advantage to kind of go

196
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,939
through and create for a small area of

197
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,520
different types of fertilizer maybe more

198
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:46,620
powdered based can drop through here it

199
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,740
will only go in between those two wheels

200
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,800
in comparison to the other fertilizer

201
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,720
these rotary spreader that'll actually

202
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,000
throw the fertilizers we kind of see in

203
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,220
the image here it is that we'll kind of

204
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,199
throw it and get a little bit larger of

205
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,060
a spread area compared to Just In

206
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,978
Between the Wheels so again while these

207
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,600
are two spreaders they each have a

208
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:09,079
different purpose and should be used for

209
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,080
that purpose

210
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,780
with the rotary spreader here you have a

211
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,418
handle that you would grab and when you

212
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,519
pull on that handle it will open up that

213
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:22,740
and allow that fertilizer to fall

214
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,779
through the little hole here as you go

215
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,000
through and walk it'll rotate that right

216
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,399
through and how you control how much

217
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,038
that opens is based on the dial or the

218
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,598
spreader setting here so let's determine

219
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,699
whether it opens only this much when you

220
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:39,538
pull it this much it'll essentially

221
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:42,360
determine how much fertilizer you add as

222
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:44,098
you walk down the field

223
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,720
the drop spreader Works in a very

224
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:47,339
similar way where you have the same

225
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,960
thing here that you would pull and that

226
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,959
would open the area there and as you

227
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,939
walk and we'll rotate those however

228
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,680
what's unique here is that you also have

229
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,598
a setting as well that you can go

230
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,060
through and adjust

231
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,279
so on the drop spreader we have a

232
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,199
setting here you simply dial that in

233
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,538
here it's set to five and that will

234
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,759
change the amount that the drop opens

235
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:10,620
indicating how much fertilizer you add

236
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,419
as you go through and walk down the

237
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,639
field

238
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:17,159
overall between the two spreaders that

239
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,800
you see here the rotary spreader is a

240
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,620
little bit more Universal allows for

241
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,300
spreading of in general low for a larger

242
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,519
area a little bit easier to spread

243
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,620
material the drop spreader a little bit

244
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,740
more specific and typically used more in

245
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,879
a turf grass or lawn setting so if

246
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,080
you're only going to buy one the rotary

247
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,879
spreader is probably the one you should

248
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,339
look at but as I said they each have

249
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,139
their own purpose and make sure you get

250
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:45,680
the piece of equipment that matches the

251
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:45,679
purpose for for your intended job
