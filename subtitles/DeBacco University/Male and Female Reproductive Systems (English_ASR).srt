1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,209
okay here we're gonna look at a brief

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,019
overview of the male and female

3
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:08,699
reproductive systems so starting with

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,439
male and female looking at how is sex

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,589
determined well in mammal sex is

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:15,660
determined early embryonic development

7
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:18,689
early on embryo gonads are indifferent

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,820
either male or female the presence of a

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,390
y-chromosome will convert the gonads

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,800
into testes defining a male we see that

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,618
here where the female gametes are two

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,679
x's males are an x and a y the Y is

13
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,308
important for converting the gonads into

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:34,289
testes

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,328
even though there's not many genes

16
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,128
encoded on the Y chromosome that's been

17
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,280
very important and that's a defining

18
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,399
characteristic of males we see the size

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,329
comparison of the Y to the X chromosome

20
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,549
however in some animals for example

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,250
reptiles the sex of the offspring is

22
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,468
temperature dependent we see in these

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,929
graphs here and also this next

24
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,780
representation this example here if the

25
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:00,329
temperature is cool or very warm the

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,730
offspring here will be dominantly male

27
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,588
if the temperature happens to be in the

28
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,929
middle of these two ranges in this case

29
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:09,298
these eggs will be predominantly female

30
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,799
in nature that's very important all ears

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,670
you'll have an entire nest be either

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,009
male or female depending on the organism

33
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,379
the temperature ranges it can influence

34
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:23,489
the percentage of males that will hatch

35
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:25,048
from these eggs now looking at look at

36
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:26,969
some of the specifics so if you're

37
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,460
unfamiliar with meiosis you might want

38
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,599
to review this slide here keep in mind

39
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,868
that we're starting with a diploid cell

40
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:36,658
and we're resulting in haploid cells in

41
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:38,759
the end and there's a minus 1 than

42
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,079
meiosis 2 that does occur so you may

43
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,319
want to review this slide just to

44
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,129
refresh yourself with this process

45
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,589
looking down at the male reproductive

46
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,149
organs the testes produce sperm and

47
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,609
testosterone and they're enclosed in a

48
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,379
hanging sac called a scrotum the key

49
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:54,269
part here is reason why they're located

50
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,209
externally in the body is firming a

51
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:59,849
cooler temperature to develop so we see

52
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:03,030
here four males trying to conceive males

53
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:05,099
are typically suggested not to wear

54
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,750
tight underwear or skinny jeans

55
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:10,859
there's instead suggested to favor boxer

56
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,199
shorts and loose pants

57
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,370
what this allows to have happen

58
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,199
the scrotum in the testes they hang

59
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,629
outside of the body and we made have a

60
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,969
cooler temperature this cooler than body

61
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:23,039
temperature will increase the survival

62
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:26,128
of the sperm and therefore increase the

63
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,750
chance of conception the sperm and

64
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:29,848
Genesis the formation of the sperm

65
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,560
actually in the testes keep in mind we

66
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:33,060
are starting with this diploid cell and

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,360
ultimately we're going to be producing

68
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,890
four viable sperm cells this gives you a

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,049
little bit of the details of what the

70
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:41,939
sperms will look like but I'm not going

71
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,620
to focus on this too much in this

72
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,709
lecture series this is only a brief

73
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,840
overview that the female reproductive

74
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:51,598
organs I will get the ovaries being the

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,870
primary female reproductive organ this

76
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,429
is a female gamete or the OVA they

77
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,250
secrete these female sex hormones

78
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,620
estrogen and progesterone while we could

79
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,110
see here the ovary and the fallopian

80
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,269
tubes in the uterus this is important

81
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,299
for fertilization if you ever heard

82
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,060
determing caviar this is basically fish

83
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,829
eggs this collection from sturgeon which

84
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,348
is a very rare and delicacy and they're

85
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:20,510
expensive this is just a collection of

86
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:22,919
those female eggs that are unfertilized

87
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:24,659
now looking at the events to generate

88
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,659
these eggs what's interesting is that

89
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:31,439
before birth female eggs will be

90
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,879
arrested or pause in prophase 1 be

91
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,979
confused what prophase 1 is you might

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,859
want to go back and review the mitosis

93
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:41,399
review slide sing during osa arrest in

94
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:43,799
metaphase 2 and is ovulated if they're

95
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,200
penetrated by a sperm secondary oocytes

96
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,420
completes meiosis 2 yielding in one

97
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,328
large ovum which is the functional yeah

98
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,949
me an attorney second polar body so is

99
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,010
this sequence of events that occurs

100
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:58,858
before the sperm may enter the egg after

101
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:01,590
the sperm may enter the egg now we're

102
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,959
having this kind of primary oocyte in

103
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,479
this breakdown these polar bodies this

104
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,810
is very different in paracin to the

105
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,969
formation of the sperm as we saw earlier

106
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,949
and providing a direct example of the -

107
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:16,348
oh genesis we're starting with that

108
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:19,738
diploid cell ultimately producing only

109
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:22,490
one viable ovum these small polar bodies

110
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:25,949
while haploid are not really functional

111
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,689
primary spermatocyte we're having that

112
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:31,349
2n diploid perdu

113
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:33,629
four viable sperm in the end so it's

114
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,540
important that for every diploid cell

115
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,250
producing this four viable sperm versus

116
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,330
in oogenesis were only producing one

117
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,639
viable over now the ovary and the

118
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,379
formation of an ovum at birth female

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,500
ovaries contain all the osage you'll

120
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,600
ever produce so at birth every female

121
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,279
has all the eggs they'll ever have it's

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,530
about two million other sites and

123
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,859
they're arrested or paused in prophase

124
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:59,759
one of the first mitotic division mature

125
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,160
egg cells are called

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,409
OVA which single ovum and the cycles

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,650
repeat about every 28 days all one is

128
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,560
released but a birth which is kind of

129
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:12,779
hard to think about but two million

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,370
other sites are present in every female

131
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,219
and those are the eggs you'll have with

132
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,290
her for her entire life

133
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,110
now the fertilization process occurs

134
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:25,470
when the egg is in the fallopian tubes

135
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:28,199
here and a sperm will meet that egg and

136
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,050
only one sperm is allowed to penetrate

137
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,659
the o'the site the fertilized egg will

138
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,490
now be called a zygote it's transferred

139
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,140
ultimate to the uterus and this

140
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,790
transportation process may take about

141
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,370
five to seven days to reach the uterus

142
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,860
it'll attach to the wall and this is

143
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,259
where the zygote will then form into the

144
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,419
fetus and develop into a baby it's

145
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,209
important to remember that fertilization

146
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:53,729
can only occur in the fallopian tubes by

147
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:55,469
time it reaches the uterus at this point

148
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,780
it'll attach to the wall if it is

149
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,970
fertilized and the baby will develop

150
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,949
from there hopefully this gives you that

151
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,560
brief overview and a little bit more of

152
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:07,550
the detail of male and female

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,550
reproductive systems
