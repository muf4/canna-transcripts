1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,639
this debacco University video I'm going

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:07,240
to go over optimizing magnesium

3
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:07,240
fertilizer rates for cannabis

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,399
[Music]

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,278
production okay our goal is not to over

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,039
fertilize plants so how do we go about

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,000
optimizing and avoiding plants that look

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,080
like this here we're going to look at

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,079
magnesium uh in particular and its

10
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,879
importance so here's the research study

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,358
and the citation that goes along with it

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,559
if you want to look at the original

13
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,960
study in more detail

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,759
so first off what's the importance of

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,960
magnesium why should we be concerned

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,839
about magnesium it is an essential

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,039
macronutrient for plant growth and

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,000
Metabolism which may be disrupted under

19
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,039
magnesium deficiency or toxicity

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,679
conditions it involves the in

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,679
photosynthesis by activation of the

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:54,198
ribos biphosphate carbas oxye enzyme

23
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,920
typically referred to as rabisco and as

24
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,238
a central component of the chlorophyll

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,600
molecule and we can see that located

26
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,439
right here as magnesium molecule being

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,478
right in the center of that chlorophyll

28
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,719
molecule and then here's rabisco

29
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,719
important for the photosynthetic process

30
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,560
it's also important for cell division

31
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,400
involved in the activation of several

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,200
enzymes acts as a phosphorous carrier in

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,280
plants is essential for plant

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,040
respiration and essential component

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
again of the chlorophyll MC as we saw

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,240
here um so many many roles that

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,118
magnesium plays now what are this

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,199
deficiency symptoms well inter vinal

39
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:30,799
yelling of the leaves typically first

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,600
seen in the lower leaves or the older

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,759
leaves um on the plant of course this is

42
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,239
an extreme case but did that interanal

43
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,239
meaning if you're looking at the veins

44
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,560
of the um plant it's going to be in

45
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,560
between those veins inter vinal is what

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,840
that's referring to um and typically

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,439
it's first seen on those lower or older

48
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,799
portion leaves

49
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,359
first now looking at the study here 30

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,118
days after the initiation of the

51
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:57,640
magnesium treatment visual appearance of

52
00:01:52,118 --> 00:02:00,118
the plants under 2 20 3540 and 140 U mg

53
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,239
per liter of magnesium Supply the very

54
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,159
top here we're looking at the plants

55
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,158
themselves from kind of a zoomed out

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,920
macroscop look and again magnesium

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,879
concentration here so the lowest here is

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,759
on the left and the highest is on the

59
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:14,439
right then we get to the um next row

60
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,799
here we're looking at the uh youngest

61
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,639
mature leaves in the second row and then

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,560
the older leaves uh from the bottom of

63
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,518
the plant again this be your third row

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
and we could see definitely those older

65
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,560
leaves definitely showing it here in

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,400
that very low treatment and we've got

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,400
the roots also in comparison there which

68
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,239
visually may not have very Stark

69
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,000
differences uh but again we're looking

70
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:39,039
at the whole plant here so what's the

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
effect of U magnesium Supply there well

72
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,639
the effect of magnesium Supply on macro

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,560
and micronutrient concentrations in the

74
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,518
leaves stems and roots of medicinal

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,878
cannabis plants so leaves are

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,480
represented by the green circles stems

77
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:55,158
by the uh red triangle and Roots by the

78
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,840
dark blue squares and we can see again

79
00:02:55,158 --> 00:03:01,158
here's our nitrogen here is our

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,439
potassium here is our um calcium here's

81
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:07,959
our zinc iron manganese magnesium as

82
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,919
well and then phosphorus so this is a

83
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,280
presented data and we can see as those

84
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,719
magnesium concentrations change some

85
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,519
things remain relatively stable uh and

86
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,439
other things have uh changes not always

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,280
greater so we could see that definitely

88
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,840
at the low concentration of magnesium uh

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,199
to them there's this immediately

90
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,158
leveling off here of nitrogen in the uh

91
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,479
leaves uh the stems and also um The

92
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,878
Roots so leaves here Roots here and then

93
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,318
stems here others you know correlate

94
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:41,438
differently here for potassium we see an

95
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:44,518
overall increase in our root amount of

96
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:46,959
magnesium but a decrease in the leaves

97
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,438
and also the stems so just kind of an

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,000
interesting correlation or a look at and

99
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:53,000
as again we increase magnesium we would

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,158
expect magesium concentration overall to

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,360
increase in all parts of the plant so

102
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:58,318
what does this kind of mean what's this

103
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,519
kind of uh relate to and why is this you

104
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:00,639
know why should we be concerned about

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,480
this

106
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,559
well because magnesium interacts

107
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,598
particularly with calcium as well as

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
potassium so increased magnesium Supply

109
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,438
impaired the uptake of calcium potassium

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,760
in their root to shoot translocation

111
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,078
demonstrating a compe a competitive

112
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,439
cation inhibition what does that mean

113
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,199
well calcium and potassium are both

114
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,918
positive or cat I as well as magnesium

115
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,000
we've got a lot of magnesiums here

116
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,519
globbing onto the negative soil

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
particles you're going to impair the

118
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,478
root hair's ability to absorb those

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,120
other cat ions s it's going to kind of

120
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,199
block or suppress the ability for plants

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,800
to absorb the very important potassium

122
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
as well as calcium ions so having two

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,400
high of one nutrient can block or

124
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,680
suppress others now what's the possible

125
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,478
effects on that soil Aggregates as well

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,319
excessive fertilizer applications may

127
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,879
have more impact than just nutrient

128
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,399
levels possible effects of calcium and

129
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:54,279
magnesium cats and soil aggregation more

130
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,159
calcium attracts clay particles together

131
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:59,799
to form Aggregates or form uh basically

132
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,000
a well- defined structure there versus

133
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,038
more magnesium repels clay particles and

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,199
break aparts breaks apart those

135
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,918
Aggregates the Aggregates are important

136
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,840
because we do want them to have that

137
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,959
cation exchange capacity and interact

138
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,599
with the roots and if we over add our

139
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,560
magnesium we're causing repelling or

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,560
breaking apart of that basic soil

141
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,879
structure now min max um levels here

142
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,560
it's definitely a minimum level

143
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,600
magnesium deficiency symptoms develop

144
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,000
first on those older leaves it was shown

145
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,039
at 2 Mig per liter and progressed

146
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,478
towards um young mature leaves

147
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,000
demonstrating the ability for magnesium

148
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,560
in plant storage and also remobilization

149
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,519
it can move magnesium toxicity symptoms

150
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,360
appear in older Leaves From the Bottom

151
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:43,359
of the plants under 140 milligram per

152
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,479
liter of magnesium so what's the general

153
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,560
uh target range and what could we add to

154
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,038
correct this if we're below Optimum well

155
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,800
the findings suggest that 35 to 70 U

156
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:53,800
milligrams per liter of magnesium is the

157
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,520
optimum concentration again it is a

158
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,800
range uh for canis plant development and

159
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,719
function at the vegetative growth phase

160
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,160
this can be converted here to parts per

161
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,039
million or ounces per gallon and this is

162
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,080
again looking at pure mag magnesium

163
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,560
we'll talk about some fertilizers I just

164
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:10,478
want to draw your attention to he that

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,478
below Optimum again is the red there's

166
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,199
an Optimum range and then there's above

167
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,318
Optimum so if you get a soil test back

168
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,919
you want to be in that Optimum range now

169
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
and this shows the above Optimum kind of

170
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,318
remaining level but a lot of times if

171
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,439
you get too excessive you can actually

172
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,560
have a decrease in yield toxicity

173
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,560
symptoms can lead to a decrease in yield

174
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,800
so staying in that Optimum range is

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,319
really the target of any grower so what

176
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,840
are if we're low in magnesium what could

177
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,240
we add well dolomitic lime if we need to

178
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,000
adjust our soils or substrates uh pH

179
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,319
would be a great addition that contains

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,879
about 99.5% uh magnesium Epsom salts if

181
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,439
we need to have something water soluble

182
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,759
to water in uh it contains a little bit

183
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,719
more magnesium slightly

184
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,879
99.87% and for something continuous

185
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,560
feeding wise and typically plants need

186
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:01,000
calcium anyways a Cal Mag fertilizer

187
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,959
here which may only have 1 2% magnesium

188
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,598
but continually being fed can slowly

189
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,318
build those levels up or really maintain

190
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,120
those levels within that Optimum range

191
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,680
again don't want to get too excessive

192
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,840
because then negative things can happen

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,280
don't want to be under we don't have

194
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,439
reduction in yield want to stay right in

195
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,598
that Optimum range and hopefully this

196
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:23,800
study gives you that Target of what that

197
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,800
Optimum range actually is
