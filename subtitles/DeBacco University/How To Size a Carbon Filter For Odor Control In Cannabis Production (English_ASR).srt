1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
okay so you've selected a carbon filter

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,278
to reduce

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,798
your odor in your cannabis production

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,120
you go to buy a carbon filter and you

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,880
realize there's a lot of different sizes

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,638
well here at tobacco university i'm

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,160
going to go over how to size a carbon

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,919
filter for odor control

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,920
in cannabis production

10
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:25,199
[Music]

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,118
all right let's ensure that you buy the

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,640
right carbon filter the first time

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,399
so let's go over some things you need to

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,280
take into consideration for

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,519
sizing it properly so first off the root

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,679
measurements and calculations

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,840
so calculate your room volume not just

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,600
your growing area so what does that mean

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,280
you want to take into account the full

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,320
size of the room and not only where the

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,840
plants are

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,840
you don't want to simply be looking at

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,320
the you know length and width of the

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,480
room

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,759
you also want to take into account the

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,959
height to get the full

27
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:58,558
volume of the area so an example

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,120
if you had a room that was 20 feet long

29
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,079
a 10 foot wide and then 8 foot ceilings

30
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,959
you would have 1

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,280
600 cubic feet of volume that's what you

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,839
want to take into consideration

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,799
now cfm is cubic feet per minute so a

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,520
lot of times you'll see

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,799
on filters they'll list things in cubic

36
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,319
feet per minute

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,000
at the very least you should exchange

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,758
your air about every three minutes

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,319
however typically you should aim for

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,719
really exchanging air in your grow rooms

41
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,879
volume at least once a minute you want

42
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,319
to continuing with this example that we

43
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,879
did in the previous slide

44
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,438
if you if you had that 1 600 cubic foot

45
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,118
room

46
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,319
the minimum would be every 3 minutes

47
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:34,719
which means you would need a filter that

48
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,478
would

49
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,560
have a rating of at least 533.3

50
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,078
cfm however you really want to be

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,200
targeting something at 1

52
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,879
600 cfm so like why don't you go larger

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,359
it will simply that it does become

54
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,158
more of an expense so this is why people

55
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,640
try to sometimes

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,320
reduce the size of the carbon filter but

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,079
this can restrict airflow

58
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,959
and this could cause other issues with

59
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,959
ventilation so again shooting for that

60
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,000
once every minute to three minutes it

61
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,078
should be your target

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,759
favoring closer to that minute if

63
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,759
possible

64
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,038
and however while we did those nice math

65
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,318
and it seemed nice and easy and

66
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,359
hopefully you're continuing to watch

67
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,039
this video

68
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,239
there's other factors to take into

69
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,759
consideration it's not as simple as

70
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,280
doing a quick math equation

71
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,199
you also want to take into consideration

72
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,640
your lighting if you're using high

73
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,639
intensity discharge lighting

74
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,958
will require more ventilation and also

75
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,279
provide grow room cooling

76
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,360
also the filter types how restrictive is

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
the actual filter you're using

78
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,800
you know some of the more expensive ones

79
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,319
have that finer carbon

80
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,160
particulate and they're going to flow a

81
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,839
little bit better also what is the

82
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,519
ambient temperature warmer temperatures

83
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,120
will typically increase the airflow

84
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,719
required to aid in cooling

85
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,480
so you should be closer definitely to

86
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,159
that one exchange

87
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,878
of the grow room's volume per minute

88
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,959
and we also need to consider the cfm

89
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,199
loss meaning everything is not perfect

90
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,560
uh how much cfm is lost through a 25

91
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,719
foot section of ducting

92
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
well approximately three percent if it's

93
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,680
a straight hard

94
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,439
cast uh to seven percent if it's

95
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,439
flexible ducting

96
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,919
and also one to four percent additional

97
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,759
loss for every 90 degree bend

98
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,000
this is why ideally if you had that

99
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,840
straight hard kind of casting

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,120
that is the most efficient way to move

101
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
air through a

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
ducting if you have this flexible duct

103
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,878
tape which makes it great for

104
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,479
installation

105
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,318
you do lose about one to four percent

106
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,959
and you want to minimize as we can see

107
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,158
not shown here minimize the amount of 90

108
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,759
degree bends you want to have everything

109
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,079
to be as straight as possible

110
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,878
so you have as efficient movement of air

111
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,400
as possible

112
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,479
to allow you to use the quote the

113
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,879
smallest filter so you can try to reduce

114
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,280
the

115
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,120
cost as much as possible and also

116
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,799
maximize the efficiency

117
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
of your ventilation system
