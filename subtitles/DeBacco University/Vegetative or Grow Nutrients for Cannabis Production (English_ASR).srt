1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,519
everyone to learn more about the

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,240
vegetative or grow nutrients you see

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,720
at grow shops at this tobacco university

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,638
video

5
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:17,919
we'll provide some information just on

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:19,519
that topic

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,520
we see some wonderful plants here in the

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,960
vegetative stage so vegetative or grow

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,160
nutrients for chemist production how do

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,880
we utilize those

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
let's get into that now so veg or grow

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,799
nutrients just

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,399
in general these are intended to be used

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,000
during the vegetative stage again as the

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,920
name implies

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,920
for plant production but they can also

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,480
really be used at any stage of plant

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,000
growth

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,238
however they tend to have higher levels

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,200
of nitrogen to support plant biomass

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,199
growth such as the leaves in the stems

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,960
and lower levels of phosphorus and

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,399
potassium that are needed in greater

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,198
amounts during the flowering and later

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,439
stages

26
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,479
however that does not mean once you flip

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,878
your plants into

28
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,558
flowering stage you'd simply stop using

29
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:59,439
these nutrients you can continue to

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,519
utilize them

31
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,119
because they still can be effective even

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,840
later in stages of growth

33
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,560
if used properly so how long should i

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,719
veg for

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
best yield well this may depend on the

36
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,118
strain you're growing and the size of

37
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,879
your growing area

38
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,040
however in general most growers are kind

39
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,640
of vegging for four to six weeks

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,640
typically plants will stretch at least

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,200
fifty percent after the flip which in

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,599
that chance

43
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,799
transition from the vegetative stage to

44
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,118
the flowering stage

45
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,799
photo period so plan accordingly for

46
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,400
your growth space particularly if you're

47
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,920
ceiling height limited

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,840
for outdoor growers plants will start

49
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
flowering in early july

50
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,359
if you're in the northern hemisphere for

51
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,359
growing if you're growing an autoflower

52
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,840
remember your plant will flower based on

53
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,078
days

54
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,759
old so that may influence when you

55
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,039
fertilize it and what you fertilize it

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,040
with

57
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,399
so veg nutrients can be used anytime and

58
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,680
this is something a lot of growers don't

59
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,519
think realize that

60
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,040
many times growers reduce the frequency

61
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,239
or concentration of vegetable

62
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
fertilizers

63
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,158
right after flower but typically these

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,478
fertilizers can serve as a great base of

65
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,320
feed

66
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,478
feeding program for the entire grow

67
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,599
cycle some veg grow fertilizers do

68
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,519
contain

69
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,438
levels of phosphorus and potassium

70
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,399
anyway so depending on the ratio the

71
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,919
plant needs

72
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,000
many times these fertilizers are a

73
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,239
staple in the growing operation

74
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,598
so don't think just because it says veg

75
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,480
and your plants are in flower

76
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,639
there's going to be some sort of

77
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,280
negative interaction there these

78
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,079
veg nutrients tend to be a more stable

79
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
blend

80
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,760
do offer some nitrogen you may have to

81
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,920
adjust the amounts and concentration and

82
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:28,079
amount of times you use them but again

83
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,719
they can be utilized at the early stages

84
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,879
of growth

85
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,878
as well as the flowering phase as well

86
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:33,518
and they can help you produce a very

87
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,000
quality

88
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,000
yield
