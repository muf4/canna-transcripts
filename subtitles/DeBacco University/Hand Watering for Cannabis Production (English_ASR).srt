00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,879
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,970
going to be looking at hand watering for

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,140
cannabis production

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:09,140
[Music]

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,359
so while this might be a little bit of a

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,960
labor intensive task

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,840
going over some of the specifics here

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,600
for hand watering in this presentation

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,960
so first off the advantages it can be

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,960
plant specific

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,039
hand warning allows for individual

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,960
plants to get watered individually

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,960
this also requires someone to visit each

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,719
plant each day which can be important

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,558
for scouting for disease or

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,920
insects instead of just kind of turning

17
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,599
on the irrigation system and having the

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,359
whole row watered at once

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,439
going into each individual plant can be

20
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,238
great for monitoring purposes and help

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,079
ensure

22
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,359
every plant gets the water that they

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,799
need

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,640
there's also the importance with hand

25
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,919
watering of nozzle selection

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,920
depending on the stage of plant

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,920
development growers may want to change

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,920
the nozzle they use when they water

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
there are many options not just one

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,760
option uh that's mini grossing oh just a

31
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:02,959
nozzle at the end of a hose well there's

32
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,798
a lot of options

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,000
early on keep in mind that plants are

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,080
fragile so

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,359
an even watering nozzle held so the

36
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,319
water points up

37
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,840
and gently falls down is advised later

38
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,559
in the season volume may be more

39
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,439
important

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,200
to deliver so more water to water more

41
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,478
plants in a shorter period of time

42
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,640
so this is why you may want to make

43
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,159
these different changes i would advise

44
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
in generally against the high pressure

45
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
nozzles as we see here

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,359
cleaning used more for cleaning and

47
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,719
pressure washing

48
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,400
kind of want that nice kind of

49
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,158
simulation of that nice gentle

50
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,439
rain flow there if you don't use a

51
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,479
nozzle it can kind of

52
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,438
create a lot of soil splash or splash

53
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,840
just in general

54
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,519
which might not be advantageous for your

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,159
growing area

56
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,840
lastly consistency the goal is to ensure

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,880
consistent water delivered to the plants

58
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
from day to day

59
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,920
and also over the entire growing season

60
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,759
the plants

61
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
requirements will change so the grower

62
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,319
needs to make the necessary adjustments

63
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,200
when needed to avoid plant stress just

64
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,359
because you need

65
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,478
x amount of seconds upper water when

66
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,759
they're first starting out

67
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,519
you want to make sure you're adjusting

68
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,560
to those plant needs as those plants

69
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,878
grow and change

70
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,759
over their grow cycle to ensure you're

71
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,120
delivering

72
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,238
a consistency to match the plant demand

73
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,159
and not shortening the plants or

74
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,360
overwatering the plants to ensure that

75
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,680
nice even

76
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,800
growth and to not overly stress them or

77
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,959
potentially cause

78
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,840
an increased chance for diseases at the

79
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,840
root level
