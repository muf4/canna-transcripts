1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,279
so you want to grow your cannabis

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,278
indoors well what are some

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,080
considerations for indoor production of

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:07,599
cannabis

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,519
i'm going to go over some of the details

6
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,879
here and if you are considering it

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,798
hopefully give you some ideas to think

8
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,679
about if you are growing animals indoors

9
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,160
already

10
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,870
some review of some of the key aspects

11
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:26,000
you should be having under control

12
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:26,880
[Music]

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,480
all right let's get into the

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,599
considerations for indoor cannabis

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,079
production

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
so first off with our indoor environment

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,920
the goal should be

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,280
quality and not quantity if quantity is

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,359
your goal you want to consider an

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,879
outdoor operation of a separate video on

21
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,679
that here in debaco

22
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,519
university you also have control over

23
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,039
conditions in the indoor environment so

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,879
the goal is to maximize

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
production remember that there are

26
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,039
different pla environmental

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,960
target ranges as the plant grows to

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,000
maximize the end product the grower

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,679
should make sure

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,198
that they're adjusting to those changes

31
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,359
to match the stage

32
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,558
of the plant development you don't want

33
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
to keep the temperature always the same

34
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,560
the humidity always the same

35
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,400
from the seedling stage or the clone

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,600
stage all the way to the harvest stage

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,439
you want to maximize that target range

38
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,719
as that plant grows and develops some of

39
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,478
those are going to start to shift and

40
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,719
change for example humidity

41
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,000
very early on might need higher humidity

42
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,478
and they're going to be decreasing that

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
as the plant grows and develops

44
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,679
and we're talking about this plant

45
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
growing for an indoor environment

46
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
it tends to have greater upfront cost so

47
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,600
you want to know what your budget is and

48
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,839
you know that from a very early on so

49
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,078
you can scale your operation

50
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,359
both the initial investment and also the

51
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:38,798
ongoing cost

52
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,000
consider the electricity to run the

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,200
lights just because you spend all your

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,879
budget on lighting

55
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
well you're gonna have to also supply

56
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,959
that with electricity

57
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,719
also have to supply money to cool that

58
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,640
looking at carbon dioxide enrichment you

59
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,438
know buying the bottles yes buying the

60
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,359
setup great

61
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,519
but then also supplementing with more

62
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,959
carbon dioxide as the growing season

63
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,840
goes on

64
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,559
now a simplified indoor growing kind of

65
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,320
checklist

66
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,759
you want to make sure of your size your

67
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,839
growing area appropriately

68
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,759
have proper monitoring systems growing

69
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,159
substrate containers air circulation and

70
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,680
ventilation such as hvac systems

71
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,520
lighting carbon accident enrichment and

72
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
irrigation are just a few things

73
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,760
you want to be making sure you consider

74
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,878
and have a plan for

75
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,639
so we're going to go into those just

76
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,000
briefly here and going to be more videos

77
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,839
on this in more detail well first

78
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,840
off the growing area we're talking about

79
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,280
indoor operation or how big

80
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,360
are we talking to grow tent and grow

81
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,439
tens can be very small to quite large

82
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,879
we're talking just to grow room here we

83
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,199
can see a much larger

84
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,199
area here so what's going to be the size

85
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,958
of your growing operation

86
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,639
also what type of monitoring systems are

87
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,878
you going to be using i'm using a

88
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,639
digital system as we see here or an

89
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,318
analog system again both have their

90
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,238
merits and pros and cons

91
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,359
it'll be more videos on tobacco

92
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,519
university here

93
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,959
to explore some of the details and kind

94
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,599
of weigh some of the advantages and

95
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,439
disadvantages of each of these

96
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,959
now for a growing substrate are you

97
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,439
being are you going to grow in soilless

98
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,800
mix

99
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,878
are you going to choose to grow rock

100
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
wall maybe a cocoa car

101
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,158
maybe sand you know there's different

102
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
growing substrates again which one are

103
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:08,079
you going to choose which one's the best

104
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,959
fit

105
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,560
for your operation containers you might

106
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,519
just think good put the plant in well

107
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,519
what are you going to put the plant is

108
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,200
going to be a plastic container is it

109
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,000
going to be a solid wall plastic cleaner

110
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,359
is going to be an air

111
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,120
pot is it going to be a grow bag a fiber

112
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,480
kind of a fabric material to be a

113
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,519
biodegradable one

114
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,119
what's going to be the size of the

115
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,799
container all these are important

116
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,280
considerations

117
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,680
for that air circulation in ventilation

118
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,759
uh what about the horizontal airflow

119
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,519
you see here multiple fans going what

120
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,039
about the vertical airflow

121
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
uh the cooling of the lights how are you

122
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,679
going to mount the different

123
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,280
fans and how you're going to make sure

124
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,799
you're maintaining a proper temperature

125
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,439
what type of hvac system you're going to

126
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,920
have

127
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,199
all important considerations the

128
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,399
artificial lighting is you're growing

129
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,158
indoors you don't have the advantage of

130
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
the sun you're going to use led lighting

131
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,598
high pressure sodium lighting as you can

132
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
see here led high pressure sodium

133
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,438
ceramic metal halide t5 fluorescence

134
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,519
you know what's going to be your chosen

135
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,959
artificial light to use and are going to

136
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,519
necessarily use the sum

137
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,400
same one for the full uh growth cycle of

138
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,000
your canvas plants are going to

139
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,560
transition them from one to another

140
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,919
to another and why would you do that uh

141
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,438
carbonated enrichment

142
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,319
so we're looking at kind of enriching an

143
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,839
area elevating our carbon dioxide levels

144
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,439
what level are we going to chew for

145
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,798
where we're going to place our sensor

146
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,000
how are we going to deliver that we're

147
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,879
going to be some sources of carbon

148
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,560
dioxide

149
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,478
is it going to be a heat source is it

150
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,160
going to be a compressed bottle

151
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,918
what controllers and regulators are we

152
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,360
going to utilize are we going to be able

153
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:32,478
to use something called fuzzy logic if

154
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
we're using a bottle system that would

155
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,478
be advised

156
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,319
different ways or things to consider and

157
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,800
then lastly kind of on our just quick

158
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,000
general checklist provided here

159
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,360
irrigation how we're going to be

160
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,199
supplying water to our plant it can be

161
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
hydroponic layers can be hand wadding

162
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,240
we use a certain type of water

163
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,759
purification

164
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,600
you know what are we going to be doing

165
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
to help ensure that our plants not only

166
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
are receiving water

167
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,879
by receiving quality water and at a

168
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,919
regular basis so that doesn't restrict

169
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,120
their production

170
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,519
so again if you're thinking about indoor

171
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,439
