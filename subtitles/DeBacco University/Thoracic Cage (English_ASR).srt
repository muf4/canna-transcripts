1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
okay here I provide a brief overview of

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:07,410
the thoracic cage see some of the main

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,080
components here are costal cartilage you

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,289
kitted in red the sternum is that Center

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,048
bone here and then the ribs located on

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,969
the end here so starting with that kind

7
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:21,210
of bony thorax or rib cage

8
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:24,419
notice that the ribs are labeled 1

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,278
through 12 starting at the top here and

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,618
working your way down we have that

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,929
sternum at the end of the sternum skull

12
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:33,750
design fight process as the little kind

13
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:37,109
of portions to hang out down here see an

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,350
eye inversion here this is the superior

15
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,850
and inferior orientation this should

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,309
help you if you understand these terms

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,620
the orientation of the bone in the body

18
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:48,530
you could see the sternum or body of

19
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,000
that sternum here located right here

20
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,620
focus a little bit more on the ribs and

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,820
the cartilage and how these kind of

22
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,238
interrelate and how we can identify

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,189
different types of ribs so there's three

24
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:03,030
main classifications of ribs there's

25
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:05,399
true and also called fixed ribs these

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,310
are indicated in a red here these are

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,409
just rip tears that are directly or

28
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,900
indirectly attached to the sternum as we

29
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,850
can see there's a direct attachment and

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,219
here's kind of indirectly this white

31
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:19,408
region here is actually cartilage but

32
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,629
you see each is individually connected

33
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,270
to this sternum false ribs

34
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:26,789
our ribs eat through 12 - see down here

35
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,938
and they connect the sternum indirectly

36
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,118
via costal cartilages of the ribs above

37
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:35,099
that connect to the sternum directly any

38
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:39,118
what that basically means is here's our

39
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,978
two false ribs connecting here and this

40
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,500
cartilage then is joined together in

41
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:45,658
that connects directly to the sternum

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,250
here we're seeing a rib directly

43
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,618
connecting directly connecting directly

44
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,149
connecting to certain these false ribs

45
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:52,590
are all joined together and we'll see

46
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,649
that in another image this cartilage

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,868
that then joins to the sternum lesson

48
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,000
the floating ribs and is there in blue

49
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:02,540
and this one probably should also be in

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,828
blue right here refers to the lowermost

51
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:08,250
11 and 12 so actually this one should

52
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:10,228
have a little cartilage here there's so

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,930
called because they attached only to the

54
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,830
vertebra in the back here they do not

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,080
have a direct

56
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,390
to the sternum or cartilage of the

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,969
sternum these ribs are relatively small

58
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:23,549
and delicate and they include kind of

59
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:25,800
Cardinal cartilage at the very tip of

60
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,140
them can give you a little bit Orion

61
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,670
different orientation here the costal

62
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:31,109
cartilage are segments of the carlo's

63
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:32,789
that connects the sternum to the ribs

64
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,340
and helps extend the ribs into the

65
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:37,530
forward motion this College also

66
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,539
confirms to the elasticity within the

67
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,189
walls of the thorax allowing the chest

68
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,979
to expand in compressed during

69
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:47,250
respiration we see here our floating

70
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:49,199
ribs in the back and our false ribs here

71
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,930
and these are joining and attaching this

72
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,849
cartilage then attaches to the sternum

73
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,590
our true ribs are the ones right here

74
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,019
and they're directly attaching to the

75
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,610
sternum in the classroom we also have

76
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,040
skeleton you're welcome to take a look

77
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,100
at that and see how the different ribs

78
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,919
look how they're oriented and can you

79
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:10,259
identify what it's a false rib what's a

80
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,439
floating rib and what's a true or fixed

81
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,439
room
