1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,048
with the potential for co2 to increase

2
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:06,869
yields there's a lot of products

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,570
entering the marketplace that state that

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,519
they generate co2 but a lot of the

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,559
methods out there that are cheaper it's

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,079
going to be a very inefficient co2

7
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:18,329
generation method so what I cover just a

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,339
little bit about what areas you should

9
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:21,989
be kind of a concern if you're

10
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,820
considering that adding co2 is a great

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,409
thing or something you want to add what

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,660
are some more efficient methods and what

13
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,460
are some inefficient methods so

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,730
inefficient co2 generation methods those

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,390
messes that do generate co2 so they are

16
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,520
potentially stating they're generating

17
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,289
co2 and they are however but the amount

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,660
can be inconsistent and create variable

19
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,100
conditions typically they're cheaper

20
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,199
because you're not using a pressurized

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,320
tank or propane to burn for heat and

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,640
that really good way to regulate them

23
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,859
there's high variability to the

24
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,989
conditions that they can create also

25
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,850
there can be a lack of consistency which

26
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:55,409
could help increase the odds of variable

27
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,780
and the results so even if you have

28
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:00,509
success with one of these systems

29
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,939
replicating those successful results can

30
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:05,390
be a quite a challenge you should all be

31
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:08,579
considered if the gross space is small

32
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,659
for example be a small grow 10 and

33
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,609
you're operating with the idea if

34
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,750
something is better than nothing so I

35
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,420
want you to think that oh if you get one

36
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,250
of these systems typically fermentation

37
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,228
could be an option here on that they're

38
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,329
going to deal kind of consistent results

39
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:23,700
or they can be used in large operations

40
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:25,259
they're inefficient but something is

41
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,020
better than nothing they might be worth

42
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,239
consideration some of those methods for

43
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:32,728
co2 generation include the active

44
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,158
compost fermentation using dry ice which

45
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:36,900
is solid carbon dioxide mixing baking

46
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,079
soda and vinegar and there's some other

47
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,299
proprietary products out there also

48
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,129
however all these are poorly regulated

49
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,890
and only have a chance to work in very

50
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,030
small spaces dry ice or solid co2 my

51
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,689
think though that's just perfect

52
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,280
however how high in where it's being

53
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:55,289
released and how much is being released

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,939
that can cause some issues active

55
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,368
compost and fermentation yes it is

56
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,839
releasing co2 but based on the sugars

57
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:03,390
you feed the microbes based on the

58
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,920
release based on the mixing a lot of

59
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,379
these aren't regulated for day and night

60
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,300
cycles this is why I consider all these

61
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,848
to be inefficient methods of generating

62
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,800
co2 because while they do generate some

63
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,939
carbon dioxide

64
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,620
guess something is better than nothing

65
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,329
but if you're really looking at

66
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,759
efficiencies you might want to consider

67
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,530
other options that are more precise and

68
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,030
while they may cost more initially they

69
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,030
will ensure more consistent results
