1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,759
welcome to this debacco University video

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,200
well where there's a collaboration with

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,160
Shane from migro here he's going to

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,080
discuss and get into some of the details

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,039
of different light spectrums and how

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,118
they impact plants to determine what

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:18,038
color is best for plant growth so

8
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:19,640
hopefully we'll get some data here uh

9
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,560
comparing particularly these two lights

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,210
that we have pictured here to give you

11
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:28,268
an informed decision before you make a

12
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,269
[Music]

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
purchase

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,799
well welcome everyone we have Shane here

15
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,558
again from migro looking specifically

16
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:43,718
here we're going to look at the effect

17
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:45,679
of blue green red light on plant growth

18
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,160
this always you know begs the question

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,759
of do the other colors matter we talked

20
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,959
about photosynthesis and Par and

21
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,358
intensity in some other videos but we're

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,079
looking at Blue we're looking at Green

23
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,600
we're looking at Red what do these

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,480
colors are these the most important

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,480
colors do we need a blending of these

26
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:03,159
colors what do these colors do to the

27
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,599
plant so I'll leave it to Shane to give

28
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,640
us a little bit more insight into these

29
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,959
three main colors and how they affect

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,478
plant growth so if we C covered before

31
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,679
par that is photosynthetically active

32
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,438
radiation is the light that plants use

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,720
and the photosynthesis reaction so they

34
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:25,399
used to grow and the range of light

35
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:28,759
intensity in par ranges from 400 NM up

36
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,200
to 700 nanm that in visual terms is is

37
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:36,759
blue green and red so this full spectrum

38
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:40,200
of visible light and plants do react a

39
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,879
little differently um to those different

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,118
Spectrum uh starting off with blue

41
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:49,078
Spectrum so blue generally will moderate

42
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:51,200
plant height and it does that by

43
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,478
moderating the internodal distances

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,680
that's the the distance between branches

45
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:59,438
in the plant um if we have a low

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,079
percentage or an absence of Blue from

47
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:05,959
the light Spectrum plants will generally

48
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:08,799
tend to grow uh taller and

49
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,120
stretch H this is not what we want in an

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,920
indoor growing situation we want short

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,280
dense plants H we want that so they

52
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,799
don't go out of control and that they

53
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,360
stay within our grow area we also want

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,120
that because we want the plants to put

55
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,680
the energy into flowers and not

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,599
necessarily lots of stalks uh and

57
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,280
branches the other Spectrum so we move

58
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:35,598
to green green I would see sort of as as

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,800
a fairly neutral in terms of plant shape

60
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,079
um so a higher or lower proportion of

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,159
green will generally not change the um

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,640
the plant shape however it does have

63
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:49,120
benefits in terms of the cinity Green in

64
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:52,199
that it um it goes deeper so it

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,599
penetrates deeper into the leaf than

66
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:58,280
blue or red um enabling photosynthesis

67
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:01,679
deeper into the leaf tissue it also will

68
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,840
B Bounce Around in the canopy um and

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,599
therefore having green as part of the

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,840
spectrum gives higher rate of whole

71
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,560
plant

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,959
photosynthesis um so including it does

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,158
increase the overall photosynthesis

74
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,199
occurring uh the rate of it occurring

75
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:22,079
then red red again is is not um does not

76
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:26,798
affect plant shape as

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:31,280
such however it is the most photos

78
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,319
photosynthetically efficient um so it uh

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,680
red photons will cause more

80
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,639
photosynthesis in relative terms than

81
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,319
than blue or green not a huge

82
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,438
differences but it's significant and

83
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,560
also red photons are lower energy

84
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:47,519
photons and that that means they're

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,878
electrically um easier to produce or

86
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,280
cheaper to produce from an energy point

87
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,679
of view so um red is very useful to have

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,598
in part your spectrum to increase the

89
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,120
whole system efficiency both from

90
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:03,399
electrical and a photosynthetic point of

91
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,920
view yeah thanks for that breakdown of

92
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,840
there the blue keeping the plants nice

93
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,798
and kind squatty morphology definitely

94
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,799
important for indoor Growers which

95
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,840
typically are the ones using

96
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,519
supplemental lighting the ever

97
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,039
controversial green light where you

98
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,358
right is Bounce Around does kind of

99
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,560
reflect in there um does deeply

100
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,198
penetrate into the canopy and then the

101
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,720
red light we hear a lot about when

102
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,600
lighting you know the uh red intense

103
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,680
light or more red you know kind of as

104
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,000
you get into flower or some higher red

105
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,079
producing bulbs is true that is easier

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,120
to produce and it also has those plant

107
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,719
benefits as well that brings up the

108
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,519
question you know if we hear a lot about

109
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,639
these different colorations are they all

110
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,879
needing the same amount or intensity or

111
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,240
should there be times where we're

112
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,439
shifting should we worry about one more

113
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,400
than another uh just speak to those kind

114
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,399
of spect those um wavelengths on how

115
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,560
they relate to the plant and what it

116
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,478
needs and the intensity of each yeah so

117
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,879
as I said with regard to Blue it is

118
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:02,758
critical um for indoor Growers to have

119
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:06,478
blue in the Spectrum it's been shown

120
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,160
that about 3% a minimum about 3% blue is

121
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,038
sufficient to get a reasonably short

122
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,960
growth however increasing that

123
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:16,199
percentage blue up to maybe 12 15% will

124
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:19,519
give you increasingly shorter plants so

125
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:23,038
it is beneficial to have up to around

126
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,198
15% blue in the Spectrum um for indoor

127
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,000
Growers just to to ensure that the

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,199
plants are short as dense as possible

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,478
beyond that um it doesn't really add any

130
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,720
extra benefit and increase beyond that

131
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,879
level um generally then having that

132
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,400
minimum amount of blue which is critical

133
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:45,800
with the balance of the spectrum as as

134
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,719
we said before red is the most efficient

135
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,840
um so we're looking to have as much red

136
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,360
as possible um and then a filler of

137
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,399
green uh and green being critical as we

138
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,800
said earlier for you know that that

139
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,519
whole plant photosynthesis but also so

140
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,639
that we can see the plants so mixing the

141
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,318
blue green and red if anybody remembers

142
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,478
from school that equals white light and

143
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:11,039
white light is visually allows allows us

144
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,399
to visually see the plants clearly

145
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,839
inspect the plants see any

146
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:19,079
deficiencies um in the plants regard to

147
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:22,079
nutrients or or pest disease that type

148
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:26,038
of thing so white light overall having a

149
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,839
mixture of of blue green and red is um

150
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,519
is beneficial from the whole plant point

151
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,318
of view plant Health point of view from

152
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,519
the photosynthetic efficiency point of

153
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,319
view and also for for us the grower to

154
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,478
see what's going

155
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,879
on that's I like having this

156
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,519
collaboration I like the Quant the

157
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:43,079
quantifying for the blue light and the

158
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,959
percentages and how that will affect

159
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,719
different plants and that importance of

160
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,959
white light not only for the plant

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,680
itself but as you mentioned it on so

162
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,959
well is that grower being able to walk

163
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,240
down that plant inspect that plant pick

164
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,038
out potential nutrient defici potential

165
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,879
insects potential disease uh much much

166
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:02,279
quicker than if you're growing under

167
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,120
kind of a filtered light that's only one

168
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:06,239
particular wavelength or limited

169
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,879
wavelength it does make it much harder

170
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,759
for even uh well well trange Growers to

171
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,439
be able to pick out differences that

172
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,800
white light looks nice makes it really

173
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,120
easy um and really allows to Growers

174
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,560
hopefully to appreciate their plants and

175
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,478
to notice if one's not going quite right

176
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,639
so again thank you for your detail here

177
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:27,839
on the breaking down that blue green and

178
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:32,800
red light and hope this helps everyone

179
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,799
out better understand these spectrums of

180
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,399
light
