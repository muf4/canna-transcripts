1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
okay here we look at the kingdoms of

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,949
life and we're going to use this simple

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:10,018
and basic six kingdom system you'll

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,388
notice we have our Eukarya up here and

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,179
our prokaryotes down here these are

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,939
still classified and each is its own

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,579
independent Kingdom and all supports

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,529
life in some way

9
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:24,899
so this kingdoms of life the designation

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,609
of kingdoms has changed over the years

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,948
we're going to focus on one particular

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,769
system originally there were only two

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,469
kingdoms as more organisms or obtained

14
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:37,949
in the numbers of kingdoms increased the

15
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,840
taxonomic level are the higher than a

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,309
kingdom has also been recognized we call

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,609
that the domain that's a broader

18
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:46,378
category or way to categories things so

19
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,829
here's some different approaches reduce

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:52,289
this rose example from 1977 this six

21
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,170
kingdom system where you bacterial

22
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,899
architect archaea bacteria protozoa

23
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,530
plants fungi and animals that's what we

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,539
do now you'll notice way back if you

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,400
watch some of the previous videos talked

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,560
about a simple to Kingdom system where

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,450
simple plants and animals we have since

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,728
learned there's more divisions than that

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,579
all the way up to potentially eight

30
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:16,859
divisions in us that just because we're

31
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,179
choosing this six kingdom system does

32
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,849
not mean there's other six kingdoms

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,650
systems that also exist this is going to

34
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:23,849
fit our purposes for our class but I

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,549
want you to realize that there are

36
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,129
different ways to potentially classify

37
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,960
living organisms this has been one we're

38
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:35,578
going to most widely use definitely in

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:38,039
this class so our phylogenetic tree of

40
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,629
life notes are bacteria or archaea in

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,719
our you carry out and what classifies

42
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:44,548
what classifies as certain categories

43
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,280
right here this is again just an example

44
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,770
we see the branch points and the closer

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,109
things are to one another though more

46
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:54,989
closely they are related and we're gonna

47
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:58,560
spend a couple videos on different

48
00:01:54,989 --> 00:02:01,140
organizations of these these are more

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,780
closely related to each other then

50
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,180
either is to bacteria because if you

51
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,848
notice this branch point here both these

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,280
stem from the same area these branch out

53
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,500
earlier indicating these bacteria are

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,069
more distantly related

55
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,650
these two are to each other so the k6

56
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,840
kingdom system that Universal ancestor

57
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,230
that common ancestor and then we branch

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,450
out and this is a one stick figure way

59
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,189
of presenting it this is kind of bubble

60
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:30,599
way and this is another way kind of like

61
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:32,669
this one i use this when you've seen it

62
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,079
in some of the other slides because it

63
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:36,389
kind of puts a little picture sort of

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,480
animal you see the example of literally

65
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,799
an animal like a fish here fungi looks

66
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,829
like a mushroom plants kinda looks like

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,820
a leaf and so on and so forth so you can

68
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,680
see our Protista ru bacteria and kind of

69
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,479
this gives a little bit of description a

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,560
very brief description of what each is

71
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:58,469
so how does this look

72
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,780
on the diagram or relationship among the

73
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,819
six kingdom system so here's our

74
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,860
original cell what I'm saying division

75
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:09,719
points beyond there and whatever is

76
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,680
shares a same division point shares that

77
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,819
common ancestor so these archaea these

78
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,370
three different archaea are very closely

79
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,759
related and very distantly related to

80
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,099
say bacteria well notice here though we

81
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,310
see our mitochondria in our chloroplast

82
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:30,299
kind of bridging this gap from bacteria

83
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,039
to kind of the kingdom of Eukarya so

84
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,500
these are symbiotic events these are

85
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,989
events that occurred in both our

86
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,489
photosynthetic bacteria and also our

87
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,549
purple bacteria with the mitochondria

88
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,829
remember remember are the theories we

89
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:45,959
talked about of the endosymbiotic theory

90
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,610
where mitochondria and chloroplasts or

91
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,140
once free-living bacteria

92
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,799
they've been incorporated into

93
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:54,449
eukaryotes this example here again of

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,180
our six kingdom system provides the

95
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:59,819
domain the kingdom cell type structures

96
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,489
in number of cells the mode of nutrition

97
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,829
and examples of them these are different

98
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:08,129
ways we can classify them in a ways that

99
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,959
we can see how each is unique so a cell

100
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,150
type remember of prokaryotes versus our

101
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,209
eukaryotes eukaryotes remembering bound

102
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,329
organelles prokaryotes are not this

103
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,918
domain of Eukarya is very broad within a

104
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,840
eukaryote there's protesters funding

105
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,579
there's plants and there's animals those

106
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,279
are domain of bacteria and archaea are

107
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:27,418
separate and of course we have our pit

108
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,758
of lichen

109
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:31,318
walls for our bacteria if you remember

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,259
when we did we talked about the Gram

111
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,180
stain a unicellular I'll both of these

112
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,439
are unicellular most of these are

113
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,788
multicellular there might be a couple

114
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,569
that are you can say labels in the fungi

115
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:44,370
Oh for all Eukarya as far as plants and

116
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:47,218
animals gauss's are all multicellular

117
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,019
and they do some examples so just a nice

118
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:51,389
little kind of comparison can you be

119
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,788
able to compare or understand a little

120
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:56,610
bit about what makes the classification

121
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:58,968
for each of these kingdoms unique and

122
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,968
different
