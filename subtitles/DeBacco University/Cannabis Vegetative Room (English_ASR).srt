1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,258
the important room in the in the

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,970
production of canvas is the vegetative

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,099
room so while this may not have the

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:09,629
initial visual appeal of flowers or just

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,300
producing leaves here it's a very

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,360
critical room and very important one to

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,100
be mindful of so the lighting of this

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,528
room is important so this room would

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,960
favor a metal halide or the new ceramic

10
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,920
metal halides or even full-spectrum LED

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,480
lights running at about 18 to 24 hours

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,070
minimum would be about 16 I won't really

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,528
go in much under that you start running

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,130
the risk of cutting the prematurely go

15
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:33,630
in the flower

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,219
these lights help here for the

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,840
development necessary leaves and be

18
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,719
slightly smaller than the final flower

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,329
room so these plants will be smaller so

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,039
they can be a little more packed in but

21
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,299
maintaining that lightning hitting that

22
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,519
continuous hours of light is very

23
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,128
important this is where timers become

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,520
your friend and they're very critical to

25
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:55,799
maintain that 18 to 24 hours as I said

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,510
that full spectrum LEDs or ceramic metal

27
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,750
halides are preferred lights for this

28
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:02,579
particular instance now the vegetative

29
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,869
room can make or break the crop well

30
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,510
this may not have the visual appeal of a

31
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,489
full flower room is a very important

32
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,810
critical room preparing plants for the

33
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,179
soon-to-be stress of flowering is

34
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,409
important so we typically you don't

35
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,880
think of it as the money room the

36
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,490
vegetative room being where the dollars

37
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,099
remain but that preparation step is very

38
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:22,438
important if the plants aren't prepared

39
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,339
right the flower room will suffer even

40
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:25,589
though the flower room has a visual

41
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,210
appeal of the flowers it's very

42
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,070
important to having a well-prepared

43
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:31,559
plant before it goes through the stress

44
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:33,539
is all flowering and when you're

45
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,250
fertilizing the vegetative room you want

46
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,470
to monitor growth and fertilizers very

47
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,569
likely required at regular intervals

48
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,340
growth formulas which are typically

49
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,109
higher in nitrogen are favored during

50
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,640
the stage of development you want to be

51
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:47,118
mindful of the amount that you're

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,379
fertilizing if you over fertilize

53
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,030
especially with irrigation water and

54
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,789
overhead the nitrogen furnace of

55
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,500
breaking stems and branches this coming

56
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,618
through the pruning or trellising

57
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,299
process I just become more brittle so

58
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,828
this is just a word of caution that you

59
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,420
don't want to have this happen because

60
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:04,978
they may have to go through a moving PHA

61
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,649
the physical moving phase before they go

62
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:10,050
to the flowering room lastly here

63
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,090
cleanliness is happiness this is where

64
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,910
the important art of pruning comes into

65
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,979
play where you can see all these

66
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,990
properly trained you want to keep the

67
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:19,579
floor clean they won't know any dead

68
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,439
leaves either in the pots are on the

69
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,310
floor through queries constant

70
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,069
maintenance

71
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,780
sweeping and pruning and removing of any

72
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,579
dead leaves because if you keep the area

73
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,240
clean you'll reduce the chance of

74
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:35,980
diseases and ensure a happy crop for

75
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,980
both the plants and also the grower
