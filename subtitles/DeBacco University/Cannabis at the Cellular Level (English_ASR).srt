1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,068
here we're going to look at cannabis at

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,378
the cellular level so plants are

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:09,809
composed of systems plant the organism

4
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:11,879
have a collection of systems that work

5
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:14,218
together to produce a functional plant

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,589
two main systems include the chute

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,660
system which is what we see here and the

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:22,320
low grad we have the supporting root

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,480
system now the plant organs work in

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,550
unison to perform a unique function for

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,379
the plant there's that chute system that

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,630
we typically see above ground are the

13
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,549
leaves the stems in the flower leaves

14
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:33,869
capture the sun's energy the stems

15
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,299
support the plant structure and the

16
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,519
flower is a site of reproduction below

17
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,409
ground here the root system we have the

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,180
primary which are the main thick roots

19
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:44,519
the lateral roots which are initially

20
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,439
branched from the primary root and then

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,989
we really can't see are really fine

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,399
structures we call root hairs these are

23
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:51,750
at the end of the lateral roots in their

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,780
mainstay of nutrient and water

25
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,090
absorption so these very thin small

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,340
regions have a very high surface area

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,829
allowing for efficient absorption of

28
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,558
nutrients and water in the soil or

29
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,879
substrate now the organs contain

30
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,250
specialized tissues that allow for

31
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,079
proper function we see here the leaves

32
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,969
which contain chloroplasts which is

33
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,750
these main site for the photosynthetic

34
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:17,188
process the stems contain xylem and

35
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,409
phloem which help me with water and

36
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:21,688
nutrients to the plant flowers contain

37
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,978
either male or female structures

38
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:25,199
this plant is too young to tell whether

39
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:28,560
it's a male or a female so in here is a

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,030
female structure here fruits have the

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,829
epidermis which is the outer covering

42
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,650
which is similar function to yours it

43
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:36,959
offers protection and the contain the

44
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,670
ground and vascular tissues again the

45
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,298
main site of nutrient and water

46
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,879
absorption in those plant tissues is

47
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,740
organized cells we have guard cells

48
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,868
which regulate water and carbon dioxide

49
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,938
exchange these guard cells are on the

50
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:53,759
underside of leaves and they are pores

51
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:55,169
and plants need to breathe so this is

52
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,319
kind of what helps allow them to breathe

53
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,329
and expel water and then when it's a ton

54
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,728
of water stress it will close what we

55
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,519
call the stomata which are pores on the

56
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:07,259
under mainly on the underside of leaves

57
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,329
xylem cells transport mainly water and

58
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,770
minerals in one direction from the roots

59
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,930
to the shoots from the bottom of the

60
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,770
plant to the top of the plant and pollen

61
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,540
is the mail

62
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,450
sex sells we see kind of here cotton a

63
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:21,629
little bit of the wind all these work in

64
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:23,519
unison all aspects of the plan including

65
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,199
photosynthesis growth development are

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,689
all controlled by the genetic material

67
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,549
or the DNA we see that double helix

68
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,930
structure here it's located mainly in

69
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,219
the nucleus of the cell but it's

70
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,990
organized into structures called

71
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,609
chromosomes however there are some

72
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,300
unique DNA found in both the

73
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,950
mitochondria and the chloroplasts plant

74
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,510
regulations will living systems need to

75
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:44,250
be able to maintain a relatively stable

76
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:46,199
internal conditions despite ever

77
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,180
fluctuating external conditions in order

78
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,339
to stay alive this process of

79
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,770
maintaining this balance here is called

80
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,210
homeostasis now this is balancing

81
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,890
internal conditions so it's not like

82
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,770
maintaining homeostasis with time and

83
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:00,239
money as is internal conditions this

84
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,030
process is often regulated by hormones

85
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,189
which are produced in the cells to allow

86
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,849
the plant or in this case in the

87
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:11,009
organism to counteract changes in their

88
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,989
external conditions to maintain that

89
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:15,949
stable internal environment we call

90
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,950
homeostasis
