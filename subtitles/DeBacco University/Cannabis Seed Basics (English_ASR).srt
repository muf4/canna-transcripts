1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
okay human focus I'm chemist seed basics

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,390
misused a general seed pictured here

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,189
where we have the seed coat which is the

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:11,070
outer shell the embryo contains the hypo

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,990
coddles or radical and the cotyledons so

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,469
let's look specifically at cannabis

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,839
seeds

8
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,939
well seeds in general whether it's a

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,300
cannabis or a tomato or a pepper seed

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,279
all contain living but dormant organism

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,070
so this is important to remember that

12
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,589
there in that seed is a living organism

13
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:32,009
and as it organism dies that will reduce

14
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:34,979
the germination rate a lot of seeds now

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,600
the DNA is also present in these seeds

16
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,429
which will determine the characteristics

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,350
of the plant in selecting the proper

18
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,210
seed or really more appropriate term

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,520
leading the proper genetics to match the

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,600
growing conditions is important items to

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,180
consider or whether you're growing

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,760
indoors or outdoors looking for THC or

23
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,009
CBD production keep in mind this course

24
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,109
is focusing on hemp plants so a CBD

25
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,349
production would be one area would be

26
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,698
focused on much more than THC content

27
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,308
mature seeds have a dark coloration are

28
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:04,289
hard and they tend to be declaration

29
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,908
hard outer shell these tend to be the

30
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,070
most mature and have the greatest chance

31
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,330
for germination if you look at this kind

32
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:11,489
of lot seeds here this kind of

33
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:14,459
compilation of seeds well no some are

34
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:16,679
kind of white some are green these

35
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,390
colorations also indicate that these

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,570
tend to be softer seeds to the touch

37
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,009
these indicate immature seeds these will

38
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:24,779
have poor germination rates then the

39
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,549
harder outer shell that's typically

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,228
shown with this darker coloration here

41
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,979
the darker colors will have a greater

42
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:33,000
germination rate than the immature seeds

43
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:35,009
developed in a comparison between a

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,868
mature and immature seeds mature seed

45
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,090
should be full in uniform as we see here

46
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:41,069
give them a drop and listen for a thud

47
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,930
if you hear a hollow sound like these

48
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:45,359
seeds would give this is a sign of

49
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,820
immature seeds so you see the comparison

50
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,769
of these two was the dime there for size

51
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,989
orientation see these are very

52
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,519
consistent tend to be darker colorations

53
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:55,319
and to be more consistent larger size

54
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,849
these will likely have a much better

55
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,029
germination rate than these immature

56
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:01,199
seeds here see the anatomy we have the

57
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,090
seed codes they mentioned that's that

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,579
protective outer covering we have

59
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,810
cotyledons and kinases and dicot these

60
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:08,459
are the seed leaves and these be the

61
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,370
first ones to appear once the seed

62
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,599
murders the hypo coddled located right

63
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,360
here is the area of the stem

64
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,000
the roots in soil line and also the

65
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,470
cotyledon waves the radical is the

66
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,479
initial root that is produced from the

67
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,219
seed so we talked about emergence that's

68
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,349
the seed actually plant breaking through

69
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,909
the surface germination is typically

70
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:29,799
marked by this radical protruding

71
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:32,710
through the seed coat there be like a

72
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,410
little tail that you would notice proper

73
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,879
seed storage will controlling the

74
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:38,680
environment the seed is stored will help

75
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,650
increase germination percentages over

76
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,750
time key is consistency if there's a

77
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,719
rapid fluctuations and changes this can

78
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,639
decrease seed vitality however even

79
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,030
under ideal conditions germination rates

80
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,469
will decrease with the age of the seed

81
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,289
growing conditions the goal to try to

82
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:57,310
maintain as humidity under 10%

83
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:59,409
temperature from 40 degrees Fahrenheit

84
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,080
to zero degrees Fahrenheit and light

85
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:03,669
minimal light if any exposure let me

86
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,100
keep the seeds typically in the darker

87
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:08,789
in an area that is not having a lot of

88
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:11,680
consistent or very bright light exposure

89
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,900
she should be kept in some form of label

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,240
packaged in an environment as cool and

91
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,830
dark to be like a refrigerator a freezer

92
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,870
even a sock drawer in some cases

93
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,090
well the seeds will last about 5 years

94
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,890
if stored properly I want to be sure to

95
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,870
keep seeds away from moisture and this

96
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:27,489
is a concern as a preventative when

97
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,860
you're storing your seeds when I choose

98
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,800
an airtight container and these little

99
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,750
silica gel packets can be advised to be

100
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,480
included till Polson without moisture

101
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,099
out and labeling those pack those seeds

102
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,079
are very important because you could see

103
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,419
these could easily get mixed up so

104
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,240
keeping them labeled keeping them sealed

105
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:49,269
allows for reduction in the chance of

106
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,010
miss aligning different seeds and

107
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,580
ensuring you're growing what you think

108
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,799
you're growing

109
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,290
lastly canning jars offer an excellent

110
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,460
for seed storage these are airtight they

111
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:58,959
can hold many seeds in different

112
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,820
containers they fit easily in the

113
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,590
freezer or other locations they also

114
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,120
prevent unwanted interaction so I give

115
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,189
the example the mice here eating seeds

116
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,920
just keep the season like an envelope or

117
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:11,229
something when it gets cold out mice can

118
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,000
be for ASIS eaters and get into all

119
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:14,919
sorts of things you can easily choose

120
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,139
through paper or even sometimes plastic

121
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,569
containers mason jars here are sealed

122
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:23,668
glass airtight will prevent any unwanted

123
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:23,668
feeding on your seeds
