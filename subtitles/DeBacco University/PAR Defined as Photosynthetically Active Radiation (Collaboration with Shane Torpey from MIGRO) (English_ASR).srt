1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,479
to this unique debacco University video

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,759
because this is with a collaboration

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,000
with Shane from migro where we'll be

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,839
looking at the details of what par is

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,440
the definition of it looking at some par

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,000
maps and also some light intensity

7
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:19,000
related to plant production we have the

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,920
opportunity here to have Shane uh give

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,839
us some insight on these various

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,350
questions that many Growers have that I

11
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:27,408
hope you

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,409
[Music]

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,399
enjoy

14
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,079
hi guys doing a collaboration video

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:39,359
today I'm Shane the founder of migro

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,399
that's migro the grow lighting channel

17
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,039
available on YouTube and other social

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,198
media channels and I'm doing it today

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,719
with Matt from debaca University welcome

20
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:52,039
everyone this is Matthew debacco here

21
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,280
from debaca University here with Shane

22
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,399
from micro this wonderful collaboration

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,239
will hopefully provide you the great

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,198
insight into many of your lighting

25
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,280
questions well Shane thank you for uh uh

26
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,079
doing this collaboration you know with

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,400
lighting we hear a lot about Growers

28
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,959
they looking at things and they see

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,920
these three letters P par and they might

30
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,079
be wondering you know what is this how

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,680
is it measured and how does this relate

32
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,959
to something when we're looking at

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,479
artificial liting sure so par stands for

34
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,519
photosynthetically active radiation it's

35
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,400
a bit of a mouthful but what it means

36
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:29,599
quite simply is the light that plants

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,200
use for photosynthesis or growth there

38
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,039
is a broad mag

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,200
electromagnetic uh radiation Spectrum

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,520
from the Sun terms of nature we get all

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,799
the way from x-rays up to uh

42
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:46,840
microwaves and in the middle there

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,960
aligned with the visual um range of uh

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,079
of that radiation um plants will use

45
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:58,399
from Blue up to Red that's from 400 to

46
00:01:54,078 --> 00:02:00,478
700 nanometers wavelength of light H to

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,799
photosynthesize now

48
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,200
when we're measuring par we say that all

49
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,159
those um wavelengths are equal so uh a

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,759
unit of blue um will grow as much as for

51
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,199
example a unit of red it's not quite as

52
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,159
simple as that there's a little bit of

53
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:21,079
variability in it um but strict in in

54
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,519
simple terms we measure each uh band of

55
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,680
wavelength equally in terms of how it

56
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,439
contributes to plant growth there is

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,120
evidence of course that if you go down

58
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,359
into the UVA Spectrum so a little bit in

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,360
terms lower or shorter wavelength than

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,440
blue that that Al also causes

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,959
photosynthesis um but it is less

62
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,919
efficient than within the strict SP par

63
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,840
spectrum and the same goes from far red

64
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,719
which is um longer wave length to Red um

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,800
that's just getting out of the visible

66
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,000
spectrum but it does also contribute to

67
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
plant

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,199
growth now when we're looking at

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,080
artificial lighting you know we see a

70
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,000
lot of dimmer switches and you know you

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,519
can make adjustments so with par

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,120
understanding that it is this you know

73
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,080
wavelength of light that these plants

74
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,878
are utilizing wouldn't it be just

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,959
maximizing it to 10 crank it as close as

76
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:12,239
we can isn't more just better we trying

77
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,360
to replicate the Sun so speak to kind of

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,000
the intensity of par and how it relates

79
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,400
to plants yeah so when we're measuring

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,680
par we measured in in units called

81
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,319
micromoles and that's a count of the

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,680
number of photons um that are in the

83
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,839
light being

84
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,519
radiated um and if you take for for

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,640
example the Sun at midday uh in mid July

86
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,759
um it that would Peak at about 2,000

87
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:42,479
micromols um so quite a high level when

88
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,000
we are looking at indoor Growers most

89
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,679
indoor Growers growing cannabis uh would

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,878
grow probably at around 800 micro moles

91
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,319
is quite typical today however there is

92
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:57,078
research showing that plants will uh the

93
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,199
the rate of growth will increase if you

94
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,120
increase that that micromo level all the

95
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,518
way up to about 1,500 micro moles

96
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,079
however using a higher power intensity

97
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,640
than that particularly over a long

98
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,079
period of time the plants do have a

99
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,318
limitation as to how much they can

100
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,920
absorb H and in particular over the

101
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,000
length of the

102
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,839
day yeah so it's good to mention that

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,798
limitations so we're trying to be as

104
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,799
efficient with our lighting as possible

105
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,959
the electricity consumption and really

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,120
looking at final yield and you know

107
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,839
plant production so with that lot of

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,319
Growers you know we look at a light

109
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,918
scroll down hopefully you're finding

110
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,319
like you know these par Maps uh can you

111
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:36,159
there's a lot of numbers there's a lot

112
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,759
of you know variation there can you just

113
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
explain a little bit what Growers are

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,319
looking at when they take a look at a

115
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,879
par map of a light yeah so again when

116
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,879
we're measuring par we're measuring

117
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,800
micros micros per meter squar per second

118
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:52,600
we measure them using a a special sensor

119
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,360
called the quantum sensor and in order

120
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,080
to

121
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,240
determine um the effectiveness of a

122
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:03,478
lighting system we look at how

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,439
um the the par intensity that is the the

124
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:13,000
par level um right across a plant canopy

125
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:16,120
or a growing area and we do so by

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,918
measuring the par intensity across that

127
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,600
grow area usually in a grid a grid the

128
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,439
more squares in that Grid or the more

129
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,080
measurements in that grid the better

130
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,839
because we get a higher resolution and

131
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,159
that enables us to visually see the

132
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,038
power intensity right across the grow

133
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,160
area could be represented sometimes as a

134
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,599
heat map where you'd have you know sort

135
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,800
of going from cool to hot where the par

136
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,479
intensity raises from relatively low to

137
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,960
relatively high or it may just be shown

138
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:49,199
in terms of numbers very very useful

139
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:52,399
visual aid to understanding the

140
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,439
effectiveness of a lighting system and

141
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,239
how well it is going to how high the the

142
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,240
par intensity is going to be underneath

143
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,759
that fixture um in your grow t setup for

144
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,319
example and also the quality of the

145
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,840
distribution so how uniform it is across

146
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:11,039
that plant can be and I agree with that

147
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,758
uniformity is important it's a lot of

148
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,439
quotes might be for you know the highest

149
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,720
intensity but you want to see how that's

150
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,879
going to spread out over your grow tent

151
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,960
and also keep in mind the uh distance

152
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,199
between that and your plants can also

153
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,239
affect that so uh understanding those

154
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,319
par Maps looking how it compares to your

155
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,720
growing operation will allow you to make

156
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,598
a quality choice on the lighting you to

157
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,160
purchase and there's one thing I would

158
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:36,959
out of that which is um in terms of

159
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,199
hanging height of the fixture um to get

160
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,719
the most power intensity down onto the

161
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,360
growth generally you want to have the

162
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,880
fixture as low as possible as close to

163
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,479
the plant canopy as

164
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,399
possible however it is a compromise

165
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,680
because if you have it too low you get

166
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,279
very high power intensity directly under

167
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,120
the fixture but it won't spread out to

168
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,839
the edges so when you're looking at a

169
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,879
par map it's usually a compromise of

170
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,198
hanging the fixture as low as possible

171
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,039
but not too low that you get so that you

172
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,120
get an even and uniform spread over the

173
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,478
target

174
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,360
area thank you very much for this kind

175
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,478
of look at everything so when people go

176
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,400
through and look at these figures look

177
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,120
at these Maps they can apply it to their

178
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,318
situation and make an informed choice on

179
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,319
their

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
decision
