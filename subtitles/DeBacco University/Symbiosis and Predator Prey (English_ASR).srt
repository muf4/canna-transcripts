1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:05,878
here we're looking at symbiosis and

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:07,859
predator-prey relationship here's an

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,739
example of symbiosis we've got the bee

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,929
pollinating this flower and predator and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,780
prey there's always a bigger fish here's

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:19,140
a barracuda feeding on some sort of

7
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:21,239
baitfish here now we have something

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,278
called coevolution it's a term that

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,219
describes the long term evolutionary

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:29,698
adjustments of a species to one another

11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:32,250
so it's two or more species that exert

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,649
selective pressures on each other in the

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,090
evolved in response to each other so our

14
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,539
example here's our hummingbird in our

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,000
flower home bird is a very long beak

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:44,640
flower on the nectar is located very

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,269
deep in the flower so this is selecting

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,390
for this hummingbird to feed and

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,039
pollinate this particular flower so both

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,090
of these are adapting the kind of meet

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,280
the needs of each other

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,260
because each species is evolved in

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,750
response to each other one important

24
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,149
feature of coevolution is that selective

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,159
environment is constantly changing both

26
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,930
in coloration here in the depth of the

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,118
flower is really into that coevolution

28
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,170
that also the hummingbird is adjusting

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,819
to so how do we study coevolution

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,950
well coalition cited in several

31
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,829
different levels we have adaptions of

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,900
the individual to investigate on

33
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:24,090
interactions between the species and

34
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,000
broad evolutionary patterns this is

35
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,460
different than Co adaptation which is

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,519
referring to adaptations of certain

37
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:34,500
species much shorter term this could

38
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:37,560
refer to species adaptation processes

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,409
process by individuals genotypes and etc

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,180
I'll post a link in the description to

41
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,280
this video here helps to explain a

42
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,189
little bit more to us hosts and

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,570
pathogens co-evolved in together it's

44
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:53,789
constant competition that's occurring

45
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,859
co-adaptation now we have caterpillars

46
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,409
that secrete honeydew so hundreds a

47
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:01,200
sticky substance that ants like to drink

48
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,439
so sugary substance the ants defend the

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,420
caterpillars against parasitic wasps

50
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:09,179
added the honeydew secretion in defense

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,729
arco adaptations so the fact that the

52
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,009
caterpillars producing ideas at the ants

53
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:16,619
favour or like all

54
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,810
the answer addicted caterpillars I'm

55
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,060
getting attacked by these parasitic

56
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,430
wasps that literally lay eggs inside

57
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,650
them and cause the caterpillars to be

58
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,510
eaten from the inside out so the

59
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,890
honeydew that the ants like is

60
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:31,979
protecting the caterpillars from the

61
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:34,128
wasps pretty complex system welcome to

62
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,128
biology

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,390
how does co-adaptation

64
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,549
demonstrate coevolution so ballast have

65
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:44,429
a strict definition for coevolution in

66
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:47,400
its parallel evolution between taxes

67
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,430
required so we have the example here of

68
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,359
the hawk the bat and the dragonfly all

69
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,689
having developed some form of flight and

70
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:59,159
this is looking at parallel evolution

71
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:03,299
they're all developing the fact that

72
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:05,429
they can fly symbiosis this is a

73
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,319
condition which two or more kinds of

74
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,900
organisms live together in close

75
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,068
association just one another there's

76
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,930
three different types which we're going

77
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:16,439
to go into more detail mutualism

78
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,060
parasitism and communalism so we have

79
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,120
our example we could have our reefs here

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,009
with our fish and coral living together

81
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,560
mutualism both be both participating

82
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:26,848
species benefit parasitism one species

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,889
balance while the other is harmed

84
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,679
communalism one species benefits and the

85
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,689
other is neither harmed nor has any

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,329
benefit so one of these in more detail

87
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:38,370
starting to lism mutualism is a

88
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:41,359
relationship in which both species

89
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,099
benefit we have our answer Athens here

90
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,139
Athens provide the answer with food in

91
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:48,659
the form of continuous excreted honeydew

92
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:53,489
they're piercing the plant in giving the

93
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:55,079
ant very easy play-do access the ants

94
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,650
transport the agents to protect them

95
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,379
from predators

96
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,569
so the aphids can be attacked the ants

97
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,608
are protecting those aphids because

98
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:06,119
they're the ones giving them the

99
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:08,370
honeydew does sugar so this is why both

100
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,739
are benefiting because the ants getting

101
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,139
the honeydew and a fizzer given

102
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,539
protection ants defending aphids from

103
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,459
lady beetles ladybugs love to eat aphids

104
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,769
so the ant will actually help protect

105
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,280
that this case both species are

106
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:26,430
benefitting mutualism another example

107
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,168
here our ants

108
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,709
providing food ballads these kind of

109
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:33,629
large kind of structures here answer

110
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:36,089
provided organic nutrients of protecting

111
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,969
these flower regions these plant regions

112
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:40,849
from herbivores and shading from other

113
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,590
plants they're eliminating competition

114
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,660
and it is a result the plants able to do

115
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:49,649
better so the plants benefit benefit in

116
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,500
in the ants in this case they're getting

117
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:55,288
a benefit also so when both species are

118
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,300
benefiting again a both doing work but

119
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:59,189
in this case both are through the

120
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,538
relationship benefiting from the process

121
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:05,969
they are called mutualism ideally in

122
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:07,168
class you would be working together both

123
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,060
you and your lab partner would be

124
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:11,639
sharing ideas this would be the example

125
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,560
of mutualism both of you are working

126
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,389
towards a common goal both you may be

127
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,620
doing a slightly different things but in

128
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:21,720
the end both of you are benefitting in

129
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:24,180
contrast that with care to sit so a

130
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,080
parasite I mean I want to remember

131
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,459
parasites different in a predator so

132
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:32,819
parasitism symbiotic relationship in the

133
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:35,250
form of predation so the predator

134
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,168
parasite is much smaller than the prey

135
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,538
the prey does not necessarily need to

136
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:43,408
die prime example will be the mosquito

137
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:46,228
mosquito basically attaches to your skin

138
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:48,959
pierces your skin takes in the blood

139
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:52,199
from your body and then leaves this is a

140
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:56,399
parasite we have example here leeches on

141
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:59,939
a fish parasite a true predator here we

142
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,939
have the Lions consuming their food prey

143
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:04,680
they're actually killing it completely

144
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:07,889
yes in this case a predator or parasite

145
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,408
i'm parasitism is much smaller here's

146
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,900
about equal size the prison messes I

147
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:14,250
need to die a case of us we may not

148
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,228
necessarily die from mosquito bite

149
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,899
assume those are carrying any harmful

150
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:20,370
diseases leeches do not want to kill

151
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:24,329
their hosts but in some cases they do

152
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,819
but it's not necessary for them we have

153
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:30,120
two different types of parasites there's

154
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:32,009
external parasites such as we call those

155
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,649
ectoparasites and they feed on the

156
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:36,870
exterior surface or an organism prime

157
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:38,158
example would be a tick and we have

158
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,470
different types of ticks but they all

159
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:42,810
are ectoparasites

160
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,720
we're feeding on the surface of your

161
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,810
skin parasitoids our insects or lofts

162
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,840
that lay eggs on living hosts we hear

163
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,780
homeroom that meets aliens our hormone

164
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:56,659
hornworm here that feeds on tomatoes is

165
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:00,059
getting attacked here here's our

166
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,430
parasitic wasp attacking 1/8 it these

167
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,310
are examples of parasites and

168
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:08,970
parasitoids and ectoparasites living

169
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,410
purely on the surface of the organism in

170
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,140
contrast to that there's something

171
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,450
called endo parasites and these live

172
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,579
within the bodies of vertebrates and

173
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:20,430
invertebrates marked by much more

174
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:22,680
extreme specialization than external

175
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,600
parasites due to parasite specifically

176
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,420
can live inside doing your specific body

177
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,550
system as an example here these are

178
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,509
endoparasites living within the bodies

179
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:36,150
inside and no meaning in brood parasites

180
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:39,629
are birds an example laying eggs in the

181
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:40,649
nest of other species so the cowbird and

182
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,449
its Eastern Phoebe

183
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:45,750
these aren't phoebe eggs are all this

184
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:48,360
nice kind of like almost pinkish tannish

185
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:52,829
color and then we have the cowbird this

186
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,350
speckled egg what happens here is the

187
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:58,649
Phoebe species creates a nest place it

188
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:02,970
takes in it and this cow bird this brood

189
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:05,209
parasite comes in lays one egg with any

190
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,710
other eggs of this other bird species

191
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:10,379
this poor Phoebe then takes care of all

192
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:12,089
the eggs raising all the young and isn't

193
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:13,918
inverting hidden care of this other

194
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:16,259
species this caliber this parasite

195
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,479
species that basically didn't build the

196
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,789
nest doesn't feed the young comes in

197
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,730
laying and then leaves this example

198
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:27,660
again parasite one organisms benefiting

199
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:29,009
one is clearly not comunism

200
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,620
is a symbiotic relationship that

201
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:34,200
benefits one species but neither harms

202
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,719
nor benefits the other coefficient sea

203
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,250
anemones are the prime example clownfish

204
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,450
gained protection by remaining among the

205
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,519
enemy's tentacles

206
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,910
their stinging tentacles to most other

207
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,699
species they also are green scraps from

208
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:49,529
the enemies food but the enemies really

209
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,629
not getting much of a benefit in this

210
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,549
case the clownfish is getting a benefit

211
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:54,100
but it's not like the accomplishes

212
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:57,008
feeding on

213
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,610
it's not reducing its ability to survive

214
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:00,789
at all

215
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:03,789
but there's no benefit for it other

216
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:06,549
examples would be cow I'm sorry cattle

217
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:09,399
egrets in the African cape buffalo this

218
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:11,019
species here the egrets of the birds may

219
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,860
eat insects off the Buffalo see them

220
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:16,929
located here here's one back here a

221
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,610
couple here on the hippo they're eating

222
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:22,289
the insects but there's no clear

223
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:25,589
distinction between communism and mutual

224
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:27,969
mutualism remember communalism is

225
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:30,339
reiationship that benefits one but

226
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,440
neither harms never the benefits the

227
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,300
other it's difficult to determine

228
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,790
determine if the second partner benefits

229
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:40,299
at all in this case indeed relationships

230
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:41,828
may sometimes parasitic but in this case

231
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:44,818
the insects that the egrets eating

232
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:47,559
really not doing any harm to the cape

233
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:51,159
buffalo here but really not often to

234
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:53,469
benefit by removing them printed or prey

235
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,689
interactions this predation is a

236
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,600
consuming of one organism by another

237
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,939
this is a clear distinction here the

238
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,939
predator prey predation is conceding

239
00:10:00,938 --> 00:10:08,230
that other animal here here we have the

240
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:10,929
praying mantis in the fly we have a bird

241
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,610
here eating a fish again it's going to

242
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:14,409
be it's one way the poor fish isn't a

243
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,180
survive and that poor flies not going to

244
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:18,578
survive this is a great blue herring

245
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:20,049
eating a sunfish in particular under

246
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:22,739
simple laboratory conditions

247
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:25,149
predation often exterminates the prey

248
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,698
then it becomes extinct itself because

249
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:29,649
it runs out of food so if these great

250
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:31,299
blue herring ate all the sunfish they

251
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:32,698
themselves would become extinct because

252
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:35,490
they eliminate their own food source

253
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:38,828
typically this doesn't happen in nature

254
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:42,129
what tends to happen in nature is the

255
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:46,870
example here we have of our North

256
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:49,419
American snowshoe hare a rabbit and we

257
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,159
have the Lynx that feeds on it the preys

258
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:53,679
the rabbit you notice as the rabbit

259
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,899
population increases there's a slight

260
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,549
delay but in the Lynx population

261
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:59,198
increasing and that will drop as the

262
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:01,528
rabbit population drops and it kind of

263
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:04,120
goes through this cycle the rabbits

264
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:06,429
population depends on the presence of

265
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,389
what it eats in this case it's a willow

266
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,549
or birch branch

267
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:11,830
is the Lynx is dependent on the presence

268
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:14,289
of the actual rabbit you can see it's

269
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,379
this transition that's occurring hi in

270
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:18,939
one case followed by peak here in the

271
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:21,960
predator-prey drops predator drops so on

272
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,670
and so forth this interaction occurs

273
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,730
this predator prey interactions hers

274
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:29,769
something called keystone species so

275
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,539
these interactions are essential for the

276
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:34,299
maintenance of species diversity in

277
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:36,339
communities the Predators can be greatly

278
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:38,229
reduced competition competitive

279
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,290
exclusion by reducing the individuals

280
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,789
for competing species so how does this

281
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:45,459
look at us in a real example

282
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:50,349
well keystone species here we have

283
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:53,620
feeding on kelp so we have our kelp

284
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:57,040
forests that exist and an enemies here

285
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,580
these sea stars are bivalves and they're

286
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,559
downing the habitats here they are the

287
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,060
feet on the kelp so when there's only a

288
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,219
couple then the kelp was able to grow

289
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:08,799
there's able to these protective forests

290
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,509
and everything is well I'm good however

291
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,329
when you take out the key species here

292
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:15,879
the one that's eating these particular

293
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,940
sea stars now we get a plethora of sea

294
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:21,909
stars our kelp basically goes down to

295
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,890
almost nothing now as a result we don't

296
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:25,779
have this protective kelp forest to

297
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:28,509
allow fish species to occur to protect

298
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:31,029
them for other bigger fish so this

299
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:33,100
keystone species is a very important

300
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:36,519
species that can vastly affect the

301
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:40,360
ecosystem keystone where gets his name

302
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:42,100
from is the cue stone in a archway the

303
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,470
stringers are the stones here that

304
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,120
keystone is that Center one another

305
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,370
example the keystone species would be a

306
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,129
beaver they treat these beaver dams and

307
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,190
help can block up rivers if you know of

308
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:55,570
any people that live near these ways

309
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,160
beavers are very persistent in putting

310
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,020
up these beaver dams that can really

311
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:00,669
change an ecosystem

312
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:02,620
therefore these beavers would be a

313
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:04,719
keystone species because they vastly

314
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,350
impact the environment around them

315
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,920
looking at this beaver I don't know if I

316
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,779
trust him 100% he looks like he's up to

317
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,909
no good

318
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:18,360
still he's a keystone species and can

319
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:20,419
vastly affect the environment

320
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,629
physically here by building

321
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:24,979
damn and he may also be able to affect

322
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:27,730
it intellectually because it looks like

323
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,730
he's plotting something
