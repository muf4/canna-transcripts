1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
okay here we can see a plant that's been

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:05,878
uh potted or transplanted several times

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,830
we can see the original plug that it

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,649
started in then the larger container it

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,039
went to and its current container so all

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,230
of these stages help kind of maximize

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,329
the space that a grower can grow plants

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,160
in minimize the amount of lights and

9
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,669
help the efficiency value of the plant

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,929
but the upper of the growing operation

11
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,368
transplanting oftentimes plants will be

12
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,439
translated during the vegetative phase

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,379
to encourage top growth and also to

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,359
maximize a growing space the amount of

15
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,030
times that this is done is transplanting

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,460
action in what size containers that are

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,890
selected are mainly grower dependent

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,350
there's no set gallon amount or size

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,480
enough that you must go to overall of

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,850
course the trend is increasing but what

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,299
size use as maximum is slightly grower

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,698
dependent most using seven or ten gallon

23
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:58,349
pots for their larger size some as small

24
00:00:53,698 --> 00:01:00,000
as five and some as large as 15 one of

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,280
the mindfully near transplanting also

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,808
want to harden off your transplants if

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,849
you are transplanting changing the

28
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,469
lighting at the same time be sure a lot

29
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,390
of time for the plants to transition to

30
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,579
reduce the chance of damaging those

31
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,680
plants want to be careful and mindful of

32
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,170
leaf burn because this can be a sign

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,080
that you're pushing that growth on that

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,180
kind of ragged edge they're really doing

35
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,769
severe damage to the plants while you're

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,420
trying to help them out with the

37
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:25,978
transplant phase this can be

38
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,019
accomplished by sometimes taking lights

39
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:29,728
and hang them further away to reduce the

40
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,019
intensity which is great for growers

41
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:33,959
because it can also increase the

42
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:37,039
lighting footprint during the vegetative

43
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,039
stage of growth
