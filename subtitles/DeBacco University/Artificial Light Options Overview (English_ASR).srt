1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
this is gonna be a very brief overview

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,989
of the artificial lighting options and I

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,750
see a bunch of them here in this veg

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,679
room and dis identifying which ones that

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:16,350
they are and what their main purpose is

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:19,589
so the types of lighting options are the

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,330
best uses here provided so there's nope

8
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,539
in the picture here of fluorescence but

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,549
T fives are high energy if efficient and

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,279
they're typically used for clones or

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,070
seedlings for hid the high-intensity

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:35,070
output lights metal halide lights are

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,630
typically used for veg the veg phase

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,359
even though they're not pictured here

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,600
CMH is our ceramic metal halides our

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:45,869
propagation into veg this is one example

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,000
here should be a CMH light high pressure

18
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:50,599
sodium is used for flowering and anna

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,488
has that kind of yellowish tint to it

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,429
lepo light emitting plasma is veg or

21
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:59,399
used as flowers and supplementation also

22
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:03,448
produces a very white almost slightly

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,700
bluish light here and then LEDs can be

24
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:07,920
our light-emitting diodes and this can

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,719
be for the full grow cycle this one's

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,969
not necessarily a full spectrum is kind

27
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,069
of purple and pink light on there some

28
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:15,629
that will produce a very clean white

29
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,809
light and those used for a full spectrum

30
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:21,929
so just this gives you that quick little

31
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,850
comparison of how these different lights

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,200
look some of the different colors that

33
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,329
they can produce and how you can easily

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,359
identify them one potentially by their

35
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:34,280
structure or two by the color at least

36
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,280
that we perceive that light to produce
