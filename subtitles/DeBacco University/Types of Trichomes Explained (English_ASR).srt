1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,000
many growers when they're looking at

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,120
determining the peak harvest of their

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,040
cannabis plants

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,919
we'll look at the trichomes a lot of

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,599
growers when they're looking at the

6
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,039
trichomes notice there's more than just

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,120
one type of trichome

8
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,638
well this video here will explain the

9
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:15,119
different types of trichomes that you

10
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,919
might be

11
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,919
visually seeing

12
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,760
[Music]

13
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,079
all right let's get into types of

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,279
trichomes explained here we can see them

15
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,799
visually represented

16
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,640
we're going to go into them in a little

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
bit more detail

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,759
so first off what is a trichome well

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
trichomes are small

20
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,079
hair or other outgrowth of the epidermis

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,239
of the plant typically unicellular

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,000
and can be glandular these structures

23
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,359
are the site of cannabinoid terpene and

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,439
flavinoid production

25
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,200
and this is why growers look at them and

26
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,679
think that they're so important because

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,359
really

28
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,600
that's where all of the chemicals that

29
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,799
they're looking for are being produced

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
these are found in more than just

31
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,399
cannabis plants so keep that in mind as

32
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,119
terpenes function as a natural plant

33
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,359
defense

34
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,198
mechanism in other plants as well here

35
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,840
we're seeing some of the kind of

36
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,200
visual representation of them some you

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,880
might be more familiar with

38
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
some maybe just think these little

39
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,478
background structures but they're all

40
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,040
kind of a protrusion

41
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,000
of that epidermis now we have the

42
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,520
glandular

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,560
trichomes here and there's again there's

44
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,079
going to be a whole bunch of different

45
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,400
types i'm going to try to present some

46
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,719
good

47
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
visual images as well as some

48
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,359
descriptions here

49
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,118
so glandular trichomes are going to be

50
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,000
kind of in this category and they

51
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,959
produce and store

52
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,319
large amounts of cannabis resin which

53
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,640
are found in high quantities

54
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,559
in female flowers but are also found in

55
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,879
leaves and also on the stems

56
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,079
of particularly younger plants so that

57
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,438
is only found there

58
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,000
they can be found in other portions of

59
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,559
the plant as well glandular trichomes

60
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,280
can occur

61
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
as small bulbous trichomes with one cell

62
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,118
cell stocks

63
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,000
cecil glands which are attached directly

64
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,840
at the base

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,920
without a stock or multi-cellular

66
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,320
stocked granular trichomes with

67
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,879
long multicellular stalks into the

68
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,118
brachials surrounding the pistol flowers

69
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,798
what does that mean if you look with a

70
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,519
strong magnifying loop

71
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,439
kind of towards the area of the flower

72
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,199
or in fluorescence that's unfertilized

73
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,759
you might be finding these different

74
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,000
structures here there are three common

75
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,079
glandular trichomes here as we can see

76
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,520
listed and we'll go through each of

77
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,560
those and show you kind of a good

78
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,480
picture

79
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,800
of each so you can identify those

80
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,439
different glandular trichomes are all in

81
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,680
that same

82
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,479
category so starting with the first one

83
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,719
the bulbous

84
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,639
trichomes here and these bubbles

85
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,000
trichomes are found throughout the plant

86
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,159
but do not produce or contain

87
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,800
cannabinoid or terpenes

88
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,439
they're very small 15 and 30 microns in

89
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,959
size

90
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,800
so they are that kind of that little bit

91
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,959
of that kind of like bulb

92
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,239
like look to them and found throughout

93
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,400
the plants not just in one

94
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,439
area but do not really contain any

95
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
cannabinoids or

96
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,959
terpenes so not really a main focus to

97
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
determining

98
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,000
the peak of harvest or how well your

99
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,319
harvest may go

100
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,280
then we have the capitae sizzle

101
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,799
trichomes

102
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,000
so in this example here these have

103
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,159
globular shaped head here and are the

104
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,840
most common as are found on the stems

105
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,158
leaves and also the bracts so they're

106
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,360
found in multiple locations in the plant

107
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,359
while these trichomes do produce

108
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,640
cannabinoids the levels produce are much

109
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,599
lower than the capitis stocked trichomes

110
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,079
which are discussed

111
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,399
on the next slide these are mid-sized

112
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,519
measuring from 15 to 100 microns across

113
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,799
so they're a little bit bigger than the

114
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,959
first ones

115
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,760
but really produce cannabinoids but not

116
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,439
really to any great degree

117
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,120
so these are the kind of the highlight

118
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,919
ones i think the ones that most growers

119
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,319
are kind of seeking out and looking for

120
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,318
these are the capitated stocked

121
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,039
trichomes and they are the primary

122
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,759
source

123
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,239
of the cannabinoids terpenes other plant

124
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,158
oils

125
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,158
found in cannabis plants that develop

126
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,439
only after flower formation

127
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,280
so these are the kind of the key ones

128
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,799
that we're looking for humans that we're

129
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
going to be looking at as far as

130
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,719
determining peak harvest

131
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,319
going from that clear to that cloudy to

132
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,039
go a little bit beyond maybe the amber

133
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,958
state

134
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,079
if you look at the bracks of the flower

135
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,799
there are small

136
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,239
tiny mushrooms that measure about 150 to

137
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,879
500 microns tall

138
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,840
so in relative comparison much taller

139
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,359
than the other ones

140
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,238
so it makes it great for kind of that

141
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,759
visualness to kind of like zooming in on

142
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,959
now we also have some non-glandular

143
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,680
trichomes which are the ones that be

144
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,000
located

145
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,840
uh here as far as structures go there

146
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,399
are hair-like extensions resembling leaf

147
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,359
hairs

148
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,198
with slender kind of pointed apex they

149
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,879
protect the plant from its environment

150
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,478
mainly through physical means

151
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,240
restricting access to animals and

152
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,399
insects preventing water loss or

153
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,519
light degradation and fungal infection

154
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,839
so they do have

155
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,519
important plant functions it's

156
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,839
characteristic on cannabis to find

157
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,240
non-glandular trichomes on both the top

158
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,198
and also the bottom of the leaves and

159
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,040
there's two main

160
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,199
non-glandular trichomes found on

161
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,520
cannabis plants

162
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,720
so first off here so here we have the

163
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,319
systolith trichomes that have

164
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,919
characterized bear claw shape

165
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,719
and have calcium systolic resembling

166
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,359
knobs

167
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,639
visual at their base kind of see them

168
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
located right

169
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,319
here they're looking really in detail

170
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,199
they're found on the upper surface of

171
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,800
the leaves and range from 150 to 220

172
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,319
microns in height frequently these

173
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,240
trichomes are broken at the

174
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,439
knob feet so they can be broken right

175
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,439
right there at that kind of

176
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,719
area we see three represented or

177
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,560
highlighted

178
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,479
in this labeled diagram right here

179
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,839
and we have the non the systolic

180
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,478
trichomes as well

181
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,279
and these are found most often on the

182
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,439
lower side

183
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,559
of the leaves bracks and brachials and

184
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,959
tend to be fine

185
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
and slender shaped there so here's

186
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,198
basically there's no like bulb at the

187
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,319
bottom

188
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,879
they're just kind of that looks like a

189
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,439
little clear hair protrusion

190
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,879
from the leaf surface there remember

191
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,800
these are all epidermal kind of

192
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,319
protrusions there that are occurring

193
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,680
so hopefully this was a nice kind of

194
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,399
breakdown of looking at the different

195
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,918
trichomes

196
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,599
so if you're looking at the leaf surface

197
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,519
looking at the flowers you can have a

198
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,400
better understanding for the diversity

199
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,639
of trichomes

200
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,638
that are present on a cannabis plant
