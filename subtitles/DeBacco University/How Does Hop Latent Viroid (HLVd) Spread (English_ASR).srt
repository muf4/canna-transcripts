1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,080
and this debaco University video we're

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,000
going to go over how does hoplate and

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,560
thyroid spread which is important for

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,379
any grower to understand we're looking

5
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,939
at prevention uh in a way to combat a

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,360
potential issue in your growing

7
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:14,359
operation

8
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:21,879
[Music]

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,199
so there's a lot of concern over hoplate

10
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:26,640
and virate well here we're going to

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,260
learn about how does it go about

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,899
spreading

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,859
first off a great presentation I'm here

14
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:37,140
took some screenshots from this by Dr

15
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:39,600
zamir apunja welcome to check out his

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,239
presentation here at can mid 23 as well

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,039
as others information provided in the

18
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,779
description link

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,700
so how does high blood and thyroids

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,460
spread well mechanical damage such as

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,820
trimming the sap contact is actually

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,558
what is causing that viroid to be

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,000
transmitted so that results in the

24
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,299
grower being the most common Vector

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,039
insect vectors are possible but at this

26
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:05,099
time they're not really well understood

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,780
so if you grow our trimming from one

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,000
plant move to another plant you've kind

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,180
of just inoculated or infected the next

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,040
Plant sadly also in addition to trimming

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,080
the above portions of the plant root

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,060
contact and this could be root contact

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,060
physically with the roots or water

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,340
curing that from the roots of one plant

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,000
to another this is where the thyroid

36
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,820
load is actually very high and early on

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,159
as I'll talk about in a moment seeds are

38
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:35,339
not the potential way or method of

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,020
transmission this hop latent thyroid

40
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,880
so potential roots of transmission as I

41
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,560
said about the water I can go through

42
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,319
the water so flood and drain systems

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,299
dwc's deep water cultures clone trays

44
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,279
flood and drain really any operation

45
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,020
that recirculates water this is of

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,599
concern it can also reside in the

47
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:55,859
irrigation tubes the growing substrate

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,379
as well as the root all areas potential

49
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,759
of transmission this is why or how it

50
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,578
can spread so quickly through an area

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,959
it's also a very stable viral Aid and it

52
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:05,879
can survive in water for up to seven

53
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,359
days about a week and that can help

54
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,859
speed its infection of many plants in a

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,780
growing operation

56
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,860
now this phloem Trends transmitted so

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,659
not to get too much into the biology

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,819
aspect but entry into the flowment is

59
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,159
what allow us to move up as well as down

60
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:22,919
the plants in contrast xylem is mainly

61
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,500
roots to shoots or bottom to top phloem

62
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,539
can go basically any direction uh floam

63
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,919
Falls the sugars and it does translocate

64
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:31,859
through the entire plant or at least

65
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:34,378
environment via this root in about six

66
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,540
weeks time so very quickly

67
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,818
an experiment provided here some of the

68
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:40,500
data they made a stem cut they did an

69
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,899
artificial transmission of hot plate and

70
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,300
thyroid to exposed stem Cuts as we can

71
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,219
see right here the Violet was inoculated

72
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,319
at the wound site in two weeks post

73
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,560
inoculation it could be detected already

74
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:56,039
in the roots of the plant as well as the

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,959
upper stem portions of the plant four to

76
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,120
six weeks post infection the entire

77
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,098
plant becomes infected so it's kind of

78
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,239
has a little bit of this unique jumping

79
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,639
right it doesn't just start in one point

80
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,920
and just radiate out it actually goes to

81
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,719
specific portions of the plant they've

82
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,818
outlined that here where it was found in

83
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,459
we're seeing points of inoculation found

84
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:16,439
the roots in two weeks in Youngs in four

85
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,239
weeks and then the rest of the plant in

86
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,060
six weeks so what was interesting about

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,640
this path of infection is it is you know

88
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,080
stem top inoculated The Roots were

89
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,000
actually the first point where it

90
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,000
reached detectable levels

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,620
than other top growing tips and then the

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,019
lower leaves or branches became positive

93
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,019
properly and virate in that order and

94
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,280
that two to six week time frame so it's

95
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,039
important we're looking at potentially

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,900
taking samples Roots may be a good area

97
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,239
to sample

98
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,920
uh this kind of shows another visual the

99
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,599
virus travels down first to the roots

100
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,699
indicating that it is phloem transmitted

101
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:53,158
and then spread to the apical meristem

102
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,139
followed by the full plant infection so

103
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:56,459
there's a point of infection two weeks

104
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:58,139
later right down to the roots

105
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,759
accumulates down there then after

106
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,439
accumulates down there then it goes back

107
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,419
and kind of shows up at the very top of

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,519
the plant and then six weeks later then

109
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,518
it's well distributed amongst the entire

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,620
plant so keep that in mind

111
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,900
the flowering can also increase the

112
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,920
thyroid load the stress of flowering can

113
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,599
increase the amount of area that's

114
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,339
present in the plant this shows the

115
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,159
importance of testing a plant multiple

116
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,078
times as early veg it could be below

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,820
detectable levels you could have that

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,040
virus it could be very low that really

119
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:28,199
stress not really proliferating

120
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,360
testing and veg is still important as if

121
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,460
a positive is found in veg that plant

122
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,620
should be removed immediately and but

123
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:37,680
just because it tested negative in early

124
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,660
veg following up with another test

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,699
during flowering would be advised to

126
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,560
ensure that that small potential small

127
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,500
viral load then when it becomes much

128
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,199
larger the easier to finally identify

129
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,120
would be worth a second test there

130
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,340
now as I said water transmitted which is

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,139
again a little bit scary this is in part

132
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,359
how it can travel so fast for a growing

133
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,220
operation plants are not even have to

134
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
come into direct contact with one

135
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,320
another can spread infections via water

136
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,540
transfer contact any recycling water is

137
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,459
uh is at risk with two common methods

138
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,439
occur where the cloner tray transferred

139
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,939
only on water we could see here where

140
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:13,439
there's a physical separation between

141
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:16,199
these plants but there's a water

142
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,699
connection and that allows that healthy

143
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,740
plant to become infected from that

144
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,840
unhealthy plant and flood and drain

145
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,400
growing as well you can also see in the

146
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,379
cloner where the virus detected two

147
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,719
weeks of exposure of healthy roots in a

148
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,759
solution containing infected Roots there

149
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,259
was no physical root contact but clearly

150
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,479
we could see that it is able to

151
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,819
basically go through that water and take

152
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,620
down healthy plants also on a tray where

153
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,659
they're physically separated water going

154
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,000
between the two not far it goes from one

155
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,000
to the other

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,399
also infected mother plants so since the

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,259
thyroid is systemic to the plant cloning

158
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,060
the plant will produce many infected

159
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,979
Offspring so it's not advised you take

160
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,379
cuttings or clippings from an infected

161
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,659
mother plant this is also why testing

162
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,879
and re-testing mother plants is so

163
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,020
important all cuttings picture tested

164
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,759
positive for highly environment

165
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,258
infection so if you get a mother it's

166
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,000
positive you want to remove that mother

167
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,560
and do not take any clones from that

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
you'll just be spreading the infection

169
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,280
even faster

170
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,160
now seed transmission gets a little

171
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,559
confusing on here I mean showed that

172
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,479
when female plants are infected this can

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,519
increase the odds or the percentages of

174
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,199
the seeds that are infected most of the

175
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,180
hot plate and thyroid found is on the

176
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,280
outside of the seed coat 10 to 15

177
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,079
infection can still be found on the

178
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,559
inside of the seeds

179
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,719
if the seedling typical catalyden has

180
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,280
any physical damage the hoplit

181
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,319
environment can easily enter the plant

182
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,758
from the seed coat should be a prime

183
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,800
example here that seedling is kind of

184
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,120
coming out and unfurling that seed coat

185
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,520
might still be attached you get a little

186
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,139
physical abrasion well that operate is

187
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,418
right in the on the seed coat you can

188
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,978
easily now get into this very young

189
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:51,659
plant

190
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:53,099
it's also present in dry flowers and

191
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,479
it's not just the super young plants it

192
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,259
can also be the fully mature and

193
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:59,879
harvested dry flour 40 sampled from

194
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,400
dispensaries do show positive for hot

195
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,860
plate and thyroid now this was study was

196
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,500
done in California I believe which shows

197
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,360
how widespread it actually is it's also

198
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,160
found in male flowers so it's another

199
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,960
reason for concern that just because

200
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,600
only only using it for breeding purposes

201
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,638
you don't want to have any male flowers

202
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,560
or male plants that have the hotline

203
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,660
environment as well

204
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,280
glove transmitted so it survives on sap

205
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,919
on gloves up to five days at room

206
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,839
temperature showing how very stable it

207
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,719
is so when you're discarding your gloves

208
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,879
after trimming discard them in a trash

209
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,919
can and leave them there and get that

210
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,019
out and removed from any part of the

211
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,719
groin area it's that stable can survive

212
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:42,359
for five days even at warm temperatures

213
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,580
would be considered room temperature

214
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,439
leave transfer can survive for four

215
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,240
weeks so be sure to clean remove leaves

216
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,800
that are being trimmed this is why it's

217
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,780
important for your gloves to be disposed

218
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,120
of and physically removed as well as

219
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,279
leaves survival and dried leaves tested

220
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,899
one two three and four weeks later Forex

221
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,519
is still getting positive there so it

222
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:01,500
just shows you the stability of hoplate

223
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,899
and fibroid and how easily it can

224
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,639
transfer from material that Growers

225
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:07,439
might be not worried about or not

226
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,360
thinking about it can really do any harm

227
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,098
to their operation

228
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,080
that root tissue ever important root

229
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:14,699
tissue it's very stable thyroid heating

230
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,098
it to 70 degrees Celsius which is about

231
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:20,160
158 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes

232
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:22,740
did not destroy the RNA that RNA is kind

233
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,620
of looped over itself very very stable

234
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,439
has a very longevity in The Roots

235
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,978
um you know it just speaks to the you

236
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:34,860
know reason why it's probably becomes so

237
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:37,740
prevalent in the growing world right now

238
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,599
because it's so stable that it's able to

239
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,459
transfer very easily and once it gets

240
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,839
kind of established it's very hard to

241
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,759
get rid of

242
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,440
now those male flowers that I mentioned

243
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,939
at this time there's no real evidence

244
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,160
that hopefully very can be present in

245
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,000
the pollen but it can be present in the

246
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:56,100
male flower structure it can be found in

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,559
the male flowers as well as in the

248
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,120
anthers but unconfirmed in pollen and no

249
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,639
evidence of transmission yet that

250
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,379
statement doesn't happen but this at

251
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,899
least not right now apparently obvious

252
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,458
that it does but again another reason

253
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,720
for concerns even in breeding if you're

254
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,939
like I'm not going to wear that plant to

255
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,740
you know for to produce flowers for

256
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,080
dried flour I'm only breeding with it

257
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,940
still reason for concern still a reason

258
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,220
to remove that plant from your operation

259
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,360
hopefully if you do see overall of

260
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,360
thyroid load
