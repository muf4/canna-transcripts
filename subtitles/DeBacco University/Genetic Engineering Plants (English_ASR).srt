1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,129
so in this video we're gonna relate

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,429
genetic engineering to plants typically

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:11,070
grown in a lab controlled conditions you

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,460
see growth chambers here little sterile

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,589
conditions in these little jars and

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,469
we're gonna relate this how we're able

7
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:21,000
to change genes relate to plants have

8
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,399
another one on medicine we looked at

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,890
vaccines you're looking at food we may

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,509
eat so transgenic plants such as corn

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,449
cotton soybeans and many others there's

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,969
pros and cons different ways we can

13
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,420
genetically modified plants one example

14
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,520
here and it provide the the source where

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,219
we're looking at Roundup Ready soybean

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,250
yield so Roundup Ready means these Swee

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,129
beans are resistant to the herbicide

18
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,238
roundup that you might be familiar with

19
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:51,149
here's the control and here's the

20
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,359
treated so yield and bushels per acre

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,829
Sierra control again yield is referring

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,079
to how many soybeans are getting off the

23
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,660
field here's the treated you noticing it

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,539
dramatic increase so improved yield on

25
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,429
Roundup Ready soybeans so four point

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,640
three bushel average increase per acre

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,340
average of 14 treatment locations across

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,629
different states and into Canada a

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,030
corporator of this roundup which is the

30
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,849
active ingredient glyphosate is the

31
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,960
what's roundup is basically what that is

32
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:27,688
and by having soybeans that aren't

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,658
affected by roundup glyphosate being the

34
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:32,429
herbicide farmers are able to go through

35
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,530
and sprayed the field control the weeds

36
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,729
and not kill their crop and that's

37
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,478
what's causing the increase in yield

38
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:40,938
here seen in 2009 so conventional

39
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,019
compared to Janice modified well

40
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:45,629
conventional corn you can upfront bill

41
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,328
Inc down here no real benefits detected

42
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:49,890
versus genetically modified corn

43
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:51,658
requires 6 percent less pesticides to

44
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,840
produce enough calories to feed 88

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,820
million people per year higher yield

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,520
seven point six percent in this study

47
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:03,328
increased farmer income overall across

48
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,849
all farmers from 1996 to 2007 estimated

49
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:08,639
over forty four billion dollars so you

50
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:10,439
could see here there's some advantages

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,519
and pressures to switch over to

52
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,930
genetically modified corn

53
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,350
but there are potential risks which

54
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,640
outside your abbreviated GM promise of

55
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:20,620
genetic engineering is very much evident

56
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:24,549
however its generates some considerable

57
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:29,650
controversy and protests our genetic

58
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:31,960
inheritance within genes there's been

59
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:35,319
rallies that say no GMOs very much

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,480
against modified whether you're for or

61
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,930
against a corn production and yield per

62
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:43,569
acre has dramatically increased we need

63
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,540
to feed the world here so that's one of

64
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:49,569
the pressures to to this increasing of

65
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:53,620
yield and GM crops are one way that's

66
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:55,750
showing to continue this increase Oscar

67
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,430
Golden Rice example is another form of

68
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,020
genetically modified it's a variety of

69
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,879
rice that was genetically engineered to

70
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,340
produce beta carotene which is a

71
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,990
precursor to vitamin A here's the world

72
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,120
where there's a shortage of vitamin A in

73
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,980
the diet this genetically modified rice

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,080
and has this kind of golden like color

75
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:13,329
to it is a great plant because its

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,370
whites reduce over the world as a main

77
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,920
food crop so instead of growing this

78
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,700
traditional rice by simply growing this

79
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,659
golden rice behaves in the same way

80
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,159
individuals are able to get this

81
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,590
precursor to vitamin A and its beta

82
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,020
carotene can really save a lot of people

83
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,180
a lot of lives without really causing

84
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:35,350
any change to simply starting with

85
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,849
different seeds I've to comment rate so

86
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,129
for genetically modified at least used

87
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,729
on the large scale here across the

88
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:43,030
United States

89
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:45,310
our herbicide resistance is one and it's

90
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,439
often refrigerant Roundup Ready amount

91
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,530
of ready corn soybeans alfalfa and oil

92
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,959
cotton it simply means that roundup when

93
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,590
applied to most plants causes anodizing

94
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,750
herbicide

95
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,500
however these genetically modified

96
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:03,280
plants have this protein that's able to

97
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,629
basically break down and not suffer the

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,459
effects of roundup

99
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:08,620
so gently modifies the ants are

100
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,349
resistant to this weed killer what this

101
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,409
allows occur is the plant that has that

102
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:16,149
particular gene to survive and all of

103
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,589
the regular crops and weeds and any

104
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:20,769
other plants in the vicinity of that

105
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:24,129
chosen crop dies allowing the main crop

106
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:26,979
to be able to survive so

107
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:29,110
and farmers enough to plow the fields it

108
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,300
sistex a lot of input lot IDs a lot of

109
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,090
energy a lot of time dustbowl

110
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,300
illumination back in the turn of century

111
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:39,639
this is actual images of topsoil that

112
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,350
got picked up by the wind and carry

113
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,180
these large clouds of dust it occurred

114
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,010
because farmers plowed their few fields

115
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,959
the appositive fields to reduce the weed

116
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,129
pressure well with herbicide resistance

117
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,079
they don't have to worry about that

118
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:52,029
as a result improving yields and

119
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,620
resulting in cleaner fields because of

120
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:55,509
the lack of weeds without going through

121
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,050
the plowing and have a risk of losing

122
00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:01,509
very valuable topsoil on some

123
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,329
disadvantage though herbicide resistance

124
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:07,689
like anything you use any chemical over

125
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:09,639
a period of time plants animals are

126
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:12,370
going to develop resistance to that it's

127
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,560
not gonna be as effective and because

128
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,959
only certain crops are resistant to that

129
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,689
herbicide the concept of mono cropping

130
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,339
occurs you can only grow or only that

131
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:23,709
one particular crop with that one

132
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,789
particular gene is gonna survive as a

133
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,219
result you're gonna have a bunch of

134
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,450
essentially potentially clones or at

135
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,480
least ones that are very genetically

136
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:33,279
similar grown you can't grow carrots and

137
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,830
peas and soybeans in the same field

138
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,669
could only grow genetically modified

139
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:41,740
ones that are resistant to the herbicide

140
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:44,020
the idea of super weeds myself are on

141
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,800
this side super weeds where we're

142
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:49,839
applying these herbicides and the whole

143
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,610
resistance develops so we have another

144
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,869
herbicide different chemistry

145
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,490
well it resistant so that would apply

146
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,410
another one apply another one these

147
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,449
super weeds may become resistant

148
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,550
eventually to all the herbicides that we

149
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:03,899
currently have so that's another concern

150
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:07,480
potential disadvantage that could occur

151
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:11,019
another modification that's being added

152
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,400
to plants is insect resistance BT beauty

153
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,649
and satyrs it's called Bacillus

154
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,750
thuringiensis what this does is it

155
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:18,699
breaks down and kills caterpillars

156
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,860
it's a protein produced by solar

157
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:23,229
bacteria and harmful to pests such as

158
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,389
caterpillars but not humans it's been

159
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,210
introduced into tomato plants and many

160
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,709
others corns another example here we see

161
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:31,719
feeding that's occurring on a plant that

162
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:33,849
did not have the gene here's our Jena

163
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,780
the modified one and we see very minimal

164
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,780
feeding that has occurred

165
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,180
for their traits for a percent of

166
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,939
resistance as one as I mentioned insect

167
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,620
resistance is another and putting them

168
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,389
both together in the same plant it's

169
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,000
another one that's getting popularity

170
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:52,029
herbicide tolerance you see increasing

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,350
dramatically insect resistance also but

172
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:55,479
now we're seeing the rise of the

173
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:59,740
combination of the two putting two

174
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:03,310
traits into one plant these concerns for

175
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,720
risks with these GM crops are GM foods

176
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,030
safe for the environment well other

177
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,350
organisms be harmed unintentionally will

178
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,929
pass become resistant to these

179
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,600
pesticides what the introduced genes are

180
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,910
passed from the GM crop to wild or weedy

181
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,670
relatives these are all concerns with

182
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,560
these crops one of the other issues is

183
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:23,350
that we have this ever increasing world

184
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,290
population so we need to produce more

185
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,750
food if we have a way of modifying crops

186
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,030
to be able to meet that demand that will

187
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,279
allow the population to increase but

188
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:34,889
there's also potential for other risks

189
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,149
that may be occurring with that

190
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:40,209
starvation with the other flip side of

191
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:43,449
that coin so insect resistance again at

192
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:45,639
bacillus thuringiensis at Pt advantages

193
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,649
to this are that don't have to fight

194
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,110
insecticides of the crop no one wants to

195
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:52,659
buy a corn it's got the tip basically

196
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,980
eaten out by an insect reduces trips in

197
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,810
the field farmers don't have to drive

198
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,430
over all these fields and these are very

199
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:02,079
large fields in some cases early insects

200
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,310
can be easily controlled that first

201
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,449
flush of insects can be controlled

202
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:11,230
because the crop already has a built-in

203
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:12,959
insecticide with it however the cons are

204
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,240
i pianets integrated pest management

205
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,699
that isn't managing the pests

206
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,829
effectively year to year here we're just

207
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,509
putting the pesticide in the field in

208
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:24,359
the plant that's really kind of going

209
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:26,379
against the whole IPM practice

210
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,900
insecticide resistance we can get

211
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,829
insects that could be resistant and

212
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,870
non-target insects could also be

213
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:34,179
affected here's resistance of different

214
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,250
chemistry of insecticides we see the

215
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,859
resistance increasing much as we saw

216
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,070
with the herbicide resistant now here we

217
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,830
have ideally if the entire field was

218
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,890
applied and grown as with those insect

219
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,780
resistant genes when it's the increase

220
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,679
of developing or selecting for

221
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,610
individuals

222
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:57,219
resistant becomes very high what farmers

223
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:01,690
should be doing his alkane part of the

224
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,700
field that simply does not have GM crops

225
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,089
what that does that keeps some insects

226
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,670
alive that are susceptible to that

227
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:12,730
particular herbicide or that particular

228
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:15,419
in this case insecticide that allows us

229
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,950
to be mixed in the population and

230
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,778
increases the odds that they'll be

231
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,980
susceptible genes in the environment

232
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:23,769
through our punnett square crosses

233
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,440
reducing the overall pressure the hard

234
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:27,939
part is if farmers grow a large scale or

235
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,640
killing a blue mass the vast majority

236
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:33,010
off we can be selecting for this

237
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:37,299
increase in insecticide resistance at a

238
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:38,649
faster rate non-target insects corn

239
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:41,019
borers killed those are the ones that go

240
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,940
into the very tips of the corn but the

241
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,429
pollen that washes into streams may kill

242
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,350
the non target caddisfly the cash fly

243
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:50,019
looks like it's present in freshwater

244
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,089
streams eaten by a lot of trout and fish

245
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:55,720
and aquatic organisms this could be a

246
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:59,560
potential non target insect from the

247
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,940
pollen from the BT corn that's targeted

248
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,129
at corn borer could be getting into

249
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,830
streams and could be potentially harming

250
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:10,179
the catus fight population a non target

251
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:12,009
insect potential risks are GM food safe

252
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:13,899
to eat it's a common question well

253
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,879
herbicide blocks the synthesis of

254
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:17,620
aromatic amino acids which is okay

255
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,439
because humans don't make any aromatic

256
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,959
amino acids so glyphosate is not harmful

257
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,339
to humans however gene modification is

258
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,528
that render the plant resistant if I

259
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:29,560
could say may introduce novel proteins

260
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:32,200
these may again may have the chance to

261
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:35,439
cause allergies and humans just put some

262
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,870
examples here of some of the aromatic

263
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,790
amino acids their full name their

264
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,889
three-letter abbreviation and also their

265
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:43,299
single letter abbreviation tryptophan

266
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:46,449
are probably most familiar with

267
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:49,269
especially around Thanksgiving TRP or WR

268
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,399
the abbreviations for them should GM

269
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:53,199
foods be labeled every serious

270
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,620
scientific investigation has included

271
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,480
that GM foods are safe there's no real

272
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,799
health risks so the question is well why

273
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,230
label something that's that harmful

274
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,479
however people basically have the right

275
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,100
to know and we are seeing

276
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,019
Creason labeling more laws are being

277
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,550
passed at the state level so we are

278
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:13,419
seeing an increase in Leyland of GM

279
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:15,219
crops GMO acreage genetic modified

280
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:18,669
organism acreage worldwide we see

281
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:22,600
overall vastly increasing on justjust

282
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:26,769
from 1996 to 2009 even from 2009 we're

283
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,730
seeing a continuation of this if you're

284
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,720
not familiar with the completely

285
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:34,360
Monsanto they are leading and pioneering

286
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,300
this Roundup resistance they developed

287
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,000
and make roundup and they are working on

288
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:41,528
increasing genetic modified food give

289
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,778
you their websites you can take a look

290
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:45,250
what they're advocating is that by

291
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:46,838
getting everyone involved informed we

292
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,120
can prepare to grow enough food for a

293
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,529
growing world that's one that's

294
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,839
predicted to be 9 billion people by 2050

295
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:57,789
so they're playing the side where need

296
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,360
to produce more food which is true and

297
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:03,458
they see genetically modified corn and

298
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,820
other crops as a way to supplement that

299
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:09,369
again people have this stigma against

300
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,410
the genetically modified crops there's

301
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,959
no scientific studies show there's any

302
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:16,480
major negative effects but the real

303
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:19,239
question is we just simply don't know we

304
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,769
don't have enough years of data and if

305
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,568
we start growing all genetically

306
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:24,519
modified crops and there's a problem

307
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:25,899
that develops down the road and that's

308
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,149
all we're growing that can lead to

309
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,889
potential issues also but we have to

310
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:31,750
keep in mind we have this delicate

311
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:34,629
balance of this ever-increasing world

312
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:38,730
population the main question is how are

313
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,730
we going to feed all these individuals
