1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,819
so in this video we're going to look

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,969
specifically at the kingdom of archaea

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,859
bacteria and you bacteria so there's

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,019
distinct differences between the two a

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,548
lot of times these get confused or kind

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,100
of merged together and they're different

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,358
so first the king of arkin bacteria they

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,770
inhibit some of the most extreme

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,660
environments on earth

10
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:25,670
some are autotrophic meaning they're

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:29,189
producing food by chemo synthesis some

12
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,529
archaea bacteria genes possess introns

13
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,079
so these are kind of make them kind of

14
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:36,750
unique individuals the extreme

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,950
environments is the hotsprings here this

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,058
is kind of what they look like if you

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,460
look under the microscope the kingdom of

18
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,250
Arc bacteria they share certain key

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,620
characteristics cell walls lacking

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,840
peptidoglycan so you'll remember back we

21
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,479
did Graham standing up bacteria we

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,000
looked at the pepto peptidoglycan

23
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,948
presence or absence of and where that

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,128
might be located they lack those

25
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:05,069
entirely usually lipids and unique our

26
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:07,289
RNA sequences remember our RNA is

27
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,599
referring to ribosomal RNA and unique

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,000
our RNA sequences indicate that there

29
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:16,169
can be classified by this as different

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,938
and unique and this is how we can start

31
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,519
to divide things into different kingdoms

32
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,219
we look for certain markers in this case

33
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,158
unusual lipid constructions which is our

34
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,828
fats unique ribosomal RNA sequences can

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,049
help us determine that this kind of

36
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,489
gives an example some of the membrane

37
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,368
structures that these archaea bacteria

38
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:37,140
may have and all the numbers are labeled

39
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:40,709
here I'm not going to get into that much

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,409
detail it does show some different lipid

41
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,489
sequences between bacteria and archaea

42
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,920
just so you can have that sense of

43
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:49,140
comparison we see here a very simple

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,210
chain format see here a lot more

45
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,200
branching so when it says unique lipids

46
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:56,519
this is what it's referring to

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,000
okay these are key bacteria are groups

48
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:02,879
into three general categories and these

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,030
are kind of based on the conditions that

50
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,519
they may be able to survive so this

51
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,370
method ends obtain energy by using

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,140
hydrogen gas to reduce carbon dioxide to

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,620
methane gas so you can see the kind of

54
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:15,119
word

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,908
thing in there and that's kind of what

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,150
they're using these extremophiles are

57
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:23,340
grown under extreme conditions

58
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,250
thermophiles music street heat hey Leo

59
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,219
thousand extreme salt to be why degree

60
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,229
of pH tolerance or pressure tolerance

61
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:33,239
but the example here of the deep ocean

62
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:36,090
vents this is an extremely stressful

63
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,980
environment but there's also non extreme

64
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,110
RQ bacteria he's growing the same

65
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,179
environment is bacteria dough needs to

66
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,340
be anaerobic environments such as those

67
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,590
that lack oxygen gas which is very

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,590
important for the respiration process

69
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:55,530
looking at a comparison chart between

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,109
the two our archaea bacteria and ru

71
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,689
bacteria or bacteria to me very simple

72
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:03,900
and living in these extreme conditions

73
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:05,489
I mean introns are present and there's

74
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,359
those three main types I talked about

75
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,950
moving over now to you bacteria they can

76
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:14,219
be a little more complex a little more

77
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:16,560
common than archaea bacteria introns are

78
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,689
absent or spliced out there's two main

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,560
types are gram positives or gram

80
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:21,750
negatives

81
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,400
you'll recognize these as being gram

82
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,469
positive because of their purple color

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,560
they're gram negatives it'd be a pinkish

84
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:33,840
red looking at you bacteria again

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,930
classifying these your bacteria are the

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,370
most abundant organisms on earth they

87
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,340
play critical roles throughout the

88
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,799
biosphere most Texans recognize 12 to 15

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,799
major groups and bacteria are different

90
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,500
from archaea bacteria as they are from

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,680
eukaryotes so they are their own unique

92
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,590
classification remember remember the you

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,489
bacteria being just bacteria there's

94
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,930
simple structure prokaryotic in nature

95
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:03,269
through different shapes that we can use

96
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,329
to help identify them and you'll see all

97
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:08,099
not all taxon is to agree 12 to 15 major

98
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:13,409
groups that's why there's some variants

99
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:15,659
there so the team of you bacteria they

100
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:17,728
reproduce by binary fission and we kind

101
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,738
of see that going on here in this image

102
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:21,620
this includes disease-causing bacteria

103
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,359
such as tooth decay or food poisoning

104
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,209
and archaea bacteria and new bacteria

105
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,979
contain all of the prokaryotes and

106
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:31,049
both be produced by this binary fission

107
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,879
this division that's occurring but they

108
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,699
do have some ways to recombine genes

109
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:39,449
allowing for evolution to occur remember

110
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,220
back to our plasmids those in DNA

111
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:43,129
sequences can be transferred

112
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,300
also notice the petri dishes here of

113
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:49,589
Staphylococcus that's an example that

114
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,620
you vector gram-negative bacteria have

115
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:55,049
this sausage Elam this flagellum are

116
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,970
plural of the flagella is a long slender

117
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,340
projection from the body cell that

118
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,440
rotates like a propeller and this allows

119
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:02,848
the bacteria to swim so you think of it

120
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,668
kind of going along and swimming right

121
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:07,918
along Ecoline Salmonella are two

122
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:10,348
examples of this so hopefully this

123
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:13,639
clarifies in the difference between our

124
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:16,288
new bacteria and our archaea bacteria

125
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,319
and are able to tell the difference

126
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:22,550
between those two and identify certain

127
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,550
characteristics with each
