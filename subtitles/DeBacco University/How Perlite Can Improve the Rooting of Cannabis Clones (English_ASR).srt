00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,479
going to take a look and see how perlite

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,400
can improve your rooting in your clones

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,400
now if you're using oasis and put one of

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,160
those trays that's commonly done adding

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,839
some perlite to the bottom right when

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,439
you take your clones is going to be very

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,359
important if you wait a little bit

9
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,039
couple days and then add it you're going

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,800
to see in this video when you go out to

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,640
the greenhouse the comparison between

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,400
adding it right away and adding it just

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,240
a couple days later and the importance

14
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,399
of when you take those clones saturating

15
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,399
that oasis putting perlite in the bottom

16
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,238
and then adding your clones so let's go

17
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,439
to the greenhouse and let's take a look

18
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,439
to see the comparison

19
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:43,279
[Music]

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
okay if you want a little tip if you're

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,679
using oasis cubes for your clones would

22
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,159
help encourage rooting let's add a

23
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:53,119
little perlite below that oasis so that

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,398
plant isn't soaking in that water so if

25
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,558
you look at some of the ones we have

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,039
here as an example

27
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,439
we'll look at these here

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,679
and these had this perlite added a

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,679
little bit late so this was kind of when

30
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,319
we first saw the issue well here we're

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,320
seeing you know pretty good rooting

32
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,118
well here's plants right next to it the

33
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,679
same age it had the perlite put in right

34
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,519
at the beginning so how did they look or

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,200
how is there rooting a little different

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,640
and i think we can commonly agree that

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,799
there's definitely better rooting on

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,359
these that had the perlite added at the

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,118
very beginning versus these that had

40
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,920
added a little bit later really when we

41
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:31,920
saw the total results so pretty good

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
stark difference there between adding

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,759
perlite from the start or adding a

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,240
little bit later when you're setting up

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,840
your oasis for your clones

46
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,399
add that perlite right in there as a

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,159
beginning step and you two can have good

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,439
rooting as well

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,359
so again quick look at the rooting

50
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:50,719
comparison those that had it added later

51
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,200
and here are the ones that had it added

52
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,078
from the very beginning

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,000
much better rooting here than over here

54
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,839
indicating just a little bit of air

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,718
really helps those roots explode go

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,560
through

57
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,000
develop good clones i personally

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,920
wouldn't recommend cutting the leaves i

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
like to leave full leaves

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,878
as you can see here as far as a rooting

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,480
base definitely that perlite helps those

62
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,479
roots breathe a little bit more and

63
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,959
hopefully will increase your success in

64
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,959
the cloning process
