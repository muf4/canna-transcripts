1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,659
okay he were to discuss a little bit

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,580
that is often debated should I be using

3
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:08,099
chemical fertilizers or should I be

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,839
using organic fertilizers so I gonna

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,449
give you a background about a little bit

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,388
of what defines each and to give you

7
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:18,089
this that appreciation for when it might

8
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,618
be best to use one or another so first

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:21,509
off chemical fertilizers I put those in

10
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,759
quotes here because all nutrients come

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,170
down to chemistry but chemical

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,179
fertilizers is typically what's

13
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,050
referring to a manufactured product a

14
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:33,030
man-made man created product versus

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,340
organic is tends to refer to something

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,630
that naturally occurs so within those

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,100
chemical fertilizers are often

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,020
water-soluble so if you add in the water

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,840
look kind of diffused through and mix

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,309
very well this makes because they mix so

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,190
well this makes the application process

22
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:49,799
very easy this form is very friendly to

23
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:52,589
a variety of irrigation methods Kuzmin

24
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,849
hydroponic setup drip irrigation systems

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,100
used a water tank as a reservoir

26
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,739
overhead for example all of these

27
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,320
irrigation methods are applicable for

28
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:06,329
most chemical water soluble fertilizers

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,310
now with the ease of application this

30
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:11,789
can help agora maintain a very clean

31
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,799
operation usually in a bag it can take a

32
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,330
spoonful take an exact amount out and

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,700
keep everything nice and clean and neat

34
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,739
growers can also precisely it's called

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,079
spoon-feeding additions where they're

36
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,298
taking the exact amount very small

37
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,908
amount here and exactly adding it to the

38
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,200
hopefully happy plants however caution

39
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,000
must be taken that to over apply these

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,829
fertilizers which increases the odds of

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,328
burning the plants so chemical

42
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:35,639
fertilizers because they're easy to be

43
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,859
added sometimes can be over added and as

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,900
a result there's a chance a girl could

45
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,299
burn their plants if they don't follow

46
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,149
the right ratios and the right feeding

47
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,220
regimen now in contrast to that organic

48
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,960
fertilizers are not mint at manufactured

49
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,789
we're typically found in nature in one

50
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,709
form of another they're considered to be

51
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,899
natural fertilizers such as soui newer

52
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:57,419
worm castings bone meal blood meal

53
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,468
there's a whole bunch of a variety but

54
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,689
they're typically thought of as

55
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,959
occurring naturally in nature net

56
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:06,089
circuits the term organic the nutrients

57
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,340
release is typically a slower release in

58
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,800
those chemical based fertilizers in the

59
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,330
applications can be more limiting may

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,740
can be very difficult for example to

61
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,500
spread manure

62
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,300
as I say run that through some

63
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,900
irrigation systems it could clog drip

64
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,300
tapes it could be you know cause a odor

65
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,400
to develop and reservoirs so again as a

66
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,930
result would be more limiting however it

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000
is still possible to over add and create

68
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,430
toxic conditions to your soil and plants

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,930
especially with some manures we notice

70
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,900
looking at phosphorus in particular

71
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,150
while it is organic and natural over

72
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,610
application can still lead to toxic

73
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,990
conditions for some nutrients so keep in

74
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,000
mind because you're using organic

75
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,010
fertilizers it doesn't mean it's free

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,930
range and you can do no harm now for

77
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:51,479
unit fertilizers that organic has main

78
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,969
definitions and some actually contradict

79
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,639
one another so scientific definition of

80
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,469
organic are compounds containing carbon

81
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,799
that's kind of a central part of organic

82
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,939
means carbon such as organic chemistry

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,680
misleading definition is like organic

84
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,819
farming and it's produced without the

85
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,659
use of chemical fertilizers pesticides

86
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,909
are our other artificial agents so

87
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,919
organic does not mean no sprite I want

88
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,789
to get that point kind of across that if

89
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,889
you're buying something that's

90
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:18,539
organically produced it doesn't mean it

91
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:21,299
wasn't sprayed with anything it means

92
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,780
typically the items it could have been

93
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,760
sprayed with come from a limited list

94
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,409
now that limited list most organic

95
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,539
growers using kind of Omri may have

96
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,879
heard of that term since for the organic

97
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:35,400
materials review Institute they have a

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,620
list of over 5500 products approved for

99
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,140
organic production based on the USDA

100
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,500
National Organic Program standards don't

101
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:45,479
you see this USDA Organic seal 189

102
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,530
results contains some copper base to

103
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:52,349
them so of this 5500 list of potential

104
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,840
products almost 190 of them contains

105
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,310
some sort of copper base copper can

106
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,469
accumulate an environment and does not

107
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:03,000
contain carbon so you have to be mindful

108
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:06,060
of whatever situation or whatever kind

109
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,590
of definition you're using while Omri is

110
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,170
considered by many to be the gold

111
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,120
standard it does contain products such

112
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,639
as those can that contain copper that

113
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,699
can potentially harm the environment you

114
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,649
just want to be mindful of and

115
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:21,329
understand all about the nutrients and

116
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,179
all about the products that you have

117
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,609
access to and utilize them where they're

118
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,600
best used but realize just because it's

119
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,030
organic doesn't

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,150
you can't over add to the environment or

121
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:35,129
cause potential toxicity issues the

122
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:37,079
organic material breakdown with many

123
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:39,029
organic materials especially manures the

124
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,550
goal is to use them after a sufficient

125
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,109
composting process fresh manures can

126
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,569
easily burn plants they're called like

127
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,460
hot manures hot nitrogen also under

128
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,680
Organic Standards is often a required

129
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:52,079
number of days from Lenoir application

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,790
to harvest of any crop this means you

131
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,969
can't apply manure and then go harvest

132
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,129
that field there can be 120 days 180

133
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,900
days restriction from when you first

134
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:03,120
apply that manure to when you can

135
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,519
harvest off that field we want to know

136
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,709
your source of material also and if you

137
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,539
do get it fresh be sure to compost it

138
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:11,909
properly or be sure this source is

139
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,050
following a composting procedure here

140
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,820
they're nice they're turning their

141
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,770
compost here it's kind of a stagnant

142
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,959
pile coming down a barn so just kind of

143
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:20,609
know your source not only what type of

144
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,329
manure it is but how it's being treated

145
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,230
before it comes to your operation

146
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:27,300
organically growing cannabis this is

147
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,040
kind of something that anecdotally

148
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,300
growers have reported if it's

149
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,780
organically grown there's a proof

150
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,980
tasters improvement Roma's compared to a

151
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:37,529
cannabis plant that may have been

152
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,520
treated with chemical fertilizer so

153
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:40,319
while this hasn't really been

154
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,060
scientifically proven that there's a

155
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,740
true difference between organically

156
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,269
grown and chemically grown the

157
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,430
difference could be in part due to the

158
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:50,279
overall grower practices in not solely

159
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,050
based on the type of fertilizer used so

160
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,519
keep in mind that there's more at play

161
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,110
than just saying oh I use organic

162
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,689
fertilizer I use chemical fertilizer

163
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,000
because even organic fertilizer what

164
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:02,310
you're adding are kind of chemical

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,529
components so be mindful of maybe other

166
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,810
growing practices because there's been

167
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,639
no scientific proof at least to this

168
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,100
point that organically grown cannabis
