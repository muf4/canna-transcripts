1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,318
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,759
looking at the importance of testing

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:16,160
cannabis plant material

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:17,679
for pesticide residues

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,199
all right let's get into testing canvas

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,320
plant material for

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,080
residues of pesticides so first off

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,518
here's our research article role of mass

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,598
spec in canvas industry

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,198
gonna highlight some of the information

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
presented here but always welcome to

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,679
take a look at this in more detail

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,039
so pesticide concerns will pesticide

14
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,880
residues have become a significant

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,399
problem for the cannabis industry

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,000
because the final product can be

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,679
concentrated or burned

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,159
resulting in alterations that are not

19
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,200
typically associated with other plant

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,038
materials

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,760
as a result the levels of pesticides and

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,239
herbicides should be very low or absent

23
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,839
in cannabis final end product plant

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,159
material

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,520
so keep in mind this is not only an

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,679
outdoor problem a lot of people think

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,239
pesticides oh it's for outdoor grown

28
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,079
cannabis no this also can be applied to

29
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,319
the controlled indoor environments

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,920
are still subject to insect bacterial

31
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,879
and fungal pests that can negatively

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,118
impact plants

33
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,319
which could warrant the application of

34
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,920
pesticides

35
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,079
due to the threat of plant loss the use

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,118
of pesticides is of increased temptation

37
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,640
by growers

38
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,879
to ensure that they're not going to lose

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,680
the crop and all the money and time that

40
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,839
they've invested in that crop

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,479
so a lot of people go to it organically

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
grown or organic does not necessarily

43
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,159
mean

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,360
no spray numerous detections of low to

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,719
moderate levels of pesticide

46
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,359
contamination

47
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,719
tens of parts per billion or less from a

48
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,519
number of growers claiming to use

49
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,759
organic

50
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,000
or clean green growing methods prompted

51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,478
investigation of possible sources

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,118
so organic does not mean pesticide free

53
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,519
organic means typically that there is a

54
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,438
smaller list of products that could be

55
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,478
applied and still qualify the

56
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,718
resulting plant material as organic

57
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,000
now reliable chemical analysis is

58
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,158
important when we're looking

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,920
at testing in general so reliable

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,439
chemical analysis of plant material

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,239
before it's consumed is important to

62
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,799
ensure the absence of pesticides

63
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,480
cannabis tested with confidence now

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
pesticide tolerance when we're looking

65
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,000
at

66
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,000
other materials is definitely

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,159
listed here apple beef egg grape hops

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,598
and milk here then we're seeing the

69
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,280
microbutanol which is an active

70
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,079
ingredient in eagle 20s it's a broad

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,318
spectrum

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
it's considered slightly hazardous and

73
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,119
then we have imma proclaim which is an

74
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
insecticide

75
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
found in a brand name called merit is

76
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,359
called is considered to be moderately

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,759
hazardous so we see the comparisons of

78
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,720
those two in these different crops here

79
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,439
we also see the marijuana extracts here

80
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,199
and looking

81
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,120
at kind of an idea of some of the

82
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,439
changes that occurred

83
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,599
in comparison to some other crops as

84
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,919
well so again important to understand

85
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,119
pesticide tolerance levels for different

86
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,639
state regulations

87
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,878
and that's going to appear on the

88
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,559
analytical report as well

89
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,000
so let's use that micro butanol just as

90
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
a quick example here

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,439
micro butanol is the most prevalent

92
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,879
pesticide detected and is most commonly

93
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,079
used for the treatment of mold

94
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,719
infestations

95
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
which sadly can be very common in

96
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,840
cannabis plants

97
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,840
the microbutal is a fungicide that when

98
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,479
present in cannabis plant material

99
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,000
is smoked via cigarette is released via

100
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,878
toxic gas hydrogen

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,080
cyanide this is why it's so of a high

102
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,959
level of concern

103
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,719
in cannabis simply because when ignited

104
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,799
it's creating this hydrogen cyanide

105
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,878
itself doesn't contain

106
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,480
hydrogen cyanide because that's a gas

107
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,479
when you vaporize it that

108
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,679
induced heat is causing a change in the

109
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,798
chemical structure

110
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,239
to hydrogen sine very very high level of

111
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,719
concern

112
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,519
now state by state list again keep this

113
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,680
in mind

114
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,360
check your local state regulations each

115
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
state has its own list for pesticides

116
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
which must be monitored in cannabis

117
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,919
samples

118
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
california for example currently has a

119
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,598
list of 66

120
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,318
pesticides which must be monitored where

121
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,238
21

122
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,158
in the list are in category 1 and should

123
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,560
not be detected in cannabis products

124
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,598
while the other 45 pesticides in

125
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,239
category 2

126
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,878
should not exceed indicated action

127
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,080
levels at low parts per billion ppb

128
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:16,159
lower limits of quantitation so again

129
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
knowing where that kind of falls what

130
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,280
pesticides fall in what category

131
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,280
here we're looking at the distribution

132
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,758
of clones passing or failing

133
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,799
california pesticide action limits green

134
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,800
equals passing

135
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,040
red equals failure so you can see the

136
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,800
number of clones tested that passed or

137
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,919
failed proposed california

138
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,560
pesticide threshold from market reality

139
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,198
in cannabis the portion represents red

140
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,800
is graph

141
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,080
is the total failure so 77.4 failed 22.6

142
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,639
did pass it's

143
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,199
also where we get into that kind of gray

144
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,560
area

145
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,400
of if they're grown in california and

146
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,399
shipped to somewhere else

147
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,000
will that impact whether they fail or

148
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,839
they pass but it's looking at

149
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
california produced clones with

150
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,560
california limits here

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,240
now canvas chemical complexity so

152
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,918
separation the use of mass spec

153
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,918
are analytical methods that can help

154
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,079
handle these complexities of the plant

155
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,240
and also low parts per billion levels

156
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,839
required by state regulations

157
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,240
other analysis have been employed in the

158
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,879
past for measuring some pesticides

159
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,319
but typically your mass spec techniques

160
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,600
tend to be the ones that are in

161
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,599
generally preferred

162
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
and there's gas chromatography there's

163
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,080
liquid chromatography here a little

164
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,399
comparison

165
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,839
between the two here with that kind of

166
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,519
mass spec chromatography

167
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,198
looking at the specifics here a little

168
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,758
different kind of processes

169
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,000
but still getting those results here at

170
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,000
the end for comparison

171
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,319
now suggested techniques just in general

172
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,399
so looking at all the options in many

173
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,240
cases pesticide levels are in the mid to

174
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,000
low parts per billion range

175
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,840
and this is looking at a liquid

176
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
chromatography mass spec approach

177
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,198
may be appropriate for those samples

178
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,960
containing very low parts billion levels

179
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,759
of unknown pesticides it may be

180
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,680
preferred

181
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,439
to employ some of these techniques in

182
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,840
high resolution mass spec

183
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,639
employing this orbit trap as well

184
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,638
there's also

185
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
you can see here a recent webinars

186
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,000
looking at this importance of testing

187
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,000
looking at kind of getting this

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,759
information out and seeing and

189
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
evaluating these different testing

190
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,080
techniques to make sure labs are

191
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,800
utilizing

192
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,758
the most efficient ones possible now

193
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,600
looking at these techniques for

194
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
pesticide detection here so not getting

195
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,439
into too much of the details

196
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,638
but we can clearly see that there's a

197
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,038
lot of

198
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,478
availability to test here in general

199
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:25,360
most state laboratories including new

200
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,519
york state

201
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,120
suggest the liquid chromatography mass

202
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,279
spec techniques for the quantitative

203
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,000
determination of pesticides and cannabis

204
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,399
hemp

205
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,918
and products derived from them so keep

206
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,679
in mind this goes beyond of just the

207
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,279
actual dry flower material

208
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,038
any products derived from them should

209
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,079
also be going through this same level of

210
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,759
testing

211
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,439
this technology coupled with recommended

212
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,520
sample preparation provides broad

213
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,598
coverage with high sensitivity

214
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,680
and also selectivity for the

215
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,719
quantitative determination of over

216
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,959
100 pesticides so it really allows a

217
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,639
very efficient way to detect any

218
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:02,159
presence of those pesticides

219
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,680
on the plant samples submitted so lastly

220
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,240
challenge with pesticide testing just in

221
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,759
general

222
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,759
the inherent challenge is that if the

223
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,160
pesticide is not tested for

224
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,199
it could be present but simply not

225
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,039
identified

226
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,360
however having chemist plant material

227
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,079
testing for the likely pesticide

228
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,520
used is a very important step if it is

229
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,839
just an initial step

230
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,519
consumers should be ensuring any product

231
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,638
they're considering purchasing has the

232
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,879
proper testing

233
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,800
and this documentation is checked before

234
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,079
buying and using that product

235
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,598
so just because they can't test for

236
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,279
everything they're testing for a good

237
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,079
subset of those samples

238
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,959
and your proposed material passes all

239
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,879
those samples

240
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,120
it can be a good indication at least for

241
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,839
pesticides that that sample is probably

242
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
clean

243
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,119
keep in mind there's other testing such

244
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
as heavy metals and mycotoxins

245
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,639
that should also be taken into

246
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,160
consideration this is just a look at

247
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,079
educating you

248
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,080
on the specifics of pesticide testing in

249
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,079
cannabis
