1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
so here we're gonna looking at gross

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,370
sight temperature monitoring so there's

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,009
a lot of different systems out there

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,830
miles sometimes after home systems were

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,388
monitoring many conditions at once

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,519
through maybe smart devices or other

7
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,169
kind of wireless systems this is just

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,949
kind of give you an idea of monitoring

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,868
your gross sight

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,210
temperature in particular are also very

11
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:22,589
important so starting with the basics

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,850
well depending on the size of your grow

13
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,009
operation you may want to consider

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,630
multiple thermometers for large

15
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,279
operations to recommend that you install

16
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,678
multiple what's called min/max

17
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,679
thermometers they tell you basically

18
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,500
over time the minimum temperature and

19
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,689
the maximum temperature that your area

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,369
has experienced and this simply could

21
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,289
see here it shows you the maximum when

22
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,359
it pushes up and the minimum down here

23
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,769
so it's very efficient and quick read

24
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,689
and you push this button and it resets

25
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,250
itself leverage I say you may want to

26
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,259
install multiples depending on the size

27
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,869
of your area you may want to put me near

28
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,280
the ceiling in the plant canopy and near

29
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,229
the floor to give you a better idea

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,239
what's actually going on in the grow

31
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,500
environment are the most important one

32
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,509
of course is the one near the plant

33
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,159
canopy but if you're seeing something on

34
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:06,780
going on there sometimes you might want

35
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,030
install some other ones just to get an

36
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,760
idea of what might be going on above or

37
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,739
even below the plants now an advanced

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,790
system being in to install what's called

39
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,228
a data logger

40
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,180
this can help check multiple conditions

41
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:20,519
at regular intervals to help you make

42
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,659
informed decisions and also double check

43
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,819
to make sure everything is working

44
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,530
properly here's one an example of a

45
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,508
field one on the outside you're a great

46
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,618
field and this is monitoring a whole

47
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,438
host of things wind direction wind speed

48
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:36,060
rainfall temperature I'm out of sunlight

49
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:38,008
I'm sure gonna be a lot of things you

50
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,740
can look at make some very small ones

51
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,899
here on the monitor temperature and so

52
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,179
the sky's the limit on what you want to

53
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,978
monitor but keep in mind that the more

54
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,399
conditions you can monitor the more odds

55
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:53,459
you are to have control over what you

56
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,079
can yield from here to here the better

57
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,849
idea you have and what went right or

58
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,798
what went wrong the better idea gave you

59
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:01,798
to make modifications going forward

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,899
now there's thermostats so we're looking

61
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,280
at that grow room that grow area there's

62
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,038
something called single stages and

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,179
double stages single stage are set for

64
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,678
either heating or cooling when

65
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,459
temperature goes above or below a

66
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,830
certain setting

67
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,319
further called single stage

68
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,090
that temperature and turn on either the

69
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,409
exhaust fan that's getting too warm or

70
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,170
could turn on the heater if it's getting

71
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:24,150
too cold the double stage is a single

72
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:26,129
unit that has two temperatures to help

73
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,740
you maintain the temperature within a

74
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,509
very specific range so for example it

75
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,070
hits one temperature can turn a fan on

76
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:34,139
that's when whatever's getting too hot

77
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,699
for when it's getting too cold it can

78
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,799
turn on a heater all within a single

79
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,319
unit here that's why it's called double

80
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,360
stage and cut has an upper a maximum and

81
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,769
a minimum and they're the single stage

82
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,710
we'll just do one temperature on one

83
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,840
result thermostat placement is very

84
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,370
important so where you set to physically

85
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,930
place your thermostat it's critical for

86
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,430
its ability to function properly you

87
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,800
want to consider the vertical location

88
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,640
and also the Sun or light exposure that

89
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,620
you may have

90
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,139
keep in mind hot air rises and cold air

91
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,250
sinks so where you mount that thermostat

92
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:08,309
will cage in effect when your ear when

93
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,319
your exhaust fan may come on or also may

94
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,120
affect when your heater comes on so you

95
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,219
keep in mind of where you actually place

96
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,890
that should be very representative of

97
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,629
your girl facility now choosing between

98
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,789
digital or analog units that can be

99
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,009
debated digital's allow for an exact

100
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:24,929
control but can have a higher failure

101
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:27,509
rate in part due to the high humidity

102
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,770
that these are typically placed in so

103
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,019
just keep that in mind they're getting

104
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,189
better systems but it's an area where

105
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,050
it's going to be a lot of irrigation a

106
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:37,050
lot of humidity those have a higher

107
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,910
tendency of failing analogs may have

108
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,010
some more play in them exactly as far as

109
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,870
what the exact temperature may be but

110
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:45,539
often can be more reliable more robust

111
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,009
especially in grow facilities we're

112
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,560
dealing with a lot of humidity and a lot

113
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,599
of chance of water splash and so on and

114
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,610
so forth so the only books can ideally

115
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,500
do the same job the digital can give you

116
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,810
some more controls but could have a

117
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,219
chance at failure mechanical ones might

118
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,870
a little bit more play in them but once

119
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,680
you get them dialed in can be a little

120
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,680
bit more robust
