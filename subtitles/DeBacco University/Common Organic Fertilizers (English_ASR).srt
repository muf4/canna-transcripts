1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
okay here I'm gonna go over some common

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,869
organic fertilizers that are used by

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,759
many growers typically you might see

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,160
these as ingredients in super soil or

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:14,339
things that people add to different

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,719
mixes these are just some common ones so

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,929
we want you to realize that this is not

8
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:21,000
a complete list in general I provide the

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,129
nitrogen phosphorus potassium the NPK

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,809
fertilizer ratio that's just simply

11
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,368
provided as a guide different

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:28,349
manufacturers different blends may have

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,640
slightly different numbers what's

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,559
included will be some of the common

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,058
products used by growers I'm going to

16
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,280
provide you with the main source meaning

17
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:35,849
where it comes from the availability to

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,350
the plant

19
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,840
how does quick does the plant have

20
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,359
access to those nutrients what's used

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,800
for and also in these particular key

22
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,899
notes I feel you shouldn't need to know

23
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,119
about that particular fertilizer so

24
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,160
let's start with the first one here a

25
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,019
very broad-based let's go with manure so

26
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,599
sources animals now it depends on one

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,609
animal using horse or cow or llama or

28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,219
rabbit there's many different types of

29
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,140
sources as a result of ill that it can

30
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,390
be impacted by the type of bedding used

31
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,969
so we see like we knew her for sale here

32
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,219
that's all well and good however we want

33
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,228
to look at the bedding that's used in

34
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,798
this case it looks like a lot of no hay

35
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:15,478
or straw is it sawdust is it is it no

36
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,939
bedding and that can affect the

37
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,500
availability sawdust would be the least

38
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:20,819
advantageous because that will absorb a

39
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,099
lot of the nitrogen as it goes to

40
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,109
breakdown uses the members of common

41
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,780
soil additives should be properly

42
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:29,250
compost be cautious of potential weed

43
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,079
seeds especially for getting horse

44
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,450
manure chicken manure is considered to

45
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,478
be the most potent can also be the most

46
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,579
ramas odor or smell oh you want to know

47
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,109
the source of your manure and again

48
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,239
watch the phosphorous and do not read

49
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,069
excessive conditions so you should be

50
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,408
taking a soil sample annoying

51
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,328
approximately how much to add without

52
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,210
increasing your phosphorous to toxic or

53
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:53,099
above optimum conditions compost is

54
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,319
another one is you do plant base it's

55
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,968
moderately available to plants that's a

56
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,739
very common soil amendment to increase

57
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,809
water retention and deliver a broad base

58
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:02,509
of nutrients again you want to know the

59
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,579
source is it composed mainly of leaves

60
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,709
is that composted mushroom compost is a

61
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,689
combination of what type of leaves the

62
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:12,120
combination of sticks again all that

63
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:13,859
commune that means you can over add and

64
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,390
create water issues in high nutria

65
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,830
levels we can actually hurt plant meals

66
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,169
I don't think it's just oh it's compost

67
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,670
I can keep adding decomposed leaves our

68
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,289
good base to start with

69
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:24,750
because sometimes compost could contain

70
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:27,030
manure base things typically want to

71
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,699
have that leaf place and just again

72
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,060
watch the water retention with alfalfa

73
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,859
meal

74
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,259
it's from the alfalfa plant it's very

75
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,870
slow to be available to the plant to

76
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,409
access can we use also has animal feed

77
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,090
for the protein or as a soil amendment

78
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:44,039
pellets form is really great to apply

79
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,620
but this would be slower to break down

80
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,389
there should be a supplement in that a

81
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,550
main nutrient so if you're adding

82
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:53,189
alfalfa meant for the nitrogen plant may

83
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,600
not give quick enough access to that we

84
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:57,620
can keep my pellets well might be easy

85
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:01,319
to apply can be a slower to break down

86
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,120
that wanna source of caves or it's

87
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,129
basically bat manure I can be very

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,650
rapidly accessible especially for a

89
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:10,469
nitrogen source which is commonly used

90
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,090
for while it can be used for nitrogen

91
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:13,169
don't forget about the other nutrients

92
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,090
here you're adding particularly

93
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:16,738
phosphorus and potassium you want to

94
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,719
also consider these sustainability and

95
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,430
the shipping expense of where that

96
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,400
manure may actually be coming from what

97
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,750
country or what region of the world

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,510
seabird guano cut very similar to vat

99
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,250
mono its seabird manure she's kind of

100
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:32,280
see right here fresh at seabird manure

101
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,889
that's quickly available and it's used

102
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,030
as a nitrogen and phosphorus source so

103
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:37,919
here a little bit bigger numbers at

104
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,530
least in this instance given the life

105
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,939
above balance though so it provides some

106
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,860
of the major nutrients which is great

107
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:45,329
but be careful the ratios because if

108
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,060
you're applying for the nitrogen content

109
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,160
most likely you'll be over adding on the

110
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,590
phosphorus to your particular growing

111
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,750
medium so again it's be mindful of some

112
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,219
of the contents that the seabird guano

113
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,439
others have bone meal many main sources

114
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,239
bones from the slaughter industry it's a

115
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,489
very slow to kind of moderate release it

116
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,019
does increase phosphorus we see there be

117
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,450
sure the pH is under seven to keep the

118
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,810
availability of phosphorus higher if

119
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:14,069
you're are showing an issue with that

120
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,539
however can be slow acting that takes a

121
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,430
while to break down so it's not a good

122
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,930
quick fix if you're getting later in the

123
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,810
season and you're noticing phosphorus

124
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,879
issues adding bone meal may not be your

125
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,530
best source for the availability aspect

126
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,540
then there's blood meal

127
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:30,989
slaughter history again it's a trap

128
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,810
source ants uses this for nitrogen 1200

129
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,939
it's very quick acting meaning if you

130
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,889
apply it today three days after

131
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,350
application you should see a difference

132
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:42,479
in your plants it's almost a pure source

133
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,980
of nitrogen however is expensive

134
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,170
compared to other chemical forms of

135
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,600
nitrogen and is kind of this blackish

136
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,949
kind of color there so you know not the

137
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,260
typical red that you would associate

138
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,120
with blood it is this kind of dark red

139
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,939
almost blackish coloration most of the

140
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,230
time fish meal is dried fish waste it's

141
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:59,819
quickly available to endangered and

142
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,550
source with some other nutrients and

143
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:04,469
also amino acids be careful because it

144
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,540
can be very difficult to mix with water

145
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,250
so typically you may want to use warm

146
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,500
water and take some time to make sure

147
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,029
that this does integrate and mix well

148
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,189
with the water before you go to apply

149
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:17,129
any kind of pockets a very concentrated

150
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:19,560
mix and then very dilute fish emulsion

151
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:21,449
is on to the fish waste also quickly

152
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,579
available a nitrogen source with some

153
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:26,430
other nutrients and also amino acids

154
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:28,769
again I say the ratios here provided as

155
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,259
a suggestion here on miss Neptune's

156
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:33,810
harvest with its two for one so again

157
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,819
just watch the particularly manufacture

158
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,699
you choose to buy from this is a very

159
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,529
common form of fish fertilizer it does

160
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,810
typically have a stabilizer added to it

161
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:45,659
which comely is an acid that helped

162
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,899
increase the time to be able to use it

163
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,340
before it may spoil or go rancid so keep

164
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:52,879
my net peach might be a little bit lower

165
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,259
if you are and hopefully testing the pH

166
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,399
seaweed also called kelp sushi cooked

167
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,099
because usually comes from Coldwater

168
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,409
kelp moderately available it's a general

169
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,420
soil conditioner it also be applies to

170
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,490
the leaves in some cases it does contain

171
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,439
micronutrients and plant hormones come

172
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,139
lose at this seedling stage you can see

173
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,660
it favors potassium in particular a very

174
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,519
dilute products so not one to rely on to

175
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,680
support the nutrient needs at the plant

176
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,229
that can be adding seaweed for its

177
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,030
nitrogen source for example while those

178
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,890
have many other good properties it's not

179
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:24,119
going to be that the main feed

180
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:26,759
especially if you're looking at

181
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,560
deficiency symptoms then we have green

182
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,329
sand odds mine from the ocean floor

183
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,149
commonly off the coast of New Jersey

184
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:35,639
it's a slow release and it has potassium

185
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:37,319
and some other micronutrients due to the

186
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,789
slow availability it doesn't mean you

187
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,740
can count on the potassium to meet the

188
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,310
plant demands should be used as an

189
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,439
additional

190
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,660
then men if at all because if it's slow

191
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,219
availability would possibly be better

192
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,290
I'll turn it off to plain sands are

193
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,419
looking at adding sand and to add to

194
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,490
your media maybe you choose green sand

195
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,859
for some of its micronutrient properties

196
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,780
and also a little fertilizer also tied

197
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,240
in with it okay so lastly here gonna

198
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:01,888
look at worm castings I mean the main

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,960
source is red wigglers not the

200
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,910
earthworms we see here it's very quickly

201
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,859
available and often used as a soil

202
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,380
amendment itself and added for the

203
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,080
diverse microbes that it contains to

204
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,060
help increase soil biology only a small

205
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,800
amounts needed and if the conditions are

206
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,509
favorable as the microbes will multiply

207
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,550
so don't think it to grow purely in worm

208
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:22,980
castings another advantage especially

209
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,650
being added to soil media is that has a

210
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,950
near neutral pH so that's again why it's

211
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:30,359
liked by many growers this is again it's

212
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,728
usually that brief overview of some of

213
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,590
the organic fertilizer options that are

214
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:37,139
available to you in sums you commonly

215
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,759
see in super soil hopefully this does

216
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,589
give me a nice background to determine

217
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,990
whether or not it's worth considering

218
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:45,739
that as an additive to your particular

219
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,740
growing media
