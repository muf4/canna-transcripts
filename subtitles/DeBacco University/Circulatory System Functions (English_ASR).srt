1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
this is going to be a very brief

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:06,060
overview of the functions of the

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,429
circulatory system the reason why this

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,259
image is pictured here is you may want

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,809
to think about some of the functions

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:16,170
that the circulatory system does that's

7
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:17,039
kind of like what a city may require so

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,660
let's get into it

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,939
starting with transportation that's

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,278
probably the most obvious one the

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,640
circulatory system is responsible for

12
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:29,789
transporting oxygen to cells for the

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,710
process of respiration and also taking

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,320
away carbon dioxide from those same

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,710
cells bring it to either the gills or

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,549
the lungs so it can be eliminated or

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:43,679
some way leaves the body system also the

18
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:46,558
circulatory system needs to absorb

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,710
products from digestion and bring them

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,019
to cells and the same thing as it's

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,058
bringing nutrients to the cells it also

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,370
needs to have a way to take the waste

23
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,679
products away from the cells this could

24
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:00,238
also be excessive water in the human

25
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,049
body this we brought to the kidney and

26
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:06,359
excreted in the urine two other main

27
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,790
functions are regulation where the

28
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,489
circulatory system is taking hormones

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,890
and transporting them from it's part of

30
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:16,890
the endocrine system to distant organs

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,769
it also helps maintain homeostasis in

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,170
the body by way of keeping a constant

33
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,298
temperature

34
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,430
lastly protection blood clotting

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,368
protects against blood loss and that's

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,430
important function along with caring

37
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:35,009
white blood cells around the body so

38
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,280
that there can be an immunity provided

39
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,810
against disease-causing agents so again

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,329
as promised this is a very brief

41
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,399
overview of the three main categories of

42
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:47,239
functions of the body's circulatory

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,239
system
