1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,980
okay here we're gonna go over a brief at

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:07,140
squash seed selection planting in

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:10,199
protecting does hopefully encourage your

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:12,509
odds of this successful crop so first

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,039
one is squash seed selection

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,230
well you'd understand there's two basic

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,660
varieties there's summer squash and

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,160
there's winter squash and you don't have

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,260
to grow every different variety because

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,420
you'll find many but these are general

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,730
classifications zucchini crookneck

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,470
squash for your summers cuban might need

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,330
have to be kind of harvested about every

14
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,159
day or every other day and when do

15
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,769
squashes will keep longer you know

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:38,009
examples of those are eight coins

17
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,809
delicata and butternut so they within

18
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,369
the acorn in particular you'll find many

19
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:43,289
different subsets and varieties

20
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,419
different growth habits and these are

21
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,640
all things to consider but if you grow

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,770
want to focus on these different

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,750
categories this would give you a wide

24
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,170
variety to provide to either your CSA

25
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,058
members or at market so squash seed

26
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,730
germination it's not recommended that

27
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,530
you transplant a squash seeds because

28
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,649
they are very sensitive to their roots

29
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,599
being disturbed 70 to 85 degrees

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,280
Fahrenheit is the ideal temperature for

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,839
them to germinate but they can germinate

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,728
at lower temperatures this will take

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,290
them a little bit longer this is why

34
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:15,000
typically when we're seeding the squash

35
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,850
field we wait a little bit later into

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,188
the season I'm to that May or the end of

37
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,500
May time frame because that soil has a

38
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:24,629
chance to warm up now when you're here

39
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,728
planting seeds if you're using Robie

40
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:28,530
block that is recommended they can go

41
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,569
down and kind of flame hole or punch a

42
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,129
hole is advised depending on what

43
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:35,699
varieties are growing will determine the

44
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:37,469
spacing see here a nice even spacing we

45
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,180
kind of white halos it's a little bit

46
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,129
late in the season these had a treatment

47
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,020
of surround a little heavy treatment at

48
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:45,859
that and that's why you see little halos

49
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,328
around each of the plants now how to

50
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:50,310
prevent you from constantly bending over

51
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:52,109
and planting each seed I have one person

52
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,090
go down a row with a large heavy metal

53
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:56,879
spike like this and kind of use that to

54
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,118
kind of punch a hole that's about that

55
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,009
inch or so deep to the soil the next

56
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,069
person will fall around with a three to

57
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,349
four foot pipe and they basically would

58
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,090
drop a couple seeds down there about

59
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,639
three and that would go right into the

60
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,050
whole third person comes through and

61
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,829
covers the hole up this is a very

62
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,540
efficient way

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,880
no one has to keep bending over and up

64
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,569
and down up and down to go through

65
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,879
implants

66
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:24,389
it could be a very large field of squash

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:28,680
or even pumpkin seeds now protection of

68
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:30,359
your newly emerging squash seeds early

69
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,870
season cucumber beetles can be a major

70
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,760
threat

71
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,379
so after seeding it's recommend you

72
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,840
cover the rows like it is here with

73
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,060
insect netting don't wait on this

74
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,219
because if you've gotten about and the

75
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,680
ceilings do emerge and cucumber beetles

76
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,990
have Oh hatch they can Lily wipe out

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,550
your small season's over one night so if

78
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,230
you see this here was this been recently

79
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,200
planted we see the drip tape lined up

80
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:55,280
covered sealed of all good to go here

81
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,689
and even treat the surround initially

82
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,729
lastly protecting your ceilings that

83
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:00,900
only from insects but also animals can

84
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:03,149
be a major issue

85
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,890
crows being number one they can pull

86
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,990
ceilings out of the ground they say to

87
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:08,969
get at the seed anything that it can

88
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,890
help protect from this threat you don't

89
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:12,449
have or go through the trouble of in

90
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,549
second and you can wrap a fishing line

91
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:16,679
in kind of a zigzag pattern and help

92
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,110
disturb the crows flight patterns or

93
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,300
also as a last resort if possible in

94
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,180
your area now you are able to are able

95
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,530
to point crows and you shoot one you can

96
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,500
hang it on the pole in the center of the

97
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,229
squash field and simply that one dead

98
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,169
crow hanging on a pole will take care of

99
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:36,238
any future Crow problems so again I know

100
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:40,250
it's not available in all areas what if

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,250
it is an option it one to consider
