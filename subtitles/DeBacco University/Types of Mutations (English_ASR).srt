1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,730
here we look at different types of

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,980
mutations that occur particularly

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,138
looking at DNA in the root causes of

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,960
some of these mutations and how they

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:15,419
look on the kind of the level of the

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,949
chromosome here we could see here amis

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,198
might be some point mutations here that

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,118
occurring see that these don't all quite

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,179
look 100% right we're going to go over a

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,879
little bit of that so starting with just

11
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,278
a mutation to genetic material can be

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,149
altered in two main ways it can be

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,750
recombined or the true mutation

14
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:35,850
recombination is a change in the

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,820
positioning of the genetic material and

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,469
a mutation is a change in the content of

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,509
the genetic material so it's important

18
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,670
to understand these two distinctions the

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,679
recombination is the positioning just

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,670
where they're physically located and if

21
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:52,469
an actual mutation is the content the

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,539
nucleotide sequences might be changed

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,149
here we have a change from an A to A C

24
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,189
an adenine to a cytosine and how that

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,439
changes our amino acid which can

26
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:05,099
negatively impact a protein that might

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,188
be made from there so mutation and

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,829
recombination provide raw material for

29
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:12,868
evolution so this is can be beneficial

30
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:14,519
evolution can be viewed as a selection

31
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:17,759
of particular combination of alleles

32
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,699
from a pool of alternatives mutations in

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,379
germline tissue can be inherited and

34
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,379
mutations in some somatic tissues are

35
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,060
not inherited so remember our somatic

36
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,578
cells are like our regular body cells

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,359
germ lines would be sperm or eggs up egg

38
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:35,639
cells somatic tissue mutations can't be

39
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,828
passed from one cell to its descendants

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,379
you're not going to get that from either

41
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:41,368
a parent because somatic is just a point

42
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:43,289
mutation it's going to affect the

43
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,450
individual potentially but not any of

44
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,250
their offspring the mutation in the

45
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,990
germline is what's going to affect the

46
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,500
offspring here it's important just to

47
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:54,030
make note of that types of mutations

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,759
again the patient's are caused two ways

49
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,909
errors in DNA replication by miss

50
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,209
pairing a base by DNA polymerase then we

51
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,070
could have a key bind together here we

52
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:08,159
have an T binding to a G and that's

53
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:10,530
causing a mutation that occurs or mutant

54
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,250
genes these are antigens that can damage

55
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,729
DNA

56
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,250
that can occur from UVB light here it's

57
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:21,099
the ultraviolet light sunrays have a lot

58
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,500
of this that can cause these types of

59
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:27,939
mutations that can cause these errors in

60
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,400
these sequences in the DNA the sequence

61
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:33,159
of DNA can be altered in one of two main

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,400
ways version is point mutations this is

63
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:39,520
an alteration one or a few bases a base

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,140
substitution insertion or deletion so

65
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,459
here we have no mutations within normal

66
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:47,319
DNA level B ttc a silent mutation is a

67
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:50,050
mutation that still occurs from ttc

68
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,509
people from TTT II when it does change

69
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,430
the mRNA level because of the

70
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:56,379
redundancies that occur the protein

71
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,900
level it's not changed this is why it's

72
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,669
called a silent mutation

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,879
there's also nonsense mutations where

74
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:05,469
TTC NAT turns into a T C this should

75
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,509
change the mRNA level and this causes a

76
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:09,430
stop codon this is gonna truncate or

77
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:11,319
reduce the length of the amino acid

78
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,330
sequence that will probably make the

79
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,579
protein non-functional then there's

80
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:19,510
missense we have conservative and

81
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:22,420
non-conservative TC c or another same

82
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:26,048
from RT t from are TTC and we're having

83
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:27,518
a change in the protein level now here

84
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:29,469
we're having this protein while it's

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,510
difficile acid should say well it's

86
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:34,030
different has similar properties to the

87
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:36,099
original a non-conservative here as a

88
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,169
very different amount of properties and

89
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,789
interactions so this is more like that a

90
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:42,789
negative impact and a conservative

91
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:44,099
mutation however this is the normal it

92
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:46,179
means this is what the cell wants

93
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,689
realize that there are things that can

94
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,209
occur point mutations that may cause

95
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:54,159
basically no visible change or no change

96
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,310
in the amino acid sequence others can

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,829
cause a change and ultimately if a stop

98
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,159
codon is encoded for that can really

99
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,599
cause a small protein to form and it

100
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,689
will probably not be able to produce its

101
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,489
function there's also a frameshift

102
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:11,049
mutation these are insertions or

103
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,610
deletions that throw off the reading

104
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:17,379
frame meaning we remember our codons and

105
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,329
normal reading are three codon sequences

106
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:19,930
are three nucleotide sequences and then

107
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:24,038
go ahead along

108
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,900
however he frameshift occurs she lysine

109
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:29,259
it should be you you

110
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:32,289
you he with you you and that use removed

111
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:34,240
we have this G coming in so you Yugi now

112
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,979
is encoding for a different amino acid

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,300
which is truncating our protein because

114
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:43,389
now a stop codon is reached so this you

115
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,210
AG is a stop codon we see up here you AG

116
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:49,418
is up here also but because we're

117
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:54,728
reading these distinctive three portion

118
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:58,240
codons it's not read as you AG as it's

119
00:04:54,728 --> 00:05:01,719
pictured here it's it's read as a UA and

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,490
in g ug and in CC g so it's very

121
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,800
important these frame shifts can really

122
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,689
cause negative effects it's because

123
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,060
we're reading in those three codon

124
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:11,829
sequences so by removing one with glue

125
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,689
to frame shift everything that falls

126
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:19,478
down in line to other ones transposition

127
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:21,189
we're moving the genes from one part of

128
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:23,109
the genome to another which is what this

129
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:25,240
is trying to show here splicing it out

130
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,759
right in here this could occur both in

131
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,829
eukaryotes and prokaryotes chromosomal

132
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,360
rearrangements or translocations as the

133
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:36,009
name implies you have translocated

134
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,660
translocated the genes it has change in

135
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,430
the position and/or the number of

136
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,710
segments in the chromosome in eukaryotes

137
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,900
so here we have a chromosome for

138
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,489
chromosome 20 well we're cutting off a

139
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,079
piece of chromosome 20 we're putting it

140
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,769
in chromosome 4 or chopping this piece

141
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:52,300
of chromosome 4 up that chromosome 20

142
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:55,418
essentially the DNA on the cellular

143
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,918
level is all the same but it's mixed up

144
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:58,689
now there's a reason why we have

145
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,269
chromosome flooring from some xx and the

146
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:03,009
genes that code for that cells gonna go

147
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:04,870
looking for those particular proteins in

148
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,490
those chromosomes and now that they've

149
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,788
been moved that's gonna cause negative

150
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,740
effects to occur

151
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:14,529
x 2 mutations a deletion as it as it

152
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,658
would imply that is simply the loss of a

153
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:19,619
portion of chromosome indicated here has

154
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:21,279
lost it duplication and extra copy of

155
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,709
part of the chromosome

156
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,119
we're just duplicating it we have two

157
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:27,549
copies now instead of just one that you

158
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,519
should have inversions is the reverse

159
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,050
direction so we're taking our DNA

160
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,490
sequence and reversing it flipping it

161
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,250
over that's going to cause some name of

162
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,199
the facts insertions talk about

163
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,069
additional portion of a chromosome is

164
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,319
attached to another

165
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,300
and then translocation part of one

166
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,710
chromosome attaches to another so

167
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,718
insertion or just inserting something

168
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:50,038
where it shouldn't belong translocation

169
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:52,718
were moving it to different genes

170
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:54,068
how this may look this is the reference

171
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:57,338
sequence looking at this a very specific

172
00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:00,218
region right here it should read ABCD

173
00:06:57,338 --> 00:07:04,088
very common if the deletion would look

174
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:08,379
like a CD or missing the B inversion of

175
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:10,509
the B sequence because a C the D so we

176
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:14,999
notice that the B and the C is inverted

177
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:21,669
here's a duplication a b c d two B's in

178
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:23,649
multiple copies a ABA CB CB e CD causing

179
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:25,838
all sorts of weird mutations all

180
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,879
different than the reference sequence

181
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:30,360
here and all could lead to negative a

182
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,559
sex by the cell and ultimately organism

183
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,598
will causes these mutations there's a

184
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:36,459
whole host of potential regions root

185
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,829
reasons for this could be UV radiation

186
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:42,069
cigarette smoke could be virus induced

187
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:44,800
in some cases on certain ingredients in

188
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:47,588
products x-rays can cause us so it's not

189
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,538
just one source the main categories are

190
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:53,168
radiation chemicals infectious agents

191
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,748
mutations smoking and lung cancer

192
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:58,348
there's a label that write on cigarettes

193
00:07:55,749 --> 00:08:01,949
here agents that cause cancer are called

194
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:03,819
carcinogens there are typically mutants

195
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:06,939
hypothesis is that chemicals cause

196
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:09,639
cancer was first advanced in the 18th

197
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:11,050
century meaning in investigation since

198
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,028
then have determined that chemicals can

199
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,009
cause cancer in both animals and humans

200
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:17,050
the tars and other chemicals in

201
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:20,740
cigarette smoke is a prime example of

202
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:24,418
this leading causes of death in 2014 for

203
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,430
males and females from very similar

204
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:29,109
causes in both males and females however

205
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,478
heart disease is a little higher in

206
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,099
males and it is females and fervent

207
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,078
cancers also a little higher in males

208
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,690
than females but this gives you an idea

209
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:39,968
that heart disease and cancer I'll high

210
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,659
percentage of the causes of death from

211
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:46,260
2014 that's good too morbid kind of

212
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:51,159
ranking the top 10 causes of death for

213
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:52,840
2014 and 2013 we notice here diseases of

214
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:56,139
the heart being number one

215
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,370
malignant neoplasms number two and

216
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:59,860
there's just seem to be getting drop-off

217
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,679
for number four other lower respiratory

218
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,200
diseases accidents here and so on and so

219
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:08,919
forth so we could see here heart disease

220
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,550
very common most likely cause of death

221
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:14,559
from the 2014 data that's will hold up

222
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:15,729
here so for that wasn't too morbid that

223
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,829
gives you a little bit of background on

224
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,210
what mutations are and what negative

225
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,210
effects they may occur
