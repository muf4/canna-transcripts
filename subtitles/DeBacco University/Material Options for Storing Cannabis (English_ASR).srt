1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,279
hopefully you've made it through a

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,520
successful growing operation

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,119
you've had a good drying process you've

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,678
cured all your cannabis buds

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,800
now you're looking for storage and now

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,880
you're realizing there's a lot of

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,320
material options for properly storing

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,000
your cannabis buds

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,760
well here at tobacco university we're

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
going to give you some advantages and

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
disadvantages of some common materials

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,839
so you can make an informed decision

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,399
so you can have the best long-term

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:31,839
storage for what you've worked so hard

15
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,839
to grow and produce

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,359
[Music]

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,679
all right let's get into material

18
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,119
options for storing cannabis

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,719
so first off you want to keep the

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,079
environmental conditions optimum

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,920
regardless of what material you're

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,000
actually choosing

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,359
regardless of area jews environment is

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,119
still important and those environmental

25
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,039
conditions are important to monitor

26
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,159
to help maximize the storing of your

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,120
cannabis while

28
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,799
also maintaining a high quality now it

29
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,078
can be a very

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,919
high-end regulated kind of canadore

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,519
product here or it can be just the

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,439
environmental conditions that's being

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,080
stored and does not have to be

34
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,000
super high-end can be large scale but

35
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,158
keeping it monitored and regulated is

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,519
very important now there are different

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,920
material options you can think of it

38
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,200
like

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,359
different material options for water

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,719
bottles cannabis can be properly stored

41
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,719
in a number of different materials

42
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,560
not just one correct material each

43
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,000
material does have its own advantages as

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,359
well as disadvantages

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,519
that a grower must recognize to

46
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,239
determine the best fit for their given

47
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,438
situation

48
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,280
and here in this video i am going to

49
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,319
provide you with a host of options

50
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,400
as well as the advantages and

51
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,078
disadvantages to allow you to make that

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,640
informed decision

53
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,478
so first off storing canvas in glass

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,200
these are typically easy to acquire

55
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,920
and commonly used for display as well as

56
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,759
storage

57
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,439
mason jars are the industry standard but

58
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,000
there are other options that can be

59
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,000
larger or smaller but the ball mason

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,959
jars is probably the gold standard we

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,799
can get the

62
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,399
lids uh you can buy new lids so they can

63
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,360
steel up really nice it's really easy to

64
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,799
acquire these

65
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,718
this is probably considered to be

66
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,600
probably one of the more common options

67
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,199
now why is it more common option well

68
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,598
the glass itself is inert

69
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,640
it's very hard it's not biodegradable so

70
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,919
it makes the

71
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,598
glass material advantageous however most

72
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,439
are clear which would require a dark

73
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,399
environment for storage so just keep

74
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,919
that in mind

75
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,599
there are different colors but also

76
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,318
present similar challenges as clears are

77
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,560
still letting

78
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,679
light in so while the material itself

79
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,520
has a great advantages

80
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
because it is clear they should be

81
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
stored in a dark environment not

82
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,560
necessarily hard to do but something to

83
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,080
keep in mind if you're selecting this as

84
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,840
your option

85
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
so others will look at what's called a

86
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,519
violet glass to basically store the

87
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
cannabis buds and violence glass blocks

88
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,959
visible light

89
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,719
with the exception of the color violet

90
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,280
so we can see here let's some light in

91
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,120
but a lot of visible light is reflected

92
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,039
it's semiprimal depends on the specific

93
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,519
glass type as well as the thickness

94
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,519
to uva and infrared light allowing about

95
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,039
40 to 60 percent to penetrate

96
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,560
and so keep that in mind that you are

97
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,799
getting some degree of penetration

98
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,158
but it is a lot less than clear glass

99
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,239
for example

100
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,598
so the advantages of selecting this type

101
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,400
would be it does limit to light

102
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,158
penetration

103
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,319
can help protect bud quality over clear

104
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:10,959
materials the downfalls wavelengths

105
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,598
filtered

106
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,239
may be low exposure to buds anyway and

107
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,598
this can be

108
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,200
also difficult material to acquire

109
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,959
so at least this is storing in stainless

110
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,799
steel as we can see right here

111
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,080
many cooking safe containers can easily

112
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,439
be used for storing buds these

113
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
containers offer great storage

114
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,598
conditions

115
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
this material is less likely to become

116
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,039
damaged compared to glass

117
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,878
so there's again some of the benefits

118
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,560
and pretty easy to acquire and easy to

119
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,199
seal up as well

120
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,158
so reason why someone would use the

121
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,280
stainless steel

122
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,798
was it it is an inert material seals the

123
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
bud environment from the outside

124
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,959
and offers the ability to block light

125
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,560
the downfall is it can be heavy

126
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,319
and they come in limited sizes and

127
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
shapes which could impact

128
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,878
storage depending on how much room you

129
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,200
have for adequate storage

130
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,878
then that leads us to storing in plastic

131
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,399
so cannabis can degrade in plastic

132
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,679
containers

133
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,360
can often allow for easy stacking though

134
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,120
plastic materials can have great degree

135
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,239
of variability meaning you can have

136
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
plastic bags

137
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,519
or you can have plastic buckets or

138
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,519
containers

139
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,120
now storing cannabis in plastic the

140
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,478
advantage is that it's really easy to

141
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,519
acquire very easy to get

142
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,199
um as bags or buckets or bins it's not

143
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,199
likely to become damaged because it is

144
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,478
rigid however the disadvantages it can

145
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
lead to degradation of the buds

146
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:26,639
particularly for really long-term

147
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,399
storage

148
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,240
which is why a lot of growers choose not

149
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,478
to use plastic

150
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,160
it can be good to be used in a pinch can

151
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:34,800
be good for short-term operations as

152
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
well

153
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,840
so keep these in mind when looking at

154
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,360
selecting your material so you can

155
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,478
select material that's the best fit for

156
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,120
your situation

157
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,599
to allow the longest storage uh of your

158
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,519
buds

159
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,759
and keep in mind that the environment is

160
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:52,159
also important as well as materials

161
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,160
you select actually store your buds in
