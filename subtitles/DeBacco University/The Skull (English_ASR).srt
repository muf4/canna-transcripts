1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
looking at the title it should come as

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,179
no surprise at this video lecture series

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,769
will cover the skull we're gonna be

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,419
identifying some of the bones within the

5
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:12,928
skull and also some of the functions

6
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:14,519
that this allows us to have so

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,440
specifically the skull what does it do

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,160
well some of its functions is protection

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,109
eye protects the brain in particular it

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,179
also acts as an entrance for the

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,970
respiratory system and also the

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,349
digestive system there's 22 bones or now

13
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,820
I'm not going to make you memorize them

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,589
all I'm going to present them all to you

15
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,030
and even a couple more in some greater

16
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,280
detail but on the highlight some of the

17
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,630
key ones that I want you to know we

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,359
can't forget within the skull there's

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,280
also something called sinus cavities the

20
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,558
goal of these is it decrease the weight

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,660
of the skull and they're also lined with

22
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:48,359
mucous membranes and they protect the

23
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,648
entrance to the respiratory system so

24
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,269
we've covered the respiratory system it

25
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,390
comes back a little bit to the sciences

26
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,359
and the entrance point here is in the

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,549
skull so there's two sets of bones we

28
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,859
have our cranium and our facial bones

29
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,299
and the bones are joined by what's

30
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,728
called a sutures and you kind of see

31
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,219
them here as we're rotating around only

32
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,799
the mandible is attached by a freely

33
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,868
movable joint remember the mandible is

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,380
this portion right here this is our

35
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:19,228
mandible highlighted in green in this

36
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:21,359
image here and the skull bones here of

37
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:24,000
the cranium are kind of sutured or

38
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:28,469
stitched away think about it together

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,500
here so of the cranial bones just highly

40
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:35,000
the couple here are occipital or

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,250
temporal or parental frontal and

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,170
stephannie leg bone so we have these

43
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,530
different bone regions which should be

44
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,140
able to identify these now this is one

45
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,079
orientation of the skull as you'll see

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,478
in other slides and images these same

47
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,819
bones may appear but we may have a

48
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,218
different view of the skull so it's

49
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,669
important to identify these bones based

50
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:01,709
on different orientations of the skull

51
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,180
here's the 14 facial bones now you may

52
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:05,279
count these up initially and the same

53
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,229
thing goes right here say there's not a

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,209
listed here there's not 14 listed here

55
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:10,919
well remember that some are there's

56
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,560
actually two of them for example there's

57
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,919
two nasal bones or just going to look at

58
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,780
the

59
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,659
- I want you to be able to identify

60
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,550
right here then mandible as I mentioned

61
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,379
just kind of the lower jaw and the

62
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,140
maxilla there's two of them on the left

63
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,989
and right side but I want to lose is the

64
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,848
maxilla bones and this is the mandible

65
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:33,989
being able to distinguish the difference

66
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:36,060
between these is important inferior view

67
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,580
of the skull so remember back from some

68
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,420
of our anatomical positions inferior

69
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,019
view we're looking kind of from the

70
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:46,469
bottom up and we see that and then here

71
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,450
with the maxilla here here's our

72
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:49,800
temporal bone where it's located here's

73
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:53,099
our occipital bone here

74
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,600
from the inferior review so there's a

75
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,030
lot of other bones I'm not going to get

76
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,519
into but we're kind of keeping track of

77
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,239
these two in particular from a different

78
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,129
viewpoint so we have here's another

79
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,810
viewpoint superior view this is from

80
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:09,269
kind of the top looking straight down on

81
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,729
the frontal bone here the temporal bone

82
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:15,840
the parental bone in the occipital bone

83
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:17,068
again from the superior view again don't

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,629
focus on the ones that I didn't

85
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:21,539
highlight at least for the purposes of

86
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,400
my class but you can see the degree of

87
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:26,659
complexity that occurred within a

88
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,069
relatively small region called the skull

89
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:31,289
paranasal sinuses these are hollow

90
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,849
portions of Bones surrounding the nasal

91
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:35,849
cavity you can see where they're located

92
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:38,310
you may have sinus pressure and that's

93
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,229
usually because of the sinuses that are

94
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,019
located right within the front of your

95
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:44,488
skull there for my purposes in Beckenham

96
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,189
you can learn all the different science

97
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,539
sinuses by name that could make sense

98
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:51,180
that the frontal is kind of near the

99
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:53,099
frontal bone the maxillary sinuses were

100
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,519
that maxilla bone is so you could see

101
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,680
that there's names to intervene late the

102
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,719
functions of these sinus cavities are

103
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,510
delighting the skull and they also give

104
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,759
resonance and amplification to the two

105
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,318
voice so because they're hollow it's a

106
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,629
loud voice to kind of resonate and

107
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:10,828
amplify a little bit better again from

108
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:12,180
my purpose is not going to make you

109
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:14,370
learn them all but you can see where

110
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,709
they're located so particularly if you

111
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,489
have allergies or sinus pressure

112
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,728
depending where it's located

113
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:23,129
maybe it'll identify the specific name

114
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:25,990
of the sciences that is has pressure or

115
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:28,269
might be inflamed

116
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,300
the hyoid bone this is an important bone

117
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:33,099
that kind of be able to identify it's

118
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,199
the only bone that does not articulate

119
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,090
with another bone as you see here in our

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,889
slowly worked in a skeleton kind of see

121
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:40,629
it's like it's floating unless because

122
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,430
it isn't articulate with any other bone

123
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,889
and this is true for the entire body

124
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,139
here this is the only one that's kind of

125
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:49,538
like free-floating it serves as a

126
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,060
moveable base for the tongue so that's

127
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:54,310
its purpose how do you begin and idea

128
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,430
where that is located about right here

129
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,209
it's the only one does not articulate in

130
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,228
the entire body

131
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:05,348
with another bone ah the fetal skull the

132
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:08,319
fuel skull is large compared to the

133
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:10,418
infant's total body length so if I see

134
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,639
in this image here in the amber seven

135
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:14,978
weeks after conception there's kind of a

136
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,228
disproportionality here the fetal skull

137
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:19,569
is large in relation to the rest of the

138
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:20,829
body length this is one thing that's a

139
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,079
little bit different though that that

140
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:25,269
fetal level you're having that change or

141
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,969
that disproportionality of the skull

142
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:30,310
being slightly larger in proportion to

143
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,199
the rest of the body now this individual

144
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,538
continues to grow and develop and become

145
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,509
more proportional but initially at the

146
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:39,509
fetal stage the skull is actually

147
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:41,889
disproportionate to the body weight

148
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,960
lastly remember one of the previous

149
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:46,180
lectures talked about fontanelles these

150
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,310
are those fibrous membranes connecting

151
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,319
the cranial bones they allow the brain

152
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,870
of the brain to grow and they convert to

153
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,668
bone within 24 months after birth these

154
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,649
are the soft spots on the baby's head

155
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:58,478
you can see a graph here of the

156
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:01,508
percentage of infants with open

157
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:05,050
fontanelles over time our massive

158
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:07,240
decrease from 3 months old to 24 months

159
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,550
old or 2 years old and we can see that

160
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,250
de Gration that mean time for closure of

161
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,379
the anterior fontanelle so after about 2

162
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,800
years in most cases is always one case

163
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:20,110
here in most cases by two years after

164
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,240
birth 24 months these fundamentals have

165
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,240
closed up and if we come ossified
