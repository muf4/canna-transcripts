1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,658
so when we look at plants were PI very

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,639
familiar with the stems and the roots

3
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:07,859
and the leaves but we also have to

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,500
consider and also remember the major

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,120
plant cell components so of those plant

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,370
cells what does each one of those

7
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,410
individual cells what are they made out

8
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,570
of what do they contain well they

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,460
contain a nucleus on this controls the

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,890
cells actions is often refer to as the

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,140
command center of the cell contains most

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,730
of the DNA you know the mitochondria and

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,500
chloroplasts to have some of their own

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,640
unique DNA this would be the vast

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:35,159
majority of the DNA inside we or on the

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,230
outside I should say of the nucleus we

17
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,569
have the nuclear envelope there's

18
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:41,669
nuclear pores here that regulate what

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,230
can come in welcome come out because

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,460
this is the command center it's very

21
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:47,609
important the cell keeps this

22
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:52,020
information protected the mitochondria

23
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:54,000
this is the site where food is converted

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,789
into energy through the process of

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,460
cellular respiration it does contain

26
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,379
some of its own unique DNA and it's the

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,808
site specifically what we call ATP

28
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:06,209
synthesis then assume triphosphates the

29
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:09,209
energy currency of the cell this is the

30
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:11,759
main site where it is synthesized or

31
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:13,709
made to say it's the powerhouse of the

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,500
cell is where they students will tell me

33
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:19,109
it is it's not really a proper reference

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,090
to its function the synthesis of ATP is

35
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,640
a much more accurate description of what

36
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,770
this organelle does the chloroplasts

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,540
contain the green pigment that's it's

38
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:30,840
called the chlorophyll that capture

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,118
light for photosynthesis also contains

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,680
some of its own unique DNA there's a

41
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,599
high concentration of chloroplasts give

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,400
the plants this green color we may

43
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,009
notice here in New England in the fall

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,079
plants lose their some trees lose their

45
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,519
green color and will start to turn

46
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,639
different colors and that's as a result

47
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,929
the breakdown of the chlorophyll which

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,820
is located in the chloroplast there's

49
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,149
also some other pigments but chlorophyll

50
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,489
is the most dominant the vacuoles see

51
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,560
here has a large shaft it contains water

52
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,390
stored food salts pigments and other

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,700
waste products it can take up the

54
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,250
majority of the volume of the cell so it

55
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,909
can vary but it can take almost up to

56
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,860
about 90% of the cell ribosomes are the

57
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,439
site of protein synthesis it's where

58
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,420
amino acids are linked together

59
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,729
is ribosomes are these complex here we

60
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,079
can see one indicated here we're not

61
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:21,539
going into two mentions in the protein

62
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,100
synthesis pathway but it's where all the

63
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,560
amino acids are linked together to form

64
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,389
polypeptides also known as proteins

65
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,449
specific types of proteins that would be

66
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:32,399
an example being enzyme the endoplasmic

67
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:34,259
reticulum or er contains these

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,080
interconnected network of membrane

69
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,239
includes two black structures there's

70
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,760
rough ER which has a rebus odin's kind

71
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,340
of put on top here kind of studded on

72
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:48,120
top and we have smooth ER which is more

73
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,050
the site of lipid or fat synthesis Golgi

74
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,840
bodies are the site of protein

75
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,130
processing storage and modification you

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,659
can see here's our nucleus here's our

77
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:56,069
rough ER and then we would go to the

78
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,870
Golgi apparatus

79
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,750
this tends to be one of the more

80
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,909
finishing bodies where kind of were

81
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,039
modifying those proteins that may have

82
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,060
been produced from the rough ER and is

83
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,280
tweaking them before they may be

84
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,099
released outside the cell or put into

85
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,259
the cell membrane the cell memory

86
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,609
specifically is also known as a plasma

87
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,159
membrane it's what's called a

88
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,230
phospholipid bilayer there is a

89
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,109
phospholipid there is a bilayer English

90
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:23,909
two layers this together helps the cell

91
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,270
regulate what can enter and exit the

92
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:29,819
cell causing on this semi permeable

93
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:33,300
layer it's present in both plant and

94
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,189
animal cells the cell wall is only

95
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,410
present in plant cells so the cell

96
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:40,530
membrane platon animal cell well only

97
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:43,139
plant cells we see here onion cells and

98
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,659
the root tips in particular cell walls

99
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,399
are composed mainly of cellulose steel

100
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,680
this is a complex sugar molecule giving

101
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,480
a lot of strength and rigidity after the

102
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,209
cell stops growing this the wall will

103
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:56,189
thicken and become rigid and it's not

104
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,689
present in animal cells so that kind of

105
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:00,150
gives these kind of this until almost

106
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:02,459
blocks like look appearance it's the

107
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,069
formation of that thick and rigid cell

108
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,240
wall when a plant cell reaches the point

109
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,239
of maturation
