1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
so while all the animals pictured here

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,859
have a closed circulatory system the

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,119
each have their own different variations

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,730
that we're going to go into in a little

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,669
bit more detail here at how they move

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,870
blood through their bodies so I'm gonna

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:18,269
start with a couple comparisons that

8
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:19,528
most might seem initially confusing but

9
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,589
I am going to go through each and more

10
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,990
detail focus on each specifically here

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:27,480
we're comparing a fish to named Vivian

12
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:29,939
so a fish had the simplest circulatory

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,700
system of all the vertebrates

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,350
their blood flows one direction and from

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,450
a two chambered heart through the gills

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,760
and then to the rest of the body so in

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,690
all the images we start at the heart

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,699
looking at we're leaving the heart we're

19
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,199
going to the gills where we're having

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,960
that exchange of carbon dioxide and

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,550
oxygen that oxygenated blood isn't going

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,189
to the blood capillaries meaning back

23
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,378
here going through the heart going back

24
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,839
through the system here so it's a two

25
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,628
chamber heart and it's just kind of that

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,620
one direction going toward Ian's phibian

27
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:03,628
Sal they have two ways or two routes

28
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:05,819
that through blood can take one for

29
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:08,489
oxygenating blood through the lungs in

30
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,129
skin and the other to take oxygen to the

31
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:13,109
rest of the body the blood is pumped

32
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,780
through a three chambered heart with two

33
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:18,420
atria and the single ventricle so we see

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,159
here blood is pumped through a three

35
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,460
chamber heart with two atria there's one

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,290
located here this single ventricle and

37
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,569
here's our blood leaving going through

38
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,689
the lungs or the skin capillaries

39
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:33,719
becoming oxygenated returning back to

40
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:35,489
the heart here and then leaving and

41
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,129
being pumped here through the body now

42
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,539
the reason why this did not as is an

43
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:42,349
improvement from our two chambered heart

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,930
is we're now having blood returning to

45
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:47,578
the heart in distinctive areas so that

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,649
is going necessarily in one direction

47
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,419
you see already that's more complicated

48
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,519
but the fact that there's only one

49
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,140
ventricle means here a blood could be

50
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,609
going back to the lungs or could be

51
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,409
going out to the body so it's not

52
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:03,299
necessarily as efficient as it could be

53
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:06,240
comparing the reptile in the mammals of

54
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,310
reptiles have two secretory routes the

55
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,489
blood is only oxygen through the lungs

56
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,469
because there's no skin contact with the

57
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,860
environment the heart is also a three

58
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:15,990
chamber

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,120
Desai Karan pipiens but the ventricles

60
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,730
are partially separated so the mixing of

61
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,969
oxygenated and deoxygenated blood

62
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:26,280
kurz accepting crocodilians are slightly

63
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:27,750
different category there but the reason

64
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,270
or the downfall that we're seeing here

65
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,330
is Purple's is representing kind of our

66
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,740
partly deoxygenated blood and we're

67
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,290
noticing that in me that's mixing the

68
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,780
curd so here's our oxygenated blood

69
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:41,340
returning it's kind of mixing with our

70
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,830
deoxygenated blood making this kind of

71
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,090
in-between intermediate kind of

72
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,040
partially actually it partially

73
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,860
deactivated and that's being circulated

74
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:53,280
through the most efficient way here's

75
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,620
our mammals and they have four chamber

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,409
heart that's completely separating out

77
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,300
oxygenated and deoxygenated blood it

78
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,400
pumps only australian blood through the

79
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,370
body and deoxygenated blood to the lungs

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,730
so here's our blue deactivated blood

81
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,200
going to our lungs being oxygenated

82
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:12,929
turning to a separate portion of the

83
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,419
heart that is in being exited out and

84
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,400
goes to the body so this is the most

85
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,469
efficient this for chamber hurt because

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,780
it's allowing that complete separation

87
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:23,879
between deoxygenated and oxygenated

88
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,939
blood let's look at these hearts a

89
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,439
little bit more detail so first off that

90
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,090
two chambered heart for the fish it's

91
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,219
one atrium one ventricle single

92
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,610
circulatory root reptiles or amphibians

93
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:37,169
have a three chambered heart they double

94
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,450
the amount of a trio but still remain

95
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,669
only with one ventricle remember

96
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:43,189
ventricles pump is the portion of the

97
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:45,479
heart pumping it to the rest of the body

98
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,979
the reason why this is not quite as

99
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,629
efficient because we have both

100
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:50,159
oxygenated and deoxygenated blood being

101
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:53,310
mixed through a double so they take

102
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,780
circulatory process mammals have the

103
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,610
four chambered heart the most efficient

104
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,069
the two atria two ventricles

105
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,080
we're both oxygenated Indian blood are

106
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:04,229
separate and this is also double

107
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,430
circulated Strait circulation looking a

108
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,689
little more specifically at the

109
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,819
simplicity of the fish it's a two

110
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:14,039
chamber heart the single atrium receives

111
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,259
blood from the body cells a ventricle

112
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,120
sends blood to the gills so here's our

113
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,399
direction the blood flow we kind of have

114
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,348
this one way that the heart's just kind

115
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,788
of pumping going out here to the gills

116
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:25,829
and kind of working its way right back

117
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:27,729
around so simplest of all the

118
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:30,849
vertebrates to chamber heart

119
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:33,580
fish three chambered heart separated out

120
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,129
allows some separation of oxygen and

121
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:38,139
deoxygenated blood which is an advantage

122
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:41,110
on land organisms such as reptiles and

123
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:44,199
amphibians though the blood can mix in

124
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,939
the ventricle mixing is minimal some

125
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,909
reptiles have partial separation of the

126
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:50,800
ventricle so kind of that first step of

127
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,080
having that separation of that

128
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,939
deoxygenated in oxygenated blood and we

129
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,519
see that here is our flow of blood

130
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:59,920
here's the body we have that mix and of

131
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,000
courage before it's being sent out I'll

132
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,280
provide you with a nice cross-section

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,319
here was also labeling of all the

134
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,679
different portions of this three

135
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:11,740
chambered heart moving on to our four

136
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,379
chambered heart seen in mammals and

137
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,120
birds and this allows for a complete

138
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:18,639
separation of oxygenated and

139
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,680
deoxygenated blood this complete

140
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,569
separation allows for fast metabolism

141
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,550
found in human terms

142
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,800
those are organisms that are able to

143
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,730
maintain their own body temperature now

144
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,710
we are getting a little bit more

145
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,379
complicated we see that with our four

146
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:34,839
chambers two atria two ventricles they

147
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,029
have valves here separating out and a

148
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,069
separate physical separation here

149
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:42,189
allowing for oxygenated and deoxygenated

150
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:44,110
blood to be distinct and separate and

151
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:47,980
remember Dee actually blood is shown in

152
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,740
blue here even though in the body weeds

153
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,480
varying shades of red but that Dee

154
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,879
actually blood is sent directly to the

155
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,490
lungs it comes back as oxygenated blood

156
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,469
it's kept distinct and separate before

157
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,750
it's sent out through the body where

158
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,310
it's going through capillaries and then

159
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,089
the deoxygenated blood is then returning

160
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,089
back to the heart
