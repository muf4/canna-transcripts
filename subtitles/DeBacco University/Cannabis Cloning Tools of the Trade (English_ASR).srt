1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,799
okay we are going through and thinking

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,359
about cloning can this plant there are

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,069
certain tools of the trade that you need

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,259
to be aware of if you want to use the

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,610
right tool for the right job and here's

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,830
a couple outlines here that I'm going to

7
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,570
go into a little bit of detail lasso

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,100
healthy mother plant sharp knife reading

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,109
hormone media sterile solution

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,660
sterilization solution high humidity

11
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,400
lights and clean conditions are all

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,420
things you want to have in place if

13
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,390
you're going to go through the cloning

14
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,279
process so starting first with a healthy

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,320
mother plant so healthy mother plants

16
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,149
are very important if the stock plant is

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,520
in poor health that will directly result

18
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,870
in poor clones and can reduce the

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,430
percentage that will actually root

20
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,009
remember cutting us to go in a

21
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,869
high-stress environment so we wanted to

22
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,488
ensure that it produces roots that it

23
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,369
needs we need the mother plant of the

24
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:49,378
stock plant here to be in peak health so

25
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,968
that this dress that the clones or the

26
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,159
tips are going to go through although

27
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,170
able to not only survive that let go

28
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,259
through and actually produce roots and a

29
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,939
healthy subsequent plant

30
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:01,259
neither sharp knife so provides a clean

31
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,390
cut to allow for efficient water

32
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,429
transport scissors are not advised since

33
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,290
this will crush the vascular system so

34
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,180
it can be a sharp pocketknife doesn't

35
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,710
have to necessarily be a scalpel but

36
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,830
think about if you put flowers in a vase

37
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:16,438
when a nice clean cut to allow water to

38
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:19,219
transpire through and easily enter the

39
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:21,359
inner vascular system of the plant

40
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:23,759
breeding hormone it could be a gel or

41
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,829
powder that contains oxygen clinics gels

42
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,500
the best I personally is we can see kind

43
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,030
of an evident here these two boot nodes

44
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,590
have gotten treated with clinics and

45
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,420
gels you can see the large roots and

46
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,969
then these have not associated the

47
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,769
presence of roots here and here but not

48
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,658
nearly to the extent of those that were

49
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:41,849
treated with the hormone so yes hormones

50
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,299
can have a great impact increasing the

51
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,709
ability for a plant to root media often

52
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,079
rockville because there's other options

53
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:52,379
such as growing media can be just as

54
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:54,508
effective for cloning adding Heat and

55
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,179
that can help ensure or encourage the

56
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,618
rooting in the root zone environment so

57
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,140
they see some cubes here you see that

58
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,790
Rockville's kind of made out of that

59
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,500
almost spongy like material the only

60
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,390
little heat mat can help increase the

61
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,770
heat to some extent of the root zone

62
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,120
encouraging a quicker rooting process a

63
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,890
sterilization solution the isopropyl

64
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,539
alcohol is one example

65
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,539
and to keep every part of the process

66
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,129
clean and disease free as possible so

67
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,799
cleaning tools such as the knife is

68
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,079
important and to repeat so that the odds

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,250
of transferring disease is reduced what

70
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,480
this means is you want these clean

71
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,370
sterile conditions for the entire

72
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,349
process don't clean the knife at the

73
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,930
beginning take a bunch of clothes from

74
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,219
20 different plants and then clean that

75
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,930
knife at the end I'm going to be

76
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:38,639
repeating the cleaning process the

77
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,170
sterilization process in between maybe

78
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,059
different plants or even if you're

79
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:43,469
working at a large plant even as you

80
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,240
take multiple cuttings go through that

81
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:47,520
process again to reduce your chance of

82
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,500
spreading disease high humidity

83
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,930
environment humidity dome or chamber can

84
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,639
be done this reduces the stress on the

85
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,349
recent cutting so you can see how

86
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,389
they're looking here that nice humidity

87
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:58,919
dome there being second media here

88
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,019
they're under a lot of stress he lack

89
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,269
roots that high humidity will help

90
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,420
prevent or reduce the chance of these

91
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,610
plants burning the lights to use they

92
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,738
should be running 18 to 24 hours if

93
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,390
fluorescents are often preferred by some

94
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,360
did their soft light and low heat

95
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,699
generation CAMHS or Cermak metal halides

96
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,370
can be used disease can cover the same

97
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,629
area as a fluorescent but require only

98
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,670
one bulb and last longer than

99
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:25,769
fluorescence LEDs can also be

100
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,649
well-suited full-spectrum their low heat

101
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,939
low power consumption which is great but

102
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,189
for this purpose it can be cost

103
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:35,340
prohibitive as a result most people

104
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:38,009
using fluorescence circular halide kind

105
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,310
of replacing those and LEDs would be

106
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:43,829
great but often too expensive to justify

107
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,680
for this process we want clean

108
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,760
conditions this is a very important part

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,560
regardless of the entire process that

110
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,719
does the knife in sterilization of that

111
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,909
you want clean conditions overall this

112
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,129
is often underestimated because the high

113
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,989
plant density if one plant gets sick it

114
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,150
can quickly spread to other plants

115
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,129
clean the area before during and after

116
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,900
cloning it's great and you want to make

117
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:06,090
sure again that the tray is the media

118
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,719
the tags the areas are placed in

119
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,079
infinity domes everything is clean

120
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:14,189
ideally close to sterile as possible

121
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,840
tools of the trade a quick summary again

122
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,269
a healthy mother plant very important

123
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,079
that sharp clean knife rooting hormone a

124
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,509
gel or powder

125
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,728
media often Rockwell but other options

126
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:25,800
sterilization solution clean conditions

127
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:27,750
at high humidity and some form of

128
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,520
lighting run at 18 to 20

129
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,350
four hours hopefully this will help you

130
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,359
work through and know they have the

131
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,360
proper tools in the trade for cloning
