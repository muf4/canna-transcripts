1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,639
here on this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,878
we're going to go over the distillation

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,878
of cannabis to produce an extract

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,880
[Music]

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,559
so while it may look like there's a lot

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,599
of equipment here and there is and

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,759
there's a lot of little

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,720
degrees of specialization this is a very

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,720
popular method

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,839
used for cannabis extraction so we're

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,000
going to go over using

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,759
the this distillation process for

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,238
cannabis extraction and why

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,239
despite its complexities it's utilized

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,439
at such a large scale

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,759
so first off what's the general

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,280
description of the distillation

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,079
process and again there's going to be

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,840
some differences depending exactly

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,200
the process that you may look at but

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600
they're all going to have the same

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
basics the distillation method is going

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,079
to be using the solvent extraction

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,199
method in a

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,960
distillation kit extraction of the

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,238
desired plant material until you have

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,719
all the cannabinoids

28
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,519
terpenes and flavonoids collected in one

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,079
mixture

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,280
this material must go through

31
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,000
decarboxylation and also winterization

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,359
steps

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,799
you'll see a lot of these kind of

34
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,079
distillation areas a lot of these

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,320
receiving flasks

36
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,118
so there's a lot of necessarily moving

37
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,798
parts

38
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,040
a lot of components that are required as

39
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
part of this using a precise heating

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,799
element to the material is heated to the

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,118
max of 315 degrees fahrenheit

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,320
to boil off the terpenes and flavonoids

43
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:23,759
the resulting steam

44
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,079
is then pushed through a series of

45
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,879
cooling tubes where it's condensed back

46
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,840
into just

47
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,280
the desired flavonoid terpene mixture so

48
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,359
temperature regulation

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,400
temperature moderation all very

50
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,118
important because that's going to

51
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,159
determine

52
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,920
exactly how you collect everything now

53
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,200
they continue to raise the temperature

54
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,478
to boil off the cannabinoids so you're

55
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
kind of going through this distillation

56
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,679
you're pulling off one thing

57
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,199
next thing next thing so you continue to

58
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,159
raise the temperature to boil off the

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,640
cannabinoids

60
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,280
the cannabinoid steam is then cooled via

61
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,200
cooling

62
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,478
cooling tubes and condensed into highly

63
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,439
potent distilled

64
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,359
cannabis oil resulting two mixtures are

65
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,639
then combined to create the end product

66
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,920
which is typically thc the

67
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,878
thc to distillate now there is

68
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,800
a lot of simplified versions here we saw

69
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,479
before there's a lot of other machines a

70
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,080
lot of other separation methods

71
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,840
this is kind of a simplified version

72
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,640
here however

73
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
one necessary component is usually what

74
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,359
we see here

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,879
we see this right here is called a

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
rotary evaporator

77
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,639
and this rotary evaporator receives the

78
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,238
solvent that was used to extract the

79
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,639
cannabinoids from the flower

80
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,878
and heats off the solvent often ethanol

81
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,878
based and leaves the crude oil waiting

82
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,079
for the decarboxylation step

83
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,399
and we can see here temperature

84
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,719
regulations we see a lot of

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
computer controlled things which is very

86
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,439
good because we want to have everything

87
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,000
repeatable and consistent to get those

88
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,000
exact

89
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,800
particular terpenes or cannabinoids

90
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,120
we're looking for this extraction method

91
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,640
now that decarboxylation step the crude

92
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,878
oil from the rotary evaporator

93
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,719
is moved to an alternate container and

94
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,560
is ready for decarboxylation

95
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,080
where it's heated to about 104 degrees

96
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,439
celsius for 90 minutes

97
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
while spinning at 250 revolutions per

98
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,439
minute

99
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,280
so there's kind of that crude kind of

100
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,519
general uh extract that's

101
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,878
going through we have that rotation that

102
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,719
is occurring and spinning

103
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,359
and we can see temperature as well as

104
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,000
time very important protocols as part of

105
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,040
this

106
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,680
process of extraction now example

107
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,798
of a white film distillation machine so

108
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
here we see one

109
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
uh pictured right in the image here we

110
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,680
see these different flasks we also see

111
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,878
very different colorations because

112
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
remember we're extracting

113
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:36,318
distilling off different components on

114
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,759
the top right the decarboxylation oil

115
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,479
from the rotary evaporator

116
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,518
is ready to go through the machine and

117
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,919
then we have the

118
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,640
bottom left flask where the disc or

119
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,119
terpenes

120
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,878
is located the bottom right flask here

121
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,280
is the crude oil

122
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,280
and then we have extracting terpenes at

123
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
lower temperatures about 158 degrees

124
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,878
celsius and high pressure

125
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
the extracting distillate is a higher

126
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,518
temperature about 170 degrees

127
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,679
celsius and the lowest possible pressure

128
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,158
these pass the oil through the the

129
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,040
extract the terpenes then take the crude

130
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,639
oil from

131
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,039
from that pass and put it back in the

132
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,639
machine for a distillation extract

133
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,318
so sometimes things do have to pass

134
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,079
through multiple times

135
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,839
just to ensure you're pulling off those

136
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,120
specific fractions

137
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,599
of that original product now what is

138
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,439
that

139
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,680
resulting end product well the end

140
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,800
product of cannabis distillation is

141
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,400
the distillate as we can see right here

142
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,560
it's a pure oil-like substance with

143
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,560
nearly 100 cannabinoids

144
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,079
this distillate is used as the base

145
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,600
ingredient for most edibles

146
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,560
and most vapes it can be either thc or

147
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,879
cbd based

148
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,240
or a multitude of other cannabinoids

149
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,399
because of this high percentage

150
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,439
and this degree of specificity is why

151
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,560
this method

152
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:53,199
of extraction for cannabis is so popular

153
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,240
despite all of the required kind of

154
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,079
chemist background

155
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
and distal process and equipment and

156
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,240
monitoring and protocols

157
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,879
there is a kind of advantage in the end

158
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,199
product

159
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,639
after going through all those steps now

160
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,879
what are some advantages of this

161
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,720
distillation method just in general

162
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,240
that as i said extremely pure product

163
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
when compared to other extraction

164
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
methods you can have those

165
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,719
distinct separations occurring also

166
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
gives the

167
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,039
operator complete control over terpenes

168
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,639
and flavonoids and it can be easily

169
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,240
automated even though the initially it

170
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,560
may take a little time to kind of

171
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,800
learn all the protocols it can raise up

172
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,478
the option to be easily automated

173
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,079
however with any system it's always not

174
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,279
just advantages what are some of the

175
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,758
disadvantages

176
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,399
of this system is that it can be very

177
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,919
costly

178
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,159
can be a long process with multiple

179
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,159
steps it can take days to pass one liter

180
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,479
of crude oil through the machine

181
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,320
and the distillation process strips the

182
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,439
cannabis of all compounds except for the

183
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,120
desired compound

184
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,800
which may have dramatic effects on the

185
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,680
terpenes when adding them back into the

186
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,038
mixture

187
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,478
so that's just an important thing to

188
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:53,199
keep in mind it's great that it's very

189
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,639
specific

190
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,879
but because it's specific you're kind of

191
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,840
separating out those components

192
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,279
that maybe have a synergistic effect so

193
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,719
this hopefully explains a little bit

194
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,679
about the distillation method of

195
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,199
extraction

196
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,199
for cannabis plants
