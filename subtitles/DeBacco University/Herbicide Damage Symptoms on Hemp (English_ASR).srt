1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,280
now a threat with any using of any

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,519
herbicides is

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,519
the potential for drift well here we're

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,959
going to see some images of what some

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:17,920
common herbicide

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:17,920
drift damage looks like on hemp plants

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,439
welcome to this tobacco university video

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,640
where we're going to look at

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,399
herbicide damage symptoms on hemp so

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,760
first off there is this great reference

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,000
article and you're welcome to take a

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,079
look

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,359
at it from the university of california

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,320
and they look at herbicide damage

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,719
symptoms on hemp

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
pride the link here and they go through

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,039
more herbicides that i'm going to cover

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,640
here

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,920
try to pick out some of the very common

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,600
ones that might be utilized that you

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,000
might see or be familiar with

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,079
but this article has even more resources

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
if you want to take a look at that

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,198
so first off looking at herbicides in

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,799
general well here's the active

26
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,238
ingredients in trade names

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,759
a lot of people kind of focus on the

28
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:56,839
trade names but looking at that active

29
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,039
ingredient is important

30
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,199
understanding also common registered

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,800
uses at least in california at the time

32
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,959
that this data was pulled just to give

33
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,759
you an idea probably the most famous one

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,679
is roundup

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,439
is and the active ingredient is

36
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,118
glyphosate we'll also be looking at a

37
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,158
couple more kind of listed more by their

38
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,000
active ingredient

39
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,600
so compared to this list here because

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,200
you might be familiar with the trade

41
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,798
name

42
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,040
now glyphosate as i mentioned that first

43
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,360
one they are typically you know roundup

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,880
it's a post-emergent herbicide meaning

45
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,079
the weeds need to emerge before you

46
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,399
spray them

47
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,599
and it affects the meristematic regions

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,159
likely damaged by

49
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,559
drift on the hemp plants you want to

50
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,960
look for chlorosis which is a yellowing

51
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,359
that can progress to browning over five

52
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,879
to ten days it's a slow progression

53
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,920
we can see that evident here where it's

54
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,519
a little lighter in that yellow

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,399
coloration here it's a little bit more

56
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,519
evident here

57
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,960
this would be clear signs of glyphosate

58
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,078
drift that may have occurred

59
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,879
on your hemp plants then we also have a

60
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,279
paraquat

61
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,239
here and this is another post-emergent

62
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,799
let's see kind of

63
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,718
an example here it's a group d acts

64
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,040
rapidly within hours and drift can

65
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,559
appear as droplets browning necrosis

66
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,880
so we kind of get that little like

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
speckling effect now of course it occurs

68
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,679
in a larger degree you will get browning

69
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,598
of the entire leaf

70
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,598
but sometimes evan is that little like

71
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,280
speckling that might occur

72
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,719
and that can be an indication that

73
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,039
you're getting some spray drift from

74
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:22,318
this particular herbicide

75
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,878
then we have glucosinate which is injury

76
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,359
often

77
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,318
a function of concentration as well as

78
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,959
coverage

79
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,639
common trait name would be x out if

80
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,479
you're familiar with that type

81
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,318
typical symptoms initially occur within

82
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,000
a few days beginning with wilting

83
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,919
and chlorosis and progressing to

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,318
necrotic tissue here we see a little

85
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,679
more

86
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,318
aggressive of that kind of spotting

87
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,560
there a little more aggressive spread

88
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,639
and again this occurs typically a few

89
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,439
days again the evidence that this

90
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,479
herbicide

91
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,479
might have been drifted then a propanel

92
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,639
we see that one right here

93
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,039
injury is usually first observed in the

94
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,639
older fully formed leaves so that's

95
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,120
again an important distinction to make

96
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,639
here

97
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,640
looking at the older leaf damage not

98
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,799
necessarily the meristem

99
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,919
injuries often initially noted at the

100
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,519
leaf margins

101
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,359
such as the edges of the leaves and then

102
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,840
moves further into the interventile

103
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
areas

104
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
of the leaf it kind of starts at the

105
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
margins and works its way

106
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,800
in if the plant survives of the spoiler

107
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,878
exposure

108
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
newly formed leaves may not be effective

109
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,919
so this is one

110
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,519
that the plant can potentially grow out

111
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,359
of it

112
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,759
where is this herbicide typically used

113
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,440
well typically used for barnyard grasses

114
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,439
so if you have those in your particular

115
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,239
area might be spraying this at higher

116
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,400
frequency

117
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,319
this would be evidence of what drift to

118
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,560
be on the lookout for

119
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,878
and then lastly mentioned here synthetic

120
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,439
auxins and there's different types

121
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,199
at the whole plant level this abnormal

122
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,239
growth can take the form of leaf and

123
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,798
stem twisting

124
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,680
cupping bending cracking sometimes

125
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,000
curling

126
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
may occur and we see kind of the

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
evidence here of the plant just kind of

128
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
like

129
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
gets a little funky uh look to it again

130
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,080
just because you see leaf curling

131
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,959
doesn't always mean it's a herbicide

132
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,239
that was applied

133
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,878
but if you know one of these has been

134
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,719
applied in the area particularly 240

135
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,399
very known for its drifting abilities

136
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,479
and you see this curling that's an

137
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
indication that you may be getting some

138
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,639
of that herbicide

139
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,238
drift so just things to be cautious

140
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,000
for so i just wanted to provide you with

141
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,319
this kind of comparison here

142
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,478
if you are choosing the herbicide route

143
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,120
to be mindful of what product you'll be

144
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:24,959
using

145
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,560
and to be mindful of what those symptoms

146
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,918
may look on hemp plants

147
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,360
to be aware if you if drift is occurring

148
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,359
after your application
