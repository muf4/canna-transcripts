1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
okay so here what a look at diagnosing a

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,819
plant problem and how to go about that

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,290
not jump into conclusion since there's

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,419
nothing and a leaf for a plant and

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,070
saying oh that's clearly this properly

6
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,080
diagnosing going through some stepwise

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,179
process to classify the problem and

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,910
diagnose it properly so that control

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,469
measures can be implemented so first off

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,510
you have to know they plant know what

11
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,038
the plant looks like because in order to

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,679
diagnose a potential issue you need to

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,359
know what the normal is with the plant

14
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,890
look what's shouldn't the plant look

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,949
like and this could vary depend on the

16
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,170
cultivar take notes is good continuing

17
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,000
to document pictures because you want to

18
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,789
know what the normal of the plant should

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,960
look like edition and documentation is

20
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,969
important and this can help you track

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,950
trends and changes over time how the

22
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,570
plant look last week your memory may not

23
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,109
be as good as you think taking those

24
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,369
pictures will light or refer to that and

25
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:52,320
those pictures are great but also

26
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,329
including captions is also important

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,219
because those going to clean include the

28
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,070
conditions they're all important

29
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,379
information to include not only the

30
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,390
conditions the temperature what you

31
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,539
might be noticing at the time how old

32
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,680
the plant is all good things to document

33
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,689
then you want to classify the problem

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,150
this involves three main groups each

35
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:13,559
having subcategories the keys again not

36
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,659
to jump to conclusions and try to be

37
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,129
impartial proper classification will

38
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,228
help you develop a plan of action and

39
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,359
those classifications are is it a

40
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:24,118
nutrient issue it could be a toxicity or

41
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:28,170
a deficiency a disease or grower

42
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:30,868
implemented kind of problem so first off

43
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,450
for nutrients they tend to be across the

44
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:35,390
field or in the same kind of run that we

45
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,469
may see in that in a grow operation

46
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,269
important to notice the placement of the

47
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:42,060
issue in relation to the plants a new

48
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:43,560
girl or is it older gross this is an

49
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,740
example here in nutrient deficient this

50
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,509
is nitrogen in a cue Kermit field here

51
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,250
we could see low nitrogen and as we

52
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,469
progressed this way we get into more

53
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,790
nitrogen this is a field application

54
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:55,469
what's happening is that through heavy

55
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,990
rains the nitrogen was leaching out of

56
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:00,149
here and running down the hill a little

57
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:02,009
bit and kind of allowing these to have

58
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,170
the proper amount of nitrogen and needs

59
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,170
to become deficient you can kind of see

60
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,110
that trend occurring in the field and

61
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,670
trends are common with nutrient issues

62
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,840
now disease kind of a quick onset you

63
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,469
want to be sure you're checking both the

64
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,870
tops of the

65
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,539
and also the underside of leaves or many

66
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,490
diseases we'll start and lastly we have

67
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,069
a grower issue and this is usually

68
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,230
occurs in isolated cases could be poor

69
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,759
hand watering or consistency with

70
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:30,090
watering breaking the plant through

71
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:32,340
mishandling that's a spring improperly

72
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,379
causing spray damage here or applicator

73
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,200
blight would be one example here we see

74
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,030
an herbicide spray so these are ways

75
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,189
that we want to go about an approaching

76
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,759
when we're diagnosing an issue with our

77
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,759
plants
