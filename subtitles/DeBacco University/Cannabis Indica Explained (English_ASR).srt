00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,399
welcome to another debaco university

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,919
video lecture production

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,400
here we're going to be investigating

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:09,599
cannabis indica and explaining some of

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,599
its unique properties

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,359
and kind of what defines it looking just

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,280
at the image here we can see that the

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,559
leaf structure the morphology is really

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,559
how we classify

10
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,759
an indica versus sativa versus some of

11
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,839
the others so

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
here this indica is a much shorter and

13
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,839
wider leaf compared to other

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,679
sativas which germinate longer and

15
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,399
thinner leaf style

16
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,238
now in addition indicas are generally

17
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,399
agreed that originated on the

18
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,078
asian subcontinent possibly in the

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,399
afghanistan region

20
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,000
so kind of look in this general region

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,520
of the world right here

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,600
whether cannabis indica and kansas

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,359
sativa are truly separate species is

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,399
actually a matter of debate and some

25
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,920
controversy

26
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,160
since its classification is based on

27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,320
morphology the general plant behavior is

28
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,000
what is being compared here

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,840
so we're looking at the indicas having

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,119
certain morphologies or certain physical

31
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,559
characteristics now the indica plant

32
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,919
morphology so what is what are those

33
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:03,358
physical characteristics what does this

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
play actually look like

35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,719
well the height is small growing usually

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,560
one to six feet in

37
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,798
height and the internet spacing's

38
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,640
typically three inches or less

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,479
the leaf morphology tends to be a very

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320
wide appearance as we can clearly see in

41
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,200
this image here and also in this plant

42
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,319
as well

43
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,759
the leaves tend to be a little bit more

44
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,279
of a darker shade of green again

45
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,400
comparing them a little bit more to the

46
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,719
more traditional

47
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,320
sativas for example they tend to have

48
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,000
more side branching than sativas

49
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,839
resulting in a wider bushier plant

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,078
morphology overall

51
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,600
as a result this will cause denser

52
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,199
plants overall in their general

53
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,679
structure

54
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
popular cultivation locations for our

55
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,479
indicas

56
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,000
here in general they're kind of that

57
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,000
kind of in-between that i call like

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
goldilocks plant morphology compared to

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
others

60
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,239
as a result it increases the flexibility

61
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,759
of locations that it can be used

62
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,039
effectively in

63
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,640
great for growers looking at the quick

64
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,479
turnovers between growing cycles but

65
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,478
they don't get quite as hot as tall and

66
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,239
quick take up the area that sativa would

67
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,359
however indicates are still photoperiod

68
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,438
dependent so outdoor plantings be aware

69
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,359
the timing is also important because

70
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,478
they get shorter you want to be mindful

71
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,759
of that you don't want to plant them too

72
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,199
late in this season because they might

73
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,199
get flipped into flower

74
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,560
a little bit sooner and even stunt them

75
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,039
further

76
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,878
just in general there are many indica

77
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,719
cultivars that exist

78
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,280
northern lights is among the most famous

79
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,959
strain of all time and it's also a pure

80
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,039
indica for just a general sense of

81
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,479
comparison we have the bubble kush is

82
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,759
another example all these are going to

83
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,719
have that shorter kind of plant

84
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,919
morphology

85
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,080
and if you look at one of the leaves

86
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,000
it's going to be more of that short and

87
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,400
wider kind of appearance there

88
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,400
just to give you some idea of what

89
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,239
defines morphologically

90
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,239
a cannabis indica plant
