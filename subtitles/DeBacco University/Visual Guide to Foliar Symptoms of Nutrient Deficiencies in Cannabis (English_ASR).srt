1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,399
you're noticing your plant doesn't look

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,640
quite right hopefully this debacco

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,318
University video can provide you a great

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,800
visual guide to fol your symptoms of

5
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,400
nutrient deficiencies in cannabis plants

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,920
to help you identify the issue that

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,919
might be going

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,399
[Music]

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,320
on all right let's get into the visual

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,079
guide here fol your symptoms and help

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,640
provide you a diagnosis as well a

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,239
potential way to correct the issue so

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,640
first off some of these images are based

14
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,079
off the research article here if you

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,480
want to get into the research article in

16
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,399
more detail I provide the citation here

17
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,679
so you can do so now just some general

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,000
reminders is that nutrient mobility in

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,159
the plant for mobile nutrients they move

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,320
to New Growth areas that means

21
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,519
deficiency symptoms will first be seen

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,238
in older leaves in comparison to

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,280
immobile nutrients that don't move to

24
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:54,959
New Growth these deficiencies will be

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,520
first seen in the newer growth regions

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,039
of the plant we're talking about

27
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,039
classifying nutrients our primary

28
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,760
nutrients are nitrogen phosphorus and

29
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,679
pottassium and they contribute to plant

30
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,079
nutrient content uh function of plant

31
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,359
enzymes and biochemical processes and

32
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,679
integrity of plant cells your secondary

33
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,319
nutrients are your calcium your

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,040
magnesium and your sulfur and these are

35
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:15,079
needed in smaller amounts uh than the

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
primary nutrients leading us finally to

37
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:18,719
micronutrients which are necessary for

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,240
plant survival but are needed in very

39
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,679
small micro quantities when we look

40
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,798
about fertilizers um chated or kated

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
fertilizers are preferred since it will

42
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,079
enhance nutrient uptake and improve

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,040
efficiency and utilization and the goals

44
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:35,559
plant available nutrients and some of

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,000
them also are better applied Folly so

46
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,759
keep in mind if you can find a cated

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,078
form of a nutrient that is definitely

48
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,719
the way to go now nutrient

49
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:44,279
classifications just providing at this

50
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,560
table here we look at our nutrients

51
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,439
whether it's a macro or a micro the

52
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,079
uptake form and chemical form and ions

53
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,239
its mobility in the plant in the soil a

54
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,199
lot of people forget we're going to

55
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,640
focus of course on the plant Mobility

56
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,560
but soil Mobility can also play a factor

57
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,519
into your um odds you see a deficiency

58
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,799
or ways about going correcting it so

59
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,000
first off looking at this study we got

60
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,240
to start with the control plant where

61
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,560
there's no nutrient deficiencies uh

62
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:13,199
looking a here is week five week six

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,640
week seven and then week eight while in

64
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,560
week eight fan leaves developed

65
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,759
increasing levels of f chlorosis we can

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,598
see that here and here um this is

67
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,919
considered the control plant so we're

68
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,719
really looking at the infloresence of

69
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,518
the flowers the fan leaves yes we want

70
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,359
to see them good but here to the end

71
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:28,680
you're in good shape and as a last

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,120
reminder we are looking at a plant so

73
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,760
there will be some variables we can here

74
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,480
with the sunflowers there's going to be

75
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,239
some variability plant to plant so I'm

76
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,560
going to try to show you the major or

77
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,280
the textbook images if you will that you

78
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,959
should use for comparison so let's start

79
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,318
with a nitrogen um deficiency so looking

80
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,519
here a we're going at week three lower

81
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,119
canopy folar issue of nitrogen

82
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,360
deficiency plant starting to Yellow that

83
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,439
might be a little hard to see but we're

84
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,120
having a lightening of that green and

85
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:00,318
this will typically start in the lower

86
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,640
leaves we look at uh week four uh um

87
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,439
looking at week four the progression of

88
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:06,238
nitrogen deficiency symptoms of the fan

89
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,120
leaves from mild uh which is on the

90
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,920
right to the most severe which is of

91
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,799
course here on the left looking at C

92
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,119
here the whole Leaf closis developing

93
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,760
and fan leaves of the lower 2/3 of the

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,759
plant canopy and then for week five

95
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,560
almost the entire cence of fan leaves

96
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,359
stem Brown and yellowing and beginning

97
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,680
of Sugar Leaf chosis and nitrogen

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,080
deficient plants so a really advanced

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,400
form of yellowing so keep in mind it

100
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,480
might be a little hard to see here but

101
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,360
that lightening that green and different

102
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,119
varieties will have different deepness

103
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,879
to their green coloration so you want to

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,319
be aware of that now about correcting a

105
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:40,479
nitrogen deficiency and I'll do this for

106
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:43,199
all the nutrients remember it is a

107
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,158
primary mobile nutrient use 100 to 120

108
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,238
parts per million of nitrogen

109
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,719
fertilizers as the target concentration

110
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,400
I have other videos that go about how to

111
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:53,158
calculate that your nitrates versus your

112
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,239
nitrates remember nitrates dissolve in

113
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,239
water and therefore move about the soil

114
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,759
with uh the movement of soil water the

115
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,519
nitrites are not stable intermediate and

116
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,878
this is not able to be used by the plant

117
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,920
we can see that right here ammonia can

118
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:08,438
be taken up by the plant and nitrites

119
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,559
can be moved but nitrites cannot we're

120
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:13,878
also looking at ammonium ammonia versus

121
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,479
ammonium Ammon ammonia um has the

122
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,120
highest nitrogen content of any

123
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,519
commercial fertilizer about 82% nitrogen

124
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,720
however it is delivered as a gas it

125
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,439
needs to be injected about 4 to 8 in 10

126
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,360
to 20 cm below the surface um here it

127
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,839
will react with soil water to form

128
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,319
ammonium which can be utilized by the

129
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,918
plants for other Growers calcium nitrate

130
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,159
is Rec is recommended there's bloodmeal

131
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,758
there's ALB guano and there's uras that

132
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,600
are also um options but with uras like

133
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,680
nitrates Ura needs to dissolve in and

134
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,240
move through water soil and can be lost

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,319
through leeching if not converted to

136
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,120
ammonia and then ammonium this

137
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,680
conversion of ammonia takes about 2 to 4

138
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,840
days when soil moisture and temperature

139
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,759
are favorable for plant growth lower

140
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,560
temperature slow the process which will

141
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,080
continue down even the freezing because

142
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,839
they need the microbes to be able to

143
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:02,599
work that so typically in outdoor

144
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,879
applications Ura is recommended in those

145
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,720
summer or warmer months um calcium

146
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,918
nitrate when it's cooler out calcium

147
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
nitrate can be used throughout the

148
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,159
entire um season same with bloodmeal and

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,399
wano as just a last reminder with

150
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,080
nitrogen it happens quick so favor on

151
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,318
the lower side because you can always

152
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,680
add more it's hard to take

153
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,080
away now looking at phosphorus uh

154
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,160
deficiency here brown spots on fan and

155
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:26,758
sugar leaves looking here a week three

156
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,039
progression of folar phosphorus

157
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,080
deficiency symptoms in the fan leaves

158
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,000
and then we can kind see that

159
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,800
progression here um for week four and

160
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,600
then we have week five ref by um c as

161
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,240
well as D which is right below me uh in

162
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,879
E we see the whole plant phosphorous

163
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,439
deficiency symptoms sugar leaves

164
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,240
associated with the apal INF

165
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,478
infloresence are shown in the insert now

166
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,120
I will say overall I don't see a lot of

167
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,000
this um so really scrutinize um these

168
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,240
images to see if this is actually a

169
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,199
phosphorous deficiency you have going on

170
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,319
because of course there's other

171
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,560
pathogens or other issues uh that could

172
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,560
be occurring so really scrutinize these

173
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,399
images and see if that's really a good

174
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,319
match for what you're seeing in your

175
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,120
plant now how do you deal with the

176
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,199
phosphorus deficiency how you correct

177
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,000
that it is a primary mobile nutrient in

178
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,280
the plant it's generally immobile in the

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,120
soil so that's we have to keep in mind

180
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,879
our soil versus our plant comparisons

181
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,439
phosphates versus phosphites so

182
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,439
phosphates are essential for plant

183
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,959
growth phosphites are not essential

184
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,839
nutrients use more as a fungus site to

185
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,799
induce the systemic acquired resistance

186
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,719
or SAR in plants and not a fertilizer

187
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,439
not a common SE in Plants though most

188
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,479
grows over fertilize with phosphorus to

189
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,000
be honest especially when it gets to the

190
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,079
flowering stage and have other videos

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,199
showing you don't need as much

192
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:41,198
phosphorus as many Growers typically are

193
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,800
adding reasons for not over fertilizing

194
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,720
are to keep other nutrients in balance

195
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,598
and to maximize your yields to save

196
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,360
money and limit potential groundwater

197
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:52,038
contamination now potassium deficiency

198
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,319
we're seeing the progression of that we

199
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:57,318
see that in the um sugar leaves at week

200
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,960
four and the fan leaves at week four and

201
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,120
then we see the middle part of the

202
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,478
canopy really showing the most severe

203
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,959
portions now typically it is located a

204
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:07,000
little bit more on the margins of the

205
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,478
leaves or the edges of the leaves loated

206
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,199
a bit more on the ends of the leaves a

207
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,639
little bit more on the end portions and

208
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,080
then the margins within those so good

209
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,360
indications or areas to look if you're

210
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,159
suspecting a potassium deficiency now

211
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,960
how do you correct a pottassium

212
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,120
deficiency is a primary mobile nutrient

213
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,159
potassium sulfate would be recommended

214
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,120
you could use potassium chloride or

215
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,759
murate potassium it does have more

216
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,439
pottassium 60% versus is only 50 but

217
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,879
there are more salt associated with it

218
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,399
so it is used more in outdoor

219
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,080
applications where might be more natural

220
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,959
rain to flush through that we're just

221
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,800
looking at large trucks trying to carry

222
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,918
a higher concentration of pottassium

223
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,560
fertilizer some Growers recommend wood

224
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:48,560
ash um you can use it but be careful

225
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,240
because it will um raise your pH so use

226
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,800
it sparingly because it will bring your

227
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,360
pH Up dramatically on there then it

228
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,120
brings us to a Calcium deficiency so

229
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,120
progression of Calcium deficiency

230
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,360
starting in the lower of fan leaves here

231
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,519
in week three and then we see a more

232
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,080
severe um progression uh progress I

233
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,318
should say here going from a normal kind

234
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,560
of more advanced uh symptoms looking at

235
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,439
letter C week five is General leaf leaf

236
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,319
margin necrosis on lower fan leaves and

237
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:19,879
then we've got upper fan and sugar

238
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,158
leaves starting to show symptoms as well

239
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,439
at week five and then right next to me

240
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:26,680
over here week six the majority of fan

241
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,158
leaves and sugar leaves showed that

242
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,399
characteristic Leaf margin necrosis and

243
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:34,718
up leaves are curled uh upwards so again

244
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,120
key distinctive factors here so don't

245
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,159
just jump to one look at them all and

246
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,799
really see what signs you're seeing in

247
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:42,360
your leaves and what do they actually

248
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,479
match up with and hopefully you're

249
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,879
catching it in the earlier phases rather

250
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,039
than the later ones now how do you

251
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,278
correct a Calcium deficiency it's a

252
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,958
secondary immobile nutrient if you add

253
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,679
lime there is calcium in that product

254
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,159
but not as much of that plant available

255
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:59,559
so keep that in mind a Cal Mag from

256
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,958
banare I recommend that one and biom and

257
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,639
Cal I've used them both I have uh tissue

258
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,518
tests that show Cal Mag plus from

259
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,838
Botanicare does raise levels so follow

260
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,720
manufacturer recommendations um and keep

261
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,079
that feed going and hopefully you'll see

262
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,800
a Slowdown and then prevention of that

263
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:19,000
deficiency symptoms from there

264
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,240
progressing magnesium deficiency is

265
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,120
represented by interval chosis or

266
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,799
yellowing uh here we see a week four is

267
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,039
when it's first starting to appear might

268
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,838
be a little hard to see but it's first

269
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,639
starting to appear here and that's

270
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,040
through inter vinal chlorotic regions

271
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:36,480
the chlorosis is moving towards the

272
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,639
necrotic areas in between the leaflet

273
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,120
mid rib and the margins we kind of see

274
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,000
that where the veins stay really dark

275
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,159
green and those in between areas where

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,120
you're first seeing it here we see more

277
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,639
advanced week five the most of the

278
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,440
smaller fan leaves started to show

279
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,278
symptoms and then weak sick the

280
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,360
magnesium deficiency was widespread

281
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,278
across the entire plant except for some

282
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,519
older and larger fan leaves so it can be

283
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:01,639
a little spotty keep that in mind

284
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,159
corrected magnesium uh deficiency well

285
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,000
it's a secondary mobile nutrient calag

286
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,159
has some magnesium in it but Epsom salts

287
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,078
has a higher concentration of magnesium

288
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,600
if you're really targeting that 1

289
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:15,199
tblspoon per gallon um for early onset

290
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,360
and folar applications would be

291
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,120
recommended for Epsom salts a substate

292
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,120
drench an a folar application would be

293
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,919
recommended to try to ensure that that

294
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,078
magnesium is going to meet both ways and

295
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,039
reduce the duration that your plant

296
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:29,000
remains magnesium deficient 2

297
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,278
tablespoons per gallon or 2 tablespoons

298
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,759
uh per 3.7 L for a quick uh progressing

299
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,480
issue and something you want to kind of

300
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,600
really suppress as quickly as possible

301
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,120
this substrate is a drench rate because

302
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,440
if you apply that to the leaves you risk

303
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,360
the chance of them damaging it is a high

304
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,720
concentration rate um it's only

305
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,120
recommended in most severe cases um

306
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,519
there but it has been used and there's a

307
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,399
chance of burn uh but don't go any

308
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,480
higher than that would be my

309
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,480
recommendation now manganese is

310
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,720
different than magnesium it's basically

311
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,879
lacking a flower size so I know as soon

312
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,040
as I say that most Growers are going

313
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,720
think oh I have a manganese deficiency

314
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,480
um not necessarily the case we can see

315
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,639
the manganese deficient versus the

316
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,360
control for that comparison at week

317
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,680
seven this is the um treatment or the

318
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,639
manganese deficient and that's the

319
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,479
control so you can see it is a slight

320
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,120
decrease in size and only really with a

321
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,759
good comparison can you really tell the

322
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,399
difference between those two images now

323
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,159
how do you go about correcting a meganes

324
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,720
uh deficiency you could use manganese

325
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:28,958
sulfate often branded as palm tree

326
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,959
fertilizer as we can see right here I

327
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,638
also personally recommend age-old grow

328
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,838
again not sponsored by them but while

329
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,399
the label States it only has um

330
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,240
0.05% remember these are guaranteed

331
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,159
minimums and based on tissue test uh the

332
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,519
likely actual concentration is quite

333
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:47,439
High because I fed um age-old grow and

334
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,360
I've seen manganese increase in tissue

335
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,480
test levels and it shouldn't at 05%

336
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,879
these are guaranteed minimums so more

337
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,720
likely than not this contains a little

338
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,519
bit more than that and can be used to

339
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,200
correct meanes and also a good General

340
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,320
fertilizer uh just for General

341
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,519
feeding leading us to a sulfur

342
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,399
deficiency this is um yelling of the

343
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,519
sugar leaves and this first appears as

344
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,639
yelling of the younger sugar leaves and

345
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,519
then progresses upwards and angled

346
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,560
upward in canopy fan leaves we can kind

347
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:15,320
of see that here where they're starting

348
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,799
to kind of go from this to a little bit

349
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,199
more of that upward angle the following

350
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,639
week symptoms did not progress in the

351
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,479
sugar leaves rather they progressed in

352
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,480
the fan leaves as we can see that kind

353
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,959
of here as inter vinal chlorosis not to

354
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,639
be confused with a magnesium deficiency

355
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,759
the most severe and lower fan leaves um

356
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,759
here so keep that in mind and look at

357
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,039
the distinctive yellowing it's a very

358
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:40,240
bright yellow um coloration so keep that

359
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:43,439
in mind but we first seen in those upper

360
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,680
um sugar leaves so timing is important

361
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,800
in Catching these early as any grower

362
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,198
should be scattering their plants on a

363
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,439
regular basis now how do you go about

364
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,198
correcting a sulfur uh deficiency

365
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,040
remember it's an a secondary immobile

366
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:59,198
nutrient adding Elemental sulfur or

367
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,198
sulfuric acid or battery acid will add

368
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,759
sulfur but also drive your pH down

369
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,879
dramatically so these are not

370
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,439
recommended potassium sulfate if you

371
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,240
need potassium it also contains um um

372
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,199
some sulfur with it you could also add

373
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,320
gypsum which will not alter your pH

374
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:15,799
there's also other sources um of sulfur

375
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,360
so you might want to look at those some

376
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,958
also give you the benefits of other

377
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,839
nutrients um such as calcium or nitrogen

378
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,039
so take those into consideration and

379
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,959
hopefully you're identifying this

380
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,679
potential issue

381
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,759
early iron deficiency so progression to

382
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,039
various disate symptoms here of iron

383
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,039
deficiency on the upper and lower canopy

384
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,759
tissue throughout the trial the mild

385
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:39,360
closis on recently developed sugar

386
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,000
leaves um we can see here week five we

387
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,360
start to see modeling and chlorosis in

388
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,639
the central areas of those sugar leaves

389
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,720
located right there and see this uh

390
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,600
disappeared in later weeks so catching

391
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,120
it early and then seeing it shift was

392
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,920
interesting week six though the edge

393
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,120
necrosis of the lower fan leaves was

394
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,078
evident and that is key for an iron

395
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,720
deficiency now how do you go about

396
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:02,799
correcting an iron deficiency well it's

397
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,680
a micro immobile nutrient so you don't

398
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,879
need much of it remember it's a micro

399
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,919
plant available forms are important as

400
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,278
adding iron nails or iron fire Lings

401
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:12,399
will increase iron but not necessar

402
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:14,278
plant available forms that's where those

403
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,639
keade forms can be important for this

404
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,759
nutrient so if you can see that on the

405
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:21,039
label um that's great uh biomin iron is

406
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,560
another um plant available form it uses

407
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,599
an amino acid to help make that plant

408
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,439
available and you can use Ferris iron

409
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,440
sulfate but in this case remember this

410
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,480
is um highly acidified it's a pH of too

411
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,240
so Growers need to make corrections to

412
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,920
ensure that that Ferris sulfate solution

413
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,879
is actually plant available and not

414
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,159
doing more harm than good now on my last

415
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,240
slide here I just want to provide you

416
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,759
with General deficiency symptoms so you

417
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,839
can kind of refer to this and see sulfur

418
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,919
and calcium and nitrogen and magnesium

419
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,800
and phosphorus to best match up

420
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,078
potentially what you're seeing now keep

421
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,278
in mind those calcium and those

422
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,039
phosphorus can look very close I tend to

423
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,879
see more calcium deficiencies than

424
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,919
phosphorus but utilize this here to

425
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,720
visually diagnose your plants as well to

426
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,039
hopefully provide you suggestions for

427
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,000
fertilization to reduce the symptoms and

428
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,000
to prevent it in the future
