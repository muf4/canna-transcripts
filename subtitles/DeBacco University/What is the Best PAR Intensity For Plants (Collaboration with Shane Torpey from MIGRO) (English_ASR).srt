1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,120
welcome to this debacco University video

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,759
with yet another collaboration with

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,679
Shane from migro here we're going to be

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,080
looking at what the best par intensity

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,960
for plants is as the image shows here

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,839
plant par intensity versus growth rate

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,600
will be compared in addition we'll get

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,359
into carbon dioxide enrichment and how

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,480
that impacts plants as well as DLI The

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,000
Daily Light integral and providing you

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,039
with an easy equation to do some

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,960
calculations to determine what you are

13
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,960
giving your plants

14
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,599
[Music]

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,959
well welcome Shane again we've uh got

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,039
Shane from micr grow here today we're

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,920
going to be discussing Optimum par

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:50,359
intensity in DLI now par intensity and

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,359
Par we have another video released I'm

20
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,878
going into a little bit more in depth on

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:59,280
what that is basically is looking at the

22
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:00,439
intensity um of light of range of

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,439
spectrums

24
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:03,079
here we're going to be looking at how it

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,000
relates to plants in a little bit more

26
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,439
of a specific way starting with plants

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,759
photosynthesize uh so with this par

28
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:12,559
intensity is this basically the same

29
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,879
needed no matter what plant I'm growing

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,439
Shane or is there differences with that

31
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:21,560
there are definitely differences um

32
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:23,599
plants have developed in nature um to

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,240
succeed in different environmental

34
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,199
conditions so for example there are

35
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,359
plants which are optimized to grow with

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,759
relatively L fire intensity plants that

37
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,159
would grow for example on a forest floor

38
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,079
where there would be a lot of

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,520
shade and for cannabis

40
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:45,559
cannabis is able to use high power

41
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:49,118
intensity so it has been shown that

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,240
there is continuous increase in

43
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:55,280
photosynthesis all the way up to about,

44
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:58,879
1500 micromoles of par intensity um

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,799
which is a a high level um after which

46
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,199
you get a reducing rate of

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,399
return now that intensity is important

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,920
because you know we're trying to

49
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,199
maximize all of our plants and

50
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,118
production if we're growing a plant that

51
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,679
needs a little less we can cut back on

52
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:13,719
that gr a plant needs a little bit more

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,640
well now we can justify that more

54
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,318
intense light now with lighting we're

55
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:20,000
typically growing in indoor environments

56
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,598
um and that gives some Growers the

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,800
option of adding CO2 and you hear a lot

58
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:26,560
about this you know it's part of the

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,920
photosynthetic equation um how may that

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,680
change things when related to par light

61
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:34,079
intensity and plant

62
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,200
production yeah so plants are absorbing

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,519
the photons from light and they're using

64
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,799
that energy to photosynthesize and

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,800
photosynthesis uses CO2 um as part of

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,319
that chemical reaction having enriched

67
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,040
CO2 so higher than would be available in

68
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:53,079
in the normal atmosphere which is about

69
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:56,639
400 parts per million to increase that

70
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,360
CO2 level so you have a closed system

71
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,479
and you're supplementing that CO2 with

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,360
either you know CO2 gas or a burner or

73
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,439
whatever system you're using you can

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,280
enrich that level of CO2 and it has been

75
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:11,598
demonstrated that enriching that up to

76
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,080
about 12 or 1300 parts per million can

77
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,840
increase the relative growth rate by up

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,599
to

79
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,158
30% that's the for the same in light

80
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,079
intensity and uh environmental

81
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:26,598
conditions and um plant genetics you can

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,360
have a relative increase of growth with

83
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:33,199
um with higher with concentrated CO2 of

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,319
up to 30% which is quite extor read yeah

85
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,079
that CO2 can uh definitely with the

86
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:38,798
light intensity definitely help increase

87
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,879
plant production keep in mind as Growers

88
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,280
you have to keep your water and

89
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:43,679
nutrients and everything else

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,360
supplemented as well but lighting and

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,239
CO2 is a big part of that photosynthetic

92
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,840
equation now when we're talking about

93
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,719
this intensity of light we're not just

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,158
giving them like a burst or a flash of

95
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,919
light something that's brought up is

96
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,479
called DL which is looking more about

97
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,280
the intensity of light or the summation

98
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,679
of light that it experien expences the

99
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,598
plant has over the over a day or the

100
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,680
lighting period can you go a little bit

101
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:08,679
more about this DLI maybe how it's

102
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,599
calculated and how Growers can better

103
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,920
understand how they can apply this to

104
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,759
the plants they growing yes when we

105
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:19,839
measure par we're measuring par at a

106
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,000
moment in time so that par intensity is

107
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,799
measuring the

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,360
photons um the intensity of the quantity

109
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,120
of photons over a meter squared per

110
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:35,479
second d I is actually measuring the

111
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,879
amount of power that will accumulate

112
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:40,279
over the light cycle so say for example

113
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,639
you're running at a 12-hour light cycle

114
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,839
you're multiplying the 12-h hour light

115
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,199
cycle by the number of minutes in that

116
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:51,638
hour by the number of seconds um in

117
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,840
those minutes by the instantaneous power

118
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,240
intensity and to give an example if

119
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,799
you're running at about 800 micro moles

120
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,600
of power over a 12h hour day that

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,000
generally would equate to around 40 DLI

122
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,639
um which is considered on the upper end

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,759
of what a plant can absorb over over one

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,199
light cycle um I would be used you know

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,360
for example in in in tomato growing if

126
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,800
you're supplementing um but also can be

127
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,960
um related to cannabis growth as

128
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,680
well and that's important to keep in

129
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,239
note if uh you know if you're growing a

130
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,600
photo period dependent plant you're

131
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,840
switching it from an 18-hour light Day

132
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,039
to a 12-h hour light day that will imp

133
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,679
your DLI as Growers so that's where

134
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,318
people will use more intense lights and

135
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,959
flowering to try to make up for that

136
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,319
loss of time be aware it can only go so

137
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:44,359
high the plants can only utilize so much

138
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:47,479
and I would add to that as well Matthew

139
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,919
that um with um with regard to we've got

140
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,800
typically cannabis Growers would be

141
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:53,799
growing either photo period plants which

142
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,478
would be flowering on a 12h hour cycle

143
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,759
but they may also be growing Autoflower

144
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:01,959
plants which Growers would often have a

145
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:06,038
20h hour life cycle generally I could I

146
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:09,359
would recommend a a lower average par

147
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:10,918
intensity for um Autoflower plants

148
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,400
because they're they're growing over a

149
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,639
longer day cycle and therefore they're

150
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:18,839
going to be absorbing more over that um

151
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,120
that longer cycle hence the lower light

152
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,239
intensity

153
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,879
recommendation excellent great point and

154
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,960
I know some people have explained it to

155
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,598
me and try to do the same think about

156
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,598
like a rain gauge you know you're how

157
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:31,719
much water are you accumulating over a

158
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,879
day versus how much is falling right now

159
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,479
and what's falling right now would be

160
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,800
the par DLI would be that accumulation

161
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,918
over a day when the lights go out empty

162
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,360
the empty the can out and then you can

163
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,519
go through and remeasure the next day so

164
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,199
just giving them more in a burst like

165
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,198
rainwater doesn't do much good for the

166
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,000
plants just like en lighten you have
