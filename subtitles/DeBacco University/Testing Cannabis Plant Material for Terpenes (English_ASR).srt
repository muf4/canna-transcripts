1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,759
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,000
going to be looking at testing chemist

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:09,279
plant material for the all-important

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,199
terpenes a lot of growers are looking at

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,000
producing unique terpene profiles

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,718
because a lot of

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,399
consumers are looking for very specific

8
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,919
or unique terpene profiles

9
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,759
so we're going to go and study a little

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:30,000
bit more about the testing in this

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:31,439
debaco university video

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
all right let's get into testing canvas

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,359
plant material for terpenes

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
well first off uh looking at the

15
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,640
terpenes in general they're not unique

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,520
to cannabis and are often responsible

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,840
for the odor

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
of the plant you can see a sweet

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,320
smelling a sour smelling and earthy or

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,320
spicy

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,878
you can see some of the terpenes listed

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,558
here on this kind of displayed wheel

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,159
different cannabis varieties produce

24
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,399
unique terpene profiles which

25
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,519
in combination with the unique ratios of

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,439
cannabinoids

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,719
may determine some of the preferred

28
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,839
medical benefits

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,159
by certain uh end users so here we can

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,920
see kind of just kind of summary here

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,439
and kind of look through and pause the

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
video and look at that in a little bit

33
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:09,519
more detail

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,000
but just to show some of the

35
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,239
classifications of these terpenes

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
kind of where they fall on this kind of

37
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,359
general

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,640
kind of classification and what kind of

39
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,400
effects they may

40
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
result in where their flashpoint and

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,280
boil points are

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,680
just to give you some more information

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
and hopefully an organized format

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
now the importance of terpenes just in

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,840
general is that since terpenes

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,280
are not cannabinoids some feel they are

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,240
not important constituents

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,719
of the cannabis plant or product however

49
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,798
there is

50
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,798
increasing evidence that other chemicals

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,920
in the plant work synergistically with

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,159
the cannabinoids

53
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,240
that produce the therapeutic response so

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,320
even though the cannabinoids thc

55
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,719
cbd get a lot of the attention these

56
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,719
terpenes and some of them the profiles

57
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,478
may have this synergistic effect so

58
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,519
there might be of greater importance

59
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,519
despite their varied and sometimes lower

60
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,039
concentrations there is some evidence

61
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,200
that shows these effects can include

62
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,640
lowering inflammation and regulation of

63
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
blood glucose

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
to protecting to protection of neurons

65
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
as well as gastric

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,598
cells so we're still studying and

67
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
learning more about these

68
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,159
but it seems like early indications that

69
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
their importance is only going to be of

70
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,439
increase so it's important to get a good

71
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,039
analysis and a test

72
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,878
of that included within the plant

73
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,318
material so how do we

74
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,919
analyze those terpenes so chemical

75
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,199
analysis has generally been done by

76
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,799
capillary

77
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,439
gc ms sources gas chromatography mass

78
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,599
spec

79
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,759
for this complex mixture of over 200

80
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,199
different terpene compounds

81
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,039
however there's recent reports that

82
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,000
employing a liquid chromatography mass

83
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,759
spec technique

84
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,400
with atmospheric pressure chemical

85
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,239
ionization apci

86
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,719
may not have been the optimum

87
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,840
chromatography separation efficiencies

88
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,680
compared to capillary gc columns but

89
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
when combined with the mixture analysis

90
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
capabilities of tandem

91
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
mass spec this may produce the results

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
needed

93
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,518
while also being admirable to some of

94
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,480
the other

95
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,200
important cannabis compounds in the same

96
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,119
sample

97
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,119
there's some evolution in the an

98
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,920
improvement hopefully in the analysis of

99
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,920
terpenes

100
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,359
because of their determined importance

101
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,199
being able to make sure that the

102
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,920
analytical report is presenting those

103
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,639
terpenes

104
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,318
in the most accurate way possible so

105
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,238
what's the suggestion for ankle

106
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,439
uh analytical techniques when it comes

107
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,280
to terpenes

108
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,120
well this quantitative determination of

109
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,759
terpenes and

110
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,239
substituent terpenes is often desired

111
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,959
and perhaps best done by either gcms

112
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,719
or lcm sms instead of some of the

113
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,239
earlier reported techniques

114
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,000
and why is this important to understand

115
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,759
well if you're a grower you want to make

116
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
sure that your plant material is getting

117
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,719
tested properly

118
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,560
if you're a consumer looking at the end

119
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,280
report you want to know what techniques

120
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,039
were used

121
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,560
to make sure it's the most efficient and

122
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,679
most accurate techniques

123
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,920
to ensure you can trust results provided

124
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,959
so we'll look at lastly these terpene

125
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,639
profiles

126
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,878
often consumers will seek out specific

127
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,839
terpenes or profiles that may have

128
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,158
improved relief

129
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,759
for their particular condition growers

130
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,359
also like to showcase their dripping

131
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,079
profiles and provide a selling point for

132
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
the product

133
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,519
so you can see both consumers as well as

134
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,360
growers have a vested

135
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,879
interest in analyzing studying

136
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,639
and making public the terpene profile

137
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,120
it all comes together with a quality

138
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,960
test with accurate results

139
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,879
so that consumers can make an informed

140
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,719
decision and growers can know what their

141
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,719
plant is actually producing
