1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,318
okay if you're gonna take a brief look

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,459
at some fertilizer labels keep in mind

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,108
that while sometimes they are labeled

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,990
fertilizer just here no lights there's

5
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:12,000
no other information you can see the NPK

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,160
nitrogen phosphorus potassium listed

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,009
here this is zero zero fifteen getting

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,719
50 percent is potassium flip some bags

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,429
over this is humic acid along give you

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,890
some other information such as chemical

11
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,618
composition analysis and suggested

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,899
applications now specifically at

13
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,219
fertilizer labels they don't really lie

14
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,809
to you but they often don't tell the

15
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:32,579
entire story so it's important to know

16
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,570
what they're actually telling you it's

17
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,890
important to keep in mind that

18
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,259
fertilizers are regular at the state

19
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,539
level and various state lemon laws are

20
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:40,799
similar but sometimes not identical

21
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,058
so again just if you're looking at

22
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,878
comparing different fertilizers

23
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:46,859
comparing across state lines that can

24
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,009
sometimes present an issue but not often

25
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,019
the case those stated values though

26
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,539
fertilizer labels state the guaranteed

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,609
minimum which means there could be more

28
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,379
in there than what stated on the label I

29
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,229
think it's important note to remember

30
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,539
it's a guaranteed minimum it's the

31
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,269
minimum amount that's in there so if

32
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,739
they say 5 percent nitrogen it's

33
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,438
guaranteed them saying basically there's

34
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:13,289
at least 5% now companies do not want to

35
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,059
under quote by a large margin as far as

36
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,430
what they're selling so if it says 5

37
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,079
percent nitrogen you know they're not

38
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,640
going to have potentially fifteen

39
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,709
percent nitrogen this iguana usually

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,000
state that but it's a guaranteed minimum

41
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,969
and I think that's important you know to

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,938
make to make as far as when you're

43
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,650
looking at comparing fertilizers those

44
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:33,868
nutrient forms also that are listed

45
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,719
nutrients are listed as a molecule or

46
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:41,400
not a single element so we see here with

47
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:43,950
ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 and

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,200
seven water molecules there's 20% iron

49
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,930
in here information Fe but again it's

50
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,390
ferrous that's iron sulfate is the main

51
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,770
molecule that's presented here now this

52
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,540
is because roots absorb most of the

53
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:57,390
nutrients as inorganic ions or molecules

54
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,100
and not single elements these roots

55
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,549
always say oh they're up taking nitrogen

56
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,769
for example it's not just pure nitrogen

57
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,180
in this case with our iron example

58
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:06,839
they're not up taking just pure iron

59
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,909
pure Fe

60
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,400
they're taking in maybe in this case

61
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,919
have ferrous sulfate so that's why

62
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,170
they're stated in molecules and

63
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,169
only pure elemental form
