1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
hey hero and talk about viruses and how

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,019
they relate to plants and while this is

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:08,969
a very broad category I'm gonna try to

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,489
single out couple things to focus in on

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,769
one here being kind of a mottled look to

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,460
the leaves it's an example of what one

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,960
virus tobacco mosaic looks like so what

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,519
is why it's not easy to identify is

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,039
there's many different viruses that can

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,660
cause different visual symptoms to

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,250
mention here the modeling is one but

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,189
this isn't true for necessary all

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,410
viruses also the virus itself can only

14
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,808
be seen with an electron microscope or

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,000
other very extremely fine viewing mic

16
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:37,409
microscopes your traditional light

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,308
microscope that you may have used to

18
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:43,500
look at cells in say a biology class

19
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:45,718
will not be able to see viruses they are

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,320
extremely extremely small this

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,558
indication here is zero point two

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,939
micrometers extremely small viewing so

23
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,948
you have to use very specialized

24
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,820
equipment to go to puzzle identify the

25
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:01,108
virus itself now we're to look typically

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,759
you'll see a model look to the leaves

27
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,189
even though there are some variability

28
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,810
but model look is one relative

29
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,899
consistency across many different

30
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,460
viruses also viruses often do not kill

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,280
the plant entirely but they can reduce

32
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,599
the yields and cause visual

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,280
characteristics that develop these

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,019
leaves should be nice even coloration

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,030
and we can see that model look

36
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,859
definitely evident here and here in

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,509
canvas we see kind of one portion being

38
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,000
kind of that weird kind of coloration

39
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,890
look to it how to prevent it well

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,560
prevention of the vectors insects and

41
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,950
tools is important agents are very

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,150
common virus vector or carrier in gaad's

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,969
spreading through an entire grow

44
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,799
facility very quickly also smoking

45
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,688
tobacco in a growth area is not advised

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,030
as the smoke can transmit tobacco mosaic

47
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:47,339
virus so a lot of times we'll see no

48
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,868
milk no smoking signs in tobacco fields

49
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,329
which may seem kind of counterintuitive

50
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:53,609
but it's because of the fear of tobacco

51
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,419
mosaic which can translate transmitted

52
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:59,129
through the smoke of the cigarette here

53
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,599
for control since virus there's only DNA

54
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,699
wrapped in a protein coat there's really

55
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,709
nothing to kill you can really kill a

56
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,170
virus codes that this is very living to

57
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,639
begin with so control does not have to

58
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,409
do with the virus particles but those

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,929
things that may transmit the particles

60
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,680
the things that make area so a way to

61
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,688
prevent

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,930
virus infection to go back would be to

63
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:21,120
prevent acids or control your Asians

64
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,629
which is an insect not as a virus itself

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,658
but that's vectoring that virus particle

66
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:29,818
and also yourself or tools that may come

67
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:33,750
from an infected area try to clean those

68
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:35,568
sterilizers in a way to kind of limit

69
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,158
that potential unwanted

70
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:41,188
cross-contamination from a virus

71
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:43,019
infected plant to another plant you

72
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:44,669
yourself should be mindful simply

73
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,889
dipping your hands in milk is one way

74
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,500
growers for tobacco fields have been

75
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:51,389
able to reduce the spread of virus so

76
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,400
all things to consider because once you

77
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:55,319
get it well may not kill the plant it

78
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,329
definitely will have a negative impact

79
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,328
on the plant plants performance
