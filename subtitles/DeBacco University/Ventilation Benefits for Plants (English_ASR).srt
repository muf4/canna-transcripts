1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,388
okay here investigate ventilation

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,129
benefits for plants and it's very

3
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:07,378
important to keep air circulation and

4
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:09,870
air movement for your plants and here

5
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:11,218
we're gonna investigate why that is so

6
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,689
starting with keeping air moving it's

7
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:14,939
important to have continual air movement

8
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,920
around the plants in nature very still

9
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,019
conditions are rare there's always a

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,609
breeze of some kind you have to be on a

11
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,379
sailboat to realize that to the

12
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,868
prevalence wind turbines if you look at

13
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,910
any flag it simply flapping and even the

14
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:29,250
slightest of breeze so we want to create

15
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,710
or maintain these natural conditions

16
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,829
because this is a much benefit to our

17
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,840
plants so mixing our air high air rises

18
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,340
and that mixing air can lead to thermal

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,320
stratification so what that means is

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,899
higher is going to rise and that we want

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,189
to stay to tend towards the top and cold

22
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,378
air will sink inside it's a tends

23
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,299
towards the bottom so now that is only

24
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,488
to be exchanged between the inside and

25
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,378
the outside but circulation is important

26
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:54,869
to limit this stratification that could

27
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,878
occur and also to reduce the chance of

28
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:59,280
disease so rather than at 50 degrees

29
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,589
Celsius appear in 40 down here about 45

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,058
kind of mix throughout now should be too

31
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,280
hot for our plants but this just gives

32
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:08,429
you that idea of having everything

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,469
modernized now the carbon dioxide

34
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,470
depletion because plants consume carbon

35
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:15,840
dioxide and if air is left stagnant it

36
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:18,509
can become depleted in this carbon

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,368
dioxide which can result in negatively

38
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,259
impacting the growth because carbon

39
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:24,118
dioxide remember the carbon is used for

40
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,879
the sugar production disease now that

41
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,618
help the plant grow but also to maintain

42
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,390
itself and allow the roots to do the

43
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,640
respiration so we want to make sure

44
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,159
we're not depleting our co2 which if air

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,719
stagnant that can occur by mixing that

46
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,909
air we're ensuring that there's adequate

47
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,640
co2 hopefully being mixed around the

48
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,040
plant said just it being depleted around

49
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,349
the leaf at surface air circulation

50
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,360
exchange is important typically you have

51
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,309
air exit out the top points of a

52
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,629
structure so this is kind of a grow tent

53
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,649
Harrises an exhaust fan here too the

54
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:57,750
exhausting air out the top of the

55
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,030
structure and indeed could be coming in

56
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,040
at the lower points the idea is to

57
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,340
remove the hot air and bring in cooler

58
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,649
air

59
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,880
despite air movement ideally the

60
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,310
difference in temperature should be

61
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,780
minimal to reduce plant stress you want

62
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,189
to be exhausting really hot air and

63
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,568
bringing in really cool air because that

64
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,919
can make it very difficult to maintain

65
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:15,719
consistent conditions

66
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,199
for your plan the goal is to have about

67
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:21,419
85 I'm sorry about 75 to 80 degrees

68
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,759
Fahrenheit for your plants during the

69
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:27,299
day and you can cool it down to 65 to 70

70
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,219
or so Fahrenheit at night and that fresh

71
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,050
air intake but again make sure the air

72
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:32,669
is evenly dispersed in the room and the

73
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,650
temperature does not cause shock to the

74
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:36,689
plants you want to be extremely hot or

75
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,819
extremely cold and you do want to be

76
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:40,949
kind of evenly dispersed so it's gonna

77
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:43,229
change where you place intake or exhaust

78
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:44,639
valves keeping in mind you don't want to

79
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,349
go through that high temperature shock

80
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,208
so be not on a stress potentially to

81
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,479
your heating and cooling system but also

82
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,129
the plants you're trying to grow your

83
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,929
ducting the goal is to avoid harsh

84
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,209
angles when you do have ducting so here

85
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,430
we have a carbon filter we don't have a

86
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,099
lot of right angles or 180 degree loops

87
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,959
or bends one to have efficient air flow

88
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,000
so it's not always possible to run a

89
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,920
complete straight line but you could see

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,289
here I've maintained kind of a straight

91
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,339
of a line as I possibly can if you have

92
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,048
too many bends in it that's going to

93
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,900
increase the air resistance and reduce

94
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,819
your efficiency so this carbon filters

95
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,260
towards the front of the tent here it's

96
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:21,839
exhausting out the middle so it was just

97
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:25,019
a gentle Bend here as it goes out of the

98
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,239
ducting target growing conditions we're

99
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:30,329
looking at 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit

100
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,509
during the day night times 65 to 70 and

101
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:35,340
that 50 to 60% humidity or so is what

102
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:38,340
you're generally targeting for your grow

103
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,539
room and moving air on plants this is

104
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,099
important because it helps keep the

105
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:42,750
plants strong we kind of having them

106
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,729
sway in the breeze a little bit that can

107
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,900
help keep them rigid and stronger

108
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:48,449
instead of getting really leggy

109
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,920
I can also help reduce disease from

110
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:51,750
preventing moisture from building up in

111
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,419
certain areas minimize thermal

112
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,489
stratification which is great because

113
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,318
you'll have an even temperature at the

114
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,000
top and bottom of your plants it can

115
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,619
allow us co2 to be mixed to help prevent

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,479
starving plants of the vital carbon now

117
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,650
mixing of this air can be large fans if

118
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,509
you're in a smaller operation this

119
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,519
little six inch tin we're in a small

120
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:14,870
grow tent this may be enough to keep

121
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,870
your plants nice and happy
