1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,240
going to go over some of the specifics

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,160
of looking at microbial analysis

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,919
of cannabis plant material which is an

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,120
important test to look at

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,120
here you're going to learn about the

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,240
details

8
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:21,439
[Music]

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,439
all right let's get into testing

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,719
cannabis plant material for microbial

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,879
analysis

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,479
so first off here is a research article

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,038
where some of the information was pulled

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,800
from

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,039
again a summary here but you can go

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,399
through and research this yourself if

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,679
you're looking at

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,000
learning a little bit more about the

19
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,359
details that were presented here

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,878
we're going to use this study to focus

21
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,320
on the microbes but in addition they

22
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,399
also talk about heavy metals

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,520
and pesticides other important tests

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,399
that are mentioned on

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
other videos on this channel so first

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,399
off cannabis

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,879
diseases so at least 88 fungal species

28
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,679
cause disease in cannabis as do eight

29
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,799
uh patho varieties of plant pathogenic

30
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,640
bacteria

31
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,479
so there's a lot of diseases that

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,079
cannabis plants can acquire

33
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,560
the most threatening disease of

34
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,840
flowering tops are caused by the

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,760
inquitous fungi botrytis scenario

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,920
typically referred as gray mold as we

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,159
can see here botrytis

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,079
and we also have alternaria that can

39
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,200
cause issues with the plants that tend

40
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,920
to produce kind of

41
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,320
brown uh looks like little brown circles

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
uh

43
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,239
starts using the lower leaves can work

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,560
its way up but these are just two

45
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,519
macroscopic examples but remember

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,879
there's also fungal species that can be

47
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,239
microscopically involved that can still

48
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,759
cause contamination

49
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:41,158
and that pro bed end product

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,280
so pathogenic threat to humans well

51
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,040
phytopathogens cannot infect humans

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,920
except perhaps immunocompromised

53
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
individuals

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,640
so there are some different types of

55
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,879
pathogens that may not be of direct

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,719
infection to humans however there

57
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,560
there's opportunistic infections by

58
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,840
alternaria as you can see here as a

59
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,200
microscopic view

60
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
they've been reported in patients

61
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
receiving chemotherapy recent organ

62
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,960
transplants

63
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
patients as well as people with aids

64
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,679
also airborne canadia which are

65
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,959
basically spores

66
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,719
of of scenario and alton area cause mold

67
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,159
allergies and asthma particularly in

68
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,439
greenhouse workers

69
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,120
so don't think that you're completely

70
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,159
immune just because that pathogen may

71
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,759
not be a direct

72
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,560
human infection agent it can cause other

73
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,759
potential

74
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,199
symptoms as well so indoor and outdoor

75
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,120
problem when we're looking at these

76
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,560
pathogens it's not just an indoor grower

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,039
it's not just an outdoor grower

78
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,239
asperger aspergillus and penicillium

79
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,359
predominant indoors

80
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,120
and cladosporium predominant outdoors

81
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,160
so if you're growing in an indoor or

82
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,920
outdoor location you may have different

83
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,680
microbes that you'd be of greater

84
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,039
concern but just because you're going in

85
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,879
one environment versus another does not

86
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,679
mean your canvas is completely immune to

87
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,000
the other

88
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,599
clattisporium may be an emerging problem

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,239
this fungus also infests

90
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,839
hemp mills as well so even not growing

91
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
the crop even storing the crop

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,878
can be an area where these microbes

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,199
could get hold

94
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,759
and start to proliferate about one

95
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,679
percent of cannabis supplies received

96
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,679
in harborside medical cannabis

97
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,239
dispensary in oakland california

98
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
were returned or basically rejected to

99
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,439
vendors because

100
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,560
unacceptable levels of aspergillium

101
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,318
contamination

102
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,239
so this is kind of what it looks like on

103
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,439
a kind of a zoomed in

104
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,959
level here's what it looks like a zoomed

105
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,000
in level is canadian these little spores

106
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,680
that break off

107
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,799
and it looks like it grows on a plate so

108
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
it doesn't like this on the actual

109
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
cannabis plant

110
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
might be hard to see without proper

111
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,759
microscope technology

112
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,200
but one percent of the supplies received

113
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,079
were rejected because of just

114
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,318
this is one uh microbial contaminant so

115
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,159
it is a real problem

116
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:48,958
now the american herbal of pharmacopoeia

117
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,000
our ahp protocols here they have theirs

118
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,840
listed

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,680
they have based on tests of commodity

120
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
for food products issued by the epa and

121
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,840
food and drug administration as well as

122
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,519
assays for cannabis used in holland for

123
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
orally consumed cannabis to hp

124
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,239
recommends

125
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,598
four tests total yeast and mold counts

126
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,000
total chloroforms

127
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,560
e coli and salmonella testing in

128
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,438
addition they recommend

129
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,039
immunochemical methods screen for

130
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,039
aflotoxins as well

131
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,798
for production to be inhaled the

132
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,759
astringent tests were recommended again

133
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,720
total yeast

134
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,959
total aerobic accounts bile tolerant and

135
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,560
gram negative bacteria e coli salmonella

136
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,360
and alpha toxin assays

137
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,199
the hp proposed specific limits in cfu

138
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,199
which is california units per gram

139
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
counts but emphasize that these values

140
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,680
do not represent the past fail criteria

141
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,280
rather they are recommended levels when

142
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
plants are cultivated and harvested

143
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,079
under

144
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,879
normal circumstances so it is important

145
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,599
to know europe

146
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,680
local regulations in the sense of what

147
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,759
they expect you to test what levels do

148
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,918
they set at the pass fail line

149
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,280
this is this is just providing one

150
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,279
example

151
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,599
looking at colorado as another example

152
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,799
here in 2015 color did update their

153
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,759
testing regimen

154
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,960
their total yeast or salmonella values

155
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,360
limited here

156
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,638
so this does not mean it contains no

157
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
someone or no yeast

158
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,680
they just set the limit here you to be

159
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,000
under this

160
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,240
theoretical limit here also there's

161
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,399
recommendations to test for different

162
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,439
for the three species of asp asperger

163
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,439
gillis here

164
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,639
although it was never implemented so

165
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,879
this is another thing you need to look

166
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,199
at

167
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,240
is what's proposed what's implemented

168
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,560
and what is

169
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,478
required and realize that these may

170
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,439
change from year to year so you have to

171
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,879
stay current

172
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,759
with whatever testing is required by the

173
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,279
state or agency you're looking at now

174
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
species detection

175
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,679
so for example with aspergillus it's a

176
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,279
large genus with 250 species and

177
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,840
separating three specific species from

178
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,159
the others

179
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,959
is not easy due to the challenges

180
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,360
associated with

181
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,519
species specific detection color changed

182
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,280
their testing requirements again in 2016

183
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,159
after they had just updated them

184
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,038
to a 10 000 cfu per gram total yeast in

185
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,280
mold test

186
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,199
but left in place to single cfu testing

187
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,679
for e coli and salmonella

188
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,960
so again important as a consumer also to

189
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,680
be aware of the testing

190
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,719
testing changes that may occur and going

191
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,439
back and looking

192
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,000
at the actual analytical report to be

193
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,759
that informed consumer is advised

194
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,839
here looking at the cfu's california

195
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,919
units basically do they grow on a plate

196
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,519
and we can see here they have a count

197
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,240
and they base that count per gram to

198
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,959
determine

199
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,519
whether or not it is above or below that

200
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,719
set

201
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,038
threshold level now we're also looking

202
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
at

203
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,318
pcr so this is polymerase chain reaction

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,800
as

205
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,000
is a very specific test here very

206
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,600
precise test

207
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,439
to accelerate the testing turnaround

208
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,120
time some labs are now using what's

209
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,079
called quantitative

210
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,079
pulmonary chain reaction or qpcr assays

211
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,959
which detects dna sequences in

212
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,519
cannabis samples the drawback of this

213
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,839
method

214
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,959
is that it's indifferent whether the

215
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,839
material is living

216
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,799
or non-living dna is testing dna if it's

217
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,119
present or not

218
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,840
to accommodate this an enrichment step

219
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,598
is performed

220
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,198
where the canvas samples are incubated

221
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,360
overnight in tbs broth

222
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,759
which is just a nutrient broth prior to

223
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,759
the pcr detection being run

224
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,598
overnight growth ensures that only

225
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,598
living organisms are measured

226
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,598
but raises questions of the overall

227
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,639
preferential cultural conditions

228
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,240
for broader total yeast in mold tests

229
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,079
to address this conundrum this kind of

230
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,280
challenge of like caught in between

231
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,560
some labs perform the pcr test on total

232
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,879
yeast and molds

233
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,120
and a positive result are confirmed with

234
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,839
an additional test extracted 24 hours

235
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,079
later

236
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,279
to ensure the signal from the

237
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,399
pre-incubated test

238
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,159
was in fact from live organisms

239
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,679
so again testing lab to try to figure

240
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
this out so that they're not getting

241
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,160
false results not giving false positives

242
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,280
or false negatives providing

243
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,120
quality results to consumers so you can

244
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,638
trust the test results that you're able

245
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,319
to get

246
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,759
and then lastly just figured i should

247
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,759
mention gamma radiation we're talking

248
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,720
about removing contaminants microbial

249
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,520
contaminants

250
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,360
using gaming radiation has been used uh

251
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,918
to basically

252
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,360
radiate microbial contaminations however

253
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,240
this doesn't mean counter

254
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,919
controversial and it may destroy

255
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,400
terpenes and does not destroy

256
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,159
mycotoxins important note there

257
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,120
microtoxins are unaffected by gamma

258
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,479
radiation

259
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,800
there's a study that was done that

260
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,120
looked at 10 000 grays of

261
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
in four cultivars for thc and cbd

262
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,360
dominant cannabis plants

263
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,280
levels of total thc and or cbd were not

264
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,840
altered by radiation treatments

265
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,119
in any of the cultivars tested compared

266
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,679
to controls

267
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,320
they did notice some degradation of

268
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,320
terpenes as kind of presented here

269
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,919
but they compared those reductions to

270
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,080
similar decreases arising from

271
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,319
short-term storage in a paper bag

272
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,839
as part of their general method of

273
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,800
testing so while there was

274
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
decreases compared to the known storage

275
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,079
conditions

276
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,639
they may not have been as bad as once

277
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
thought

278
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,240
that may just be a normal degradation

279
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,278
during the protocol

280
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,200
of testing process so just another

281
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,278
option even though controversial

282
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,360
figured i would mention it just to keep

283
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,360
you an informed consumer
