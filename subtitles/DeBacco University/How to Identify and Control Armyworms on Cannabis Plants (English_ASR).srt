1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,839
as the title implies on this tobacco

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,839
university video we're going to learn

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,679
how to identify and control army worms

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,679
in cannabis plants as well

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:17,149
as at the end seeing one actively

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:20,000
feeding on a cannabis plant

7
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:21,439
[Music]

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,198
all right let's get into how to identify

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,240
and control army worms on cannabis

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,800
plants

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,640
so first off the general description of

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,199
the army worm

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,200
when we're looking at the army worm

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,600
there's yellow striped army worms as we

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,840
can see in the above pictures

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,760
there's also the one of the largest this

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,520
is one of the largest

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,238
in most brightly marked of various

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,559
caterpillars that might be found on hemp

20
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,759
there is then also down here the beet

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,439
army worm

22
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,359
this is a caterpillar that feeds on

23
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,640
leaves and developing flowers

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,000
fruits seeds of a great many plants

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,719
we're going to see the one pictured

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,519
later of the yellow striped armyworm

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,120
variety here very distinctive coloration

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,040
and very aggressive feeder

29
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,959
this is the adult stage should be on the

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,720
lookout for that as well

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,879
as part of the general life cycle

32
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,599
looking at armyworms

33
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,920
so we look at the identification of them

34
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,000
it

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,920
is a generalist feeder that feeds on the

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,640
leaves of a wide variety of plants

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,759
it's not specific just to cannabis this

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,439
shows the adult beet armyworm

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,959
kind of moth and this shows the bee

40
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,879
armor and feeding on a hemp

41
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,000
flower so again very different

42
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,000
coloration than the yellow striped one

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,599
now managing armyworms just in general

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
here's that yellow striped one cultural

45
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,239
controls corn can be planted as a trap

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
crop

47
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,000
that will attract them to that you can

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,840
spray and control them on the corn

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,359
and hopefully they'll avoid feeding on

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
cannabis plants

51
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,118
tillage uh since overwintering occurs in

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
local soils

53
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,118
soils as a pupate tilling will help

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
destroy them and reduce their population

55
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,640
pressure for the following year

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,040
then there's also biological controls

57
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,000
which is the use of egg parasitoids

58
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
there's biofungus that can specticular

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,438
strains that can really attack them

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,439
and then as a last resort typically

61
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,878
there's insect and insecticides

62
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,400
biafran um as the active ingredient

63
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,639
now if you want to know just how quick

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
these can feed on a cannabis plant

65
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,799
i captured some video of them actually

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
feeding on a leaf and you can welcome to

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,760
view that

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,640
now all right in this video we see an

69
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,598
army worm eating a cannabis plant now

70
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,079
the audio

71
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,839
is not necessarily true to the actual

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
what's going on but we can see in real

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,439
time

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,598
just how aggressive one of these

75
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,759
caterpillars can basically be

76
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,518
these worms are how quick they can eat

77
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,039
and devour a plant

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,879
you can see here really close to the bud

79
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,039
so that's of course of concern

80
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,639
and usually where there's one well none

81
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,159
pictured in the image here

82
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,079
i'm sure there's a few more and this

83
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,719
implements more scouting as well as

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,719
control
