1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,580
here we're going to look at osteoporosis

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,690
and some other bone abnormalities now in

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,638
general looking at some of these

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,920
abnormalities we looking at weakening of

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,660
bone structure so here we have a normal

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,939
individual let's see the width of the

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,980
big you lie here that would be

8
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,890
considered normal and sadly this

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,140
individually a much thinner trabecula

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,260
here indicating these phones are more

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,699
likely to be fractured or broken than

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,730
the individual here which we're

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:34,170
considering to have a normal amount of

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:36,659
bone density and structure so these home

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,700
esthetic imbalances aasumal ages one of

16
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,859
these conditions this is where bones are

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,350
in adequately mineralized causing

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,539
softened and or weakened bones to

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,289
develop see that evident here in this

20
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,239
x-ray main symptom of this is pain that

21
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,100
when weight is put on the affected bones

22
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:54,149
we have these kind of inadequate

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,829
militarization is kind of small

24
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,410
fractures that may be occurring this can

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,270
cause pain to the individual what causes

26
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,968
this is insufficient calcium in the diet

27
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,948
or by vitamin D deficiency

28
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,750
now insufficient calcium in the diet

29
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:09,719
could mean that the individuals is not

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,409
consuming enough calcium or the calcium

31
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,090
the individual is consuming is not

32
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:18,409
bioavailable to the body it's not able

33
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,759
to be broken down and used in the bones

34
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:23,490
rickets is an extreme case of this and

35
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,379
this occurs in children where bones of

36
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:28,649
children are in adequately mineralized

37
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:31,618
causing softened and weakened bones both

38
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,680
legs and deformities in the pelvis skull

39
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:37,469
and rib cage are common with those

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,600
affected by rickets it's caused by the

41
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,400
same things we talked about earlier the

42
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,349
insufficient calcium the diet or by

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,939
vitamin D deficiency remember

44
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:46,949
insufficient calcium could be just a

45
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,209
total amount of calcium or the amount of

46
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,049
bioavailable calcium in the diet

47
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:54,419
osteoporosis you might be familiar with

48
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,640
or heard of before this is actually a

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,159
group of diseases in which bone we

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,259
absorption outpaces bone deposits

51
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,689
remember bonus constantin broken down

52
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,540
and repaired in this case it's being

53
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:09,179
broken down at a greater rate it's being

54
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,760
repaired at they should be about equal

55
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,318
and to maintain our normal bone here

56
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,289
here we have clearly

57
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,929
excessive osteoclast activity excessive

58
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:21,030
metal bit bro being broken down and the

59
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,700
normal bone remember the osteoblast and

60
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,620
osteoclast activity are both equal the

61
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,780
rate of breaking down is equal to the

62
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,810
rate of rebuilding in osteoporosis

63
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,590
specifically spongy bone of the spine is

64
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,959
most vulnerable this occurs most often

65
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,500
in postmenopausal women because of a

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,209
change in hormones and bones become so

67
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,818
fragile that sneezing or stepping off a

68
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,400
curb can cause fractures so again in

69
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:50,718
extreme cases even everyday activities

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,169
can cause bones to be fractured or

71
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:57,120
broken osteoporosis a single gene that

72
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:59,040
encodes for vitamin D docking determines

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,560
the tendency to accumulate bone mass

74
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,500
early in life and also the risk for

75
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,419
osteoporosis later in life see a nice

76
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,539
graph here of the years in age of an

77
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,219
individual in the bone mass bone mass is

78
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,400
measured in the total mass of skeleton

79
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:16,318
calcium in grams you see at a very young

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,900
age we see a dramatic increase in both

81
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,658
males and females and we see a

82
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,419
separation occur will peak bone mass and

83
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:28,019
males first run around the same age for

84
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:30,299
females at 25 - kind of 30 years old

85
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,509
however males bone mass peaks at a

86
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,879
higher rate than females after about age

87
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:37,458
40 we notice a decrease in bone mass

88
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,768
with age where both males and females

89
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:44,280
but after menopause for females we see a

90
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,680
dramatic rapid decrease in a level and

91
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,000
often a more consistent rate so that's

92
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,639
why females need a little bit more

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,060
concerned with osteoporosis but it still

94
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,370
can occur in males treatments for this

95
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,098
disease there's calcium and vitamin D

96
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,780
supplements again often you see vitamin

97
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,328
D with calcium to help the

98
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,468
bioavailability of that increased

99
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:09,030
weight-bearing exercises for individuals

100
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:12,288
hormones such as estrogen replacement

101
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,288
therapy or EVs

102
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:19,199
the pedestrian creams prompts new bone

103
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:21,509
growth so this can help reduce negative

104
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,870
impacts of osteoporosis and also

105
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:26,069
Stephan's increase bone mineral density

106
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,300
it's important to keep in mind these

107
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,459
hormones

108
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,800
and other treatments that they can be

109
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,109
side effects associated with these so

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,610
you have to outweigh some of the risks

111
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,680
actors with some of the potential

112
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:42,389
benefits PJ's disease here is a disease

113
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,699
of both that causes your bones to break

114
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:48,060
down too quickly thus caused your bite

115
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,709
to make to replace bone too quickly what

116
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,168
this is is it's bones breaking down

117
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:54,810
being rebuilt yeah too quick of a rate

118
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:56,789
as a result the replace bone is very

119
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,100
soft and brittle it's not has a lot of

120
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,510
structure to it it's not being made at

121
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,820
the pace it should be it's kind of being

122
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,740
slapped together really quick this and

123
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:07,168
occur in any bone in the body but it's

124
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,079
most common in the arms legs spine

125
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:12,719
pelvis in the skull it's most common

126
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,219
actually in cost Asian males with risk

127
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,350
increasing with the age of that

128
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,880
individual the interesting part is

129
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,650
there's really no cure and doctors

130
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,870
aren't really sure what causes this

131
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:23,699
disease but treatment revolves around

132
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,470
trying to slow the rate of decay and

133
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,870
trying to strengthen the existing bone

134
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,030
basically we want bone that's rebuilt to

135
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,579
have structure this is an extreme case

136
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:34,409
of it this is a much milder case but

137
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:36,750
that rebuilding bone too quickly and

138
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,330
cause it to be soft and brittle not the

139
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,410
integrity that we need to support our

140
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:44,639
body with our skeletal system

141
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,630
development aspects alone well the

142
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:52,079
mesoderm gives rise to embryonic these

143
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:54,000
in kiel cells which produce membranes

144
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,069
and cartilages that form embryonic

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,889
skeletons what's interesting about this

146
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:01,379
is the emmerich skeleton ossifies at a

147
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,449
very predictable time table this allows

148
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,699
the fetal age to easily be determined

149
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:09,740
from sonograms so if someone wasn't

150
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,519
exactly sure of the age of their baby

151
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,439
through sonograms

152
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,228
by looking at the degree of ossification

153
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,269
and then determine the age of that baby

154
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:20,879
that age determination can then

155
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:24,359
determine the date of conception and

156
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,850
potential date of birth so just an

157
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,250
interesting way through sonograms a

158
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,470
non-invasive kind of picture through

159
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,939
this predictable timetable can allow us

160
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:37,260
to determine the age of the unborn baby

161
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:40,589
more development aspects of bone at

162
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:44,310
birth most long bones are well ossified

163
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:47,159
during infancy of childhood the the seal

164
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:50,129
plate activity is stimulated by growth

165
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,530
hormone during purity testosterone and

166
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:55,829
estrogens can promote adolescent growth

167
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:58,889
spurts and can cause these bones to

168
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:01,469
continue to develop and ossify what's

169
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:02,819
important to remember is that by age 25

170
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:07,430
nearly all the bones are completely

171
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,579
ossified in old age bone reabsorption

172
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,189
predominates

173
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:13,649
so that resorption of bones that break

174
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:17,519
down a bone can kind of outpace the rate

175
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:20,579
at which bones are rebuilt lastly just

176
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:23,129
to kind of put that bone density and

177
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,169
regardless of age the environment and

178
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:27,689
individual lives in or participates and

179
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,520
can impact this typically an elder

180
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:32,730
person typically loses one to two

181
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,740
percent on loan every year meaning the

182
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,680
breakdown is greater than the rebuilding

183
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,870
but also regardless of age in space a

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,780
person suffers from about one to two

185
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,990
percent of bone loss every month however

186
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:48,089
this is mostly reversible that lack of

187
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:52,199
gravity that lack of compression on the

188
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:54,239
bone can reduce its density as a result

189
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,819
as perhaps we'll go on treadmills that

190
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,639
are kind of held down to help kind of in

191
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,889
create an impact to help pack in those

192
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,589
bones so that they try to lose as the

193
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,449
least amount as possible but one to two

194
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:08,489
percent of illness every month is quite

195
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:10,560
a bit considering an elderly person

196
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,540
loses that same right about every year

197
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,290
the advantage of when you go to space

198
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:19,650
and I had never been yeah look advantage

199
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,170
is that this is mostly reversible so

200
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:23,069
it's one of those things where

201
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:25,470
astronauts when they come back to earth

202
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,209
need to can can you know participate in

203
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,220
these types of trainings and exercises

204
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,219
so they can rebuild their bone yes
