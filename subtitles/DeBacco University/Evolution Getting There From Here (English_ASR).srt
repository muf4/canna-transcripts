1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,019
so here we look at evolution getting it

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:08,189
there from here kind of help in

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:11,910
explaining origin of certain structures

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:14,219
in organisms and certain species so

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,769
starting with evolution in general there

6
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,960
is looking at this we're seeing that

7
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:21,629
there's evidence of macro evolution

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,000
what macro evolution is is the

9
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:26,669
evolutionary change on a grand scale

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,490
large scale this encompasses the origin

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,390
of new species and major episodes of

12
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,479
extinction

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,659
so macro think just like this is large

14
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,979
scale changes micro evolution are

15
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,229
evolutionary changes as it would may

16
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,238
guess at a small scale so know

17
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,788
encompasses genetic changes that will

18
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,530
occur within populations over time these

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,100
traders are result of changes in gene

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,198
frequencies so we see here our gene

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,899
frequencies for certain colors have

22
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,698
changed in these butterfly wings here we

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,859
have the squirrel River grey squirrel or

24
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,439
black squirrel and our by now way to the

25
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,359
squirrel here this would be micro

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,789
evolutions it's simply a change in color

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,790
they're all still squirrels are all

28
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,710
still butterfly's wings here we're

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,659
seeing a micro evolution change this

30
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,149
could really impact whether or not an

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,859
individual can survive or not but still

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,659
it's considered a micro evolution a

33
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,359
small change versus a macro which is a

34
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,549
large-scale change so putting it

35
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,879
together Mac refers to changes in

36
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,890
tourism's over time that are so that are

37
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,618
so important that the neuro RISM would

38
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,030
be considered a whole new species that's

39
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,159
the best way to think of the macro

40
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,560
evolution microevolution and

41
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,320
macro-evolution both happened in the

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,478
same way and for the same reasons but

43
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,419
micro is more that kind of change in

44
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:48,688
coloration and macro is the potential

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,759
extinction or creation of a new species

46
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:52,219
there and that's our comparison between

47
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,079
the two

48
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:57,629
getting there from here so I'll mark

49
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,069
here many and many others prior to

50
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:01,500
Darwin and Wallace so that's different

51
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,239
if nothing prior to that theories

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,399
developed by those two thought

53
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,579
biological evolution occurred by what's

54
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,899
called in acquired characteristics it's

55
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,280
a treat that an organism develops

56
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,439
through interactions with the

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,319
environment in those past

58
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,719
ah spring body in behavior changes

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,340
acquired during their lives so I gave

60
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,469
some examples here and this is ends up

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,680
not being the case but for example the

62
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:27,030
manatee with the scars in the back this

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,920
happens usually with boats at one that

64
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,229
went into them sadly acquired

65
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,239
characteristics mean if all the manatees

66
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:34,979
had these scrape marks eventually they

67
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,510
would pass on these screen marks to

68
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,639
their offspring or individuals

69
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:40,859
if someone continually got pierced ears

70
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,369
eventually their offspring we would have

71
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,440
pierced ears naturally in the black

72
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,330
spots on the leaves here done to the

73
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,919
ostrogothic black spots and leaves this

74
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,600
is the concept of acquired

75
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,419
characteristics now again this is not

76
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,409
what happens but this is what mark

77
00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:00,509
thought and this is was his theory so in

78
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,939
contrast John and Wallace they proposed

79
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:05,819
variation is an inherent acara critics

80
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,949
of all biological populations so it's

81
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,479
not created by an experience it's

82
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:11,639
readily observed in all populations

83
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,729
again just look around the variants that

84
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,709
we have but the example here of um some

85
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:19,560
shells we see some different patterns

86
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,689
from different colorations it's the idea

87
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,270
that the body has a certain number and

88
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:26,459
amount of genes they get passed on to

89
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:30,510
the egg for the embryo to then develop

90
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,879
from our punnett squares and our kind of

91
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:35,699
odds of getting certain alleles and

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,650
combinations we see here again

93
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,509
number alleles for height it was very

94
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,980
short is very tall here's the mean the

95
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:46,229
average these acquired characteristics

96
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:48,299
do not hold true so I'm back here not

97
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:52,018
acquiring these characteristics right we

98
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:55,469
are variation based on genetics so

99
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,939
that's not created by experience that's

100
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:59,430
created by the genetics of the

101
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:03,569
individual not the experience that the

102
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,239
individual may or may not have so mark

103
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:08,099
again compared to Darwin the mark was

104
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,580
idea of the giraffes is for his primary

105
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:13,409
example so he came up with the idea that

106
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,900
by reaching higher for vegetation

107
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:18,750
giraffes simply stretch their necks and

108
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,180
as a result this results in them

109
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,399
acquiring longer necks in their

110
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,870
offspring Darwin believed that giraffes

111
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,689
were born longer necks and are better

112
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,569
able to survive and

113
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:31,160
for have more offspring who inherit

114
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:33,110
longer necks so again it's nice

115
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,960
comparison between these two scientists

116
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,840
at the time its holds true even today

117
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,609
the scientists that debate one another

118
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,889
so we need to support our ideas with

119
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,439
evidence and this is how we develop and

120
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,969
refine different theories so hallmarks

121
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,920
environmental roles is too much to

122
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,160
change in Darwin the environments role

123
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,050
as a selector the organisms role and

124
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,100
Lemax was active and Donnell it was

125
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,389
passive it's the genes that you get and

126
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,070
these didn't change and it's basically

127
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,110
regardless it's a slum gravan will

128
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:05,389
change regardless of what scientist you

129
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,639
look at the key part is here Darwin

130
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:11,389
believed in the inherent of genetics

131
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,979
mark Lydon acquired traits and inherent

132
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,699
it's definitely with the DNA the way

133
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,230
that this does occur evidence for

134
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,819
standard view of Darwin was that

135
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,460
evolutionary change occurred extremely

136
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,319
slowly and these changes accumulate such

137
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:27,049
that over thousands or millions of years

138
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,300
major changes could occur this term is

139
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,520
called gradualism and here's our horse

140
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,860
that I explained in the overview of

141
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,349
evolution we see how it's changed both

142
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,810
in size and structure but it's occurred

143
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,240
over a long period of time give the

144
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,189
examples of over millions of years we

145
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,220
can get these major changes that occur

146
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:47,329
they occur slowly and over time but over

147
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,630
these millions of years we get these

148
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:54,500
large changes that can occur let's refer

149
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:56,540
to the pace of evolution so punctuated

150
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,430
equilibrium hypothesis this is a blue

151
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,140
shape change occurs in bursts separated

152
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,540
by long periods of little or no

153
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,519
evolutionary change so we see here

154
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,250
gradualism where we're slowly getting a

155
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,899
lighter and lighter and lighter color

156
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,879
here punctuated equilibrium is where

157
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:13,159
things definitely diverge and change all

158
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,199
of a sudden we get a white one and that

159
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,660
white basically doesn't change for this

160
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,000
time period and we get the kind of the

161
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,919
more orange and red fish color you tan

162
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,810
color boom that changes that state is

163
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,849
pretty consistent for a long period of

164
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,280
time this is referred as punctuated

165
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:31,310
equilibrium gradualism refers to just

166
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,809
slowly that changed over time here

167
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,699
there's there's definitely these break

168
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,589
off points and while it's a white one

169
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:40,219
here it stays a white one here there's

170
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:42,139
not constant changing that's occurring

171
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,800
whose abrupt changes that occur in the

172
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:48,259
time scale so examples of both gradual

173
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,660
punctuated equilibrium to exist so

174
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,930
speciation clearly occurs in different

175
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:56,510
ways this would be the same example here

176
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,340
while starting with the green butterfly

177
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:00,439
and progressively these two colors with

178
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:03,169
gradualism and here's how it look with

179
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,819
punctuated equilibrium have the idea

180
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,270
that speciation is necessary and linked

181
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:10,099
to phenotypic change has not been

182
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:12,109
supported so we're seeing that

183
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,450
speciation can occur without phenotypic

184
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,310
change and phenotypic change can occur

185
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:19,879
within a species in the absence of

186
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,980
speciation so we're looking at that

187
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,750
morphological change we're not looking

188
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,250
in any of these cases at the genetics

189
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,490
we're just looking at the phenotypic

190
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,720
changes rate of replication different

191
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,939
organisms do with all the different

192
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,350
rates bacteria evolve much faster than

193
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:39,529
eukaryotes because they have a simpler

194
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:41,900
base pair unit in their genome so they

195
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:43,429
can occur much faster versus mammals and

196
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:45,949
fib using flowering plants in much

197
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,650
larger against base pairs many more base

198
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:51,199
pairs so it takes a lot longer for these

199
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:54,349
to change enough genes to cause a shift

200
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,000
in that organism in the rate of

201
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,439
evolution that punctuated equilibrium is

202
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,709
that branching that occurs and

203
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,079
gradualism is that steady change over

204
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:06,289
time the genome size again the base

205
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:09,259
pairs is more of a visual the mutation

206
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:12,110
rate and the genome size we see that the

207
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:16,389
larger the genome size them longer it

208
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:18,830
takes so viruses can change very quickly

209
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,959
and relatively speaking compared to

210
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:22,490
eukaryotes this is what makes viruses a

211
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,639
little bit harder to kind of combat

212
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:28,759
control because they can change from

213
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,319
year to year eukaryotes can also change

214
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,259
but it takes them millions of years a

215
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,750
lot slower rate of evolution still

216
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:38,599
occurs again it could be graduation or

217
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,360
the punctuated but the rate that the

218
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,240
change occurs is dependent on the

219
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,129
mutation rate which changes based on the

220
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,399
base pair or the number of base pairs

221
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:51,939
that individual organism has for DNA

222
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,939
sequences
