1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,640
so here we're gonna talk about

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:08,219
prokaryotic cells are very simple cells

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:12,058
notice on the inside not very complex

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,940
structures kind of mess of DNA here

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:17,009
located in the middle no membrane bound

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,868
organelles no high degree of

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,410
organization so these are considered

8
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:24,149
very basic or primitive cells so started

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,379
out there as simple organisms they're

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,839
simple because there's the lactose

11
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,788
membrane bound organelles no distinct

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,618
internal compartments those are found in

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,350
eukaryotic cells so for example a

14
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:37,350
nucleus you see a nucleus that's going

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,460
to be a eukaryotic cell here our DNA in

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,969
these cells doesn't mean they don't

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,969
contain DNA they still do but it's not

18
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:47,129
encapsulated in a nucleus I see here for

19
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,079
movement the flagellum or locomotion

20
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:50,579
thread-like structures for training

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,308
protruding to the cell surface

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,100
he coli bacteria is an example of a

23
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:58,468
prokaryotic cell inside in this case

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,170
10,000 times this give an idea what they

25
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,969
may look like in basic components

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,799
looking at defining characteristics

27
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,320
again no membrane bound organelles you

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,330
got the flagella here this area here

29
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,849
kind of looks like a bunch of noodles

30
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,978
kind of combined convinced here it's a

31
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:16,259
nucleotide we have our DNA basically

32
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:20,039
located here again no nucleus in

33
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,019
prokaryotes very simple so what are they

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,640
where they kind of compare here of our

35
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,618
eukaryote these are more membrane bound

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,170
organelles ProCare are actually two

37
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,759
categories or not just bacteria we

38
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,040
typically will associate with them as

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,890
bacteria they are well archaea is

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,710
another type of prokaryotic cell and

41
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,489
they live in extreme habitats example

42
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:43,739
here the kind of that yellow Yellowstone

43
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,599
National Park this bright color here is

44
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,679
because of archaea very stressful

45
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,048
conditions here and were able to

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,759
tolerate that I mean it structurally

47
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,829
similar but biochemically different than

48
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,689
some of the others but bacteria and

49
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:58,438
archaea both fall under under this line

50
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,359
of prokaryote some comparisons so the

51
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,949
archaea the bacteria in the you korea

52
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,810
we're gonna kind of leave these for

53
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,100
another section just focusing on these

54
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,500
two these are both prokaryotes

55
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,969
key part here for differences i'd be

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,169
looking at gene structure they're both

57
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,300
circular chromosomes

58
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,989
I like the you care that contain those

59
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,080
kind of

60
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,210
to find organelles which is in looking

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,520
at the interior cell structure there's

62
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,129
no memory Val in organelles or a nucleus

63
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,780
in both archaea and bacteria there are

64
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:27,919
several other differences but these are

65
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,879
kind of the main to looking at it here

66
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,089
structure of bacteria there's three

67
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:35,430
basic layers plasma membrane is one be

68
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,900
an extensive video on this but the snow

69
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,510
is a plasma membrane it's a lipid

70
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,490
bilayer two layers containing lipids

71
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:43,679
which is fats with embedded and

72
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,900
peripheral proteins and there's form the

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,599
internal pouches and allow for ranking

74
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,659
the cell recognition for communication

75
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,879
for exchange of nutrients losing of

76
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:57,240
waste products again this member this

77
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,430
plasma membrane here it's occurring also

78
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,840
there's a cell wall that maintains the

79
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,159
shape of the cell and it's transmitted

80
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,469
by this thing called have to look like

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,659
tin and the glycocalyx which is

82
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:09,210
basically a sugar coat glycol referring

83
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,819
to like glucose and KX printers to coat

84
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,520
this is a layer of polysaccharides on

85
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,449
the outer portions and cell wall

86
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,189
well-organized and resist removal from

87
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:19,429
the capsid so this area here is

88
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,990
peptidoglycan you see these kind of big

89
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,790
mouthed macromolecules kind of joined

90
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,219
together it's in the example with

91
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:27,780
structure for bacteria another video I

92
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:30,449
have on grams gram staining we'll go

93
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,909
over some of this more structure

94
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:39,239
bacteria how to get the shape sphere

95
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:41,759
achill shape a Cox I hear Cox's bacilli

96
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,060
or bacillus and it's beryllium here

97
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,919
different types of shapes we can use

98
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,319
these to help identify certain bacterial

99
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,299
structures the Gram stain is important

100
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,039
in helping identify these are examples

101
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,040
of Graham saying how can look at the

102
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,079
shape of different bacteria certain

103
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:01,079
structures of the cytoplasm get a

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,810
cytoplasm is semi fluid solution it's in

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,550
the plasma membrane contains water inner

106
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,629
inorganic and organic molecules and

107
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,880
enzymes are located there

108
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,939
again this is a eukaryotic cell but just

109
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,439
give you an idea of where it's located

110
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:15,240
new clearly didn't our prokaryotes is a

111
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,180
region that contains a single circular

112
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,250
DNA molecule example here so we say a

113
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,650
circle right it's kind of folded on

114
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,259
itself so it's not a perfect circle but

115
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:26,429
if we were to kind of unfold this it is

116
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,740
in the circular

117
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,319
versus the chromosomes that be found in

118
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,019
eukaryotic cells plasmids are small

119
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,089
accessory extra chromosome rings of the

120
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,279
DNA so these are true circles they

121
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:41,638
typically are smaller than the total

122
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:44,369
bacterial DNA or genome you can

123
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,019
structure of the cytoplasm here you see

124
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,800
where everything is located in certain

125
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:51,508
so labeled here again that DNA here kind

126
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,900
of that circle is kind of folded on

127
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:57,180
itself with this little circle structure

128
00:04:54,899 --> 00:05:00,179
of the appendages of these prokaryotes

129
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,360
flagella provide the motility again they

130
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,009
can have one flagella or many they're

131
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,038
both serving the same purpose we have to

132
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,840
move the cell the timbre or small

133
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:13,228
bristle like fibers that sprout from the

134
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,469
cell surface and their purpose is to

135
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:17,579
enable sales to adhere to animal tissues

136
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,690
different than cilia so a lot of

137
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,949
students confuse them with cilia they'll

138
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:22,379
affect needs kind of protrusions here

139
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:25,110
these are specifically allow them to

140
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,259
adhere to animal tissues cilia are used

141
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:32,009
for locomotion prokaryotes isla del for

142
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:34,949
their primary form of movement six glide

143
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:36,509
another type of thick of structure

144
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,819
that's on prokaryotes particularly

145
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:41,899
bacteria and these kind of structures

146
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:45,300
that allow DNA to pass from cell to cell

147
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:47,668
so for example if this plasmid is

148
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,530
advantageous for the environment example

149
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:52,680
it could be antibiotic resistance cell

150
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:55,138
gate anti body resistant bacteria well

151
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,908
these bacteria can communicate these

152
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:03,569
pillows here joins the two bacteria our

153
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:07,038
plasmid is replicated and it is passed

154
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:09,930
through this pill I and now this other

155
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,810
bacteria now has for example three

156
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,579
seasons to back to a certain antibiotic

157
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,158
so the bacteria then can proliferate and

158
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:20,848
basically take over and this is how we

159
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:23,699
get the formation of antibiotic

160
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:25,860
resistant bacteria again just a quick

161
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,990
overview of the cell of a prokaryotic

162
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,400
cell again a identifies some of certain

163
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,680
parts look at some of certain structures

164
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:34,168
and I had to become and you compare

165
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,150
prokaryotes to eukaryotes and see the

166
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:38,750
similarities but also the differences

167
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:38,750
between the two
