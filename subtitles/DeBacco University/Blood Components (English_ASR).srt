1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
here we're gonna look at blood

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,939
components now if you've ever had blood

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,490
drawn and put into a vial you know it's

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,410
this kind of dark red liquid maybe think

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,300
too oh it transports oxygen there's

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,009
actually different components that we're

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,780
going to investigate further so you can

8
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,510
develop a greater understanding to the

9
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,129
components that make up blood

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,840
all of those composers four major ones

11
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,239
we're going to focus on one is plasma

12
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,009
that's the liquid portion that contains

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,469
two South nutrients hormones and gases

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,630
and comprised about 55% of the total

15
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,159
blood the red blood cells or over

16
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,829
Thersites they're the ones responsible

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,558
for transporting oxygen and also carbon

18
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,079
dioxide white blood cells or leukocytes

19
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,628
are important for the body's immune

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,850
system and platelets help the body form

21
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,799
blood clots this is what it will look

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,270
like after I centrifuge you can see

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,488
there's definitely distinctive yellow

24
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,690
clears to whitest region and in the dark

25
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:57,000
red portion now blood is the body's only

26
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,979
fluid tissue it's got a metallic taste

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,948
it's kind of sticky it goes from a

28
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,029
scarlet red to a dark red never is blood

29
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:05,368
a blue color

30
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,769
it's pH is kept in a tight range between

31
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:10,049
seven point three five and seven point

32
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,359
four five it's temperature is slightly

33
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,180
higher than normal body temperature and

34
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:18,599
it accounts for approximately 8% of the

35
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,490
body's weight for males it's about five

36
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,030
to six liters of blood for a females

37
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,789
about four to five liters that plasmid I

38
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,320
mentioned that kind of a yellow portion

39
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,110
blood plasma contains over a hundred

40
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:34,649
solutes including proteins non-protein

41
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:37,409
nitrogen substances organic nutrients

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,079
electrolytes and respiratory gases and

43
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,340
is that yellowish kind of color to it so

44
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,798
it contains everything from sodium

45
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,680
potassium glucose lactic acid clotting

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,729
proteins oxygen carbon dioxide a whole

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,649
bunch is found in blood plasma formed

48
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:54,569
elements so our birth recites leukocytes

49
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,728
and platelets make up the formed

50
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,769
elements only white blood cells are

51
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,629
complete cells red blood cells actually

52
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,209
have no nuclei or organelles and

53
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:05,670
platelets are just cell fragments we see

54
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,769
those here most formed elements survive

55
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,628
in the bloodstream only a few days most

56
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,180
blood cells do not divide but are

57
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,280
renewed by cells in the bone marrow

58
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,860
excuse a little kind of compares

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,159
and what they kind of look like here the

60
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,380
erythrocytes are the red blood cells 99%

61
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:24,289
of the blood cellular component thereby

62
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:26,209
concave discs because this is them a

63
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:29,269
very high surface area to volume ratio

64
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:31,789
and very important for the nutrient as

65
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,430
well as gas exchange that there's so

66
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:36,500
needed to do they're also in a nucleate

67
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,110
betweens a looser nucleus at maturity

68
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,459
and have essentially no organelles their

69
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,260
fill of hemoglobin which is a protein

70
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:45,590
that functions for gas transport

71
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:47,719
responsible for the red color and the as

72
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,269
they move through the circulatory system

73
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,459
here they have a special protein that

74
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:55,489
helps give them flexibility so they're

75
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:57,739
able to move through the veins and the

76
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,509
arteries quite well and they can change

77
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:02,239
shape is necessary but they will always

78
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:04,310
kind of maintain overall that biconcave

79
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,610
disc to allow high surface area to

80
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,500
volume ratio erythrocytes are red blood

81
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,050
cells lifespan they live about four

82
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,629
months iron from hemoglobins recycled in

83
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:17,269
liver and spleen and the hormone

84
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,739
erythropoietin is made in the kidneys

85
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,379
and it stimulates the production of red

86
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,759
blood cells in the bone marrow one red

87
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,919
blood cell contains about a billion

88
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:27,078
molecules of oxygen that's some fun

89
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,208
facts here where blood cells take about

90
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:31,670
twenty seconds to circulate over the

91
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,769
body one time and they circulate for

92
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,238
about a hundred and twenty days there

93
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,730
are millions of red blood cells in one

94
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,700
drop of blood and two to three million

95
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:41,810
red blood cells are made each second so

96
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:44,509
I'm not going to go too much into the

97
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,310
details the lifespan but you could see

98
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:48,919
red blood cells you might be taking for

99
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,579
granted how many there are and the

100
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:54,289
necessary function that they produce

101
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,599
they said they have about 100 and 120

102
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:59,120
day lifespan older overthrow sites

103
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,150
become rigid and fragile and their

104
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,969
hemoglobin begins to degenerate both

105
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,289
making them basically non-functional

106
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:07,909
during the ever Thersites are engulfed

107
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:10,969
by macrophages that's when they're dying

108
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:13,250
and they're kind of engulfed and cleaned

109
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:15,379
up that way heme and globin are

110
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,238
separated and the iron is salvaged for

111
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:18,379
reuse so the body's not just going to

112
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,060
gulp them and completely break them

113
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,858
apart throw them away it's gonna use

114
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,120
some of the components it's important

115
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,149
remember that red blood cells do not

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,000
grow do that divide and do not make any

117
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:30,769
new protein

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,810
myoglobin is a protein found in muscle

119
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:34,818
cells as you could see here are darker

120
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,519
red meat contains a greater amount of

121
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:39,949
myoglobin they provide oxygen to active

122
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,689
muscles it's very similar to something

123
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:43,579
that might be more formal tema globin

124
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:45,769
and it binds to oxygen tighter than

125
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:47,478
human globins we see here here's our

126
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:49,728
pressure in millimeters of mercury and

127
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:51,860
we see our my level and shoots up very

128
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:52,689
quickly so by ohms oxygen tighter than a

129
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,439
McGlothlin

130
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:57,589
we'll notice here are two different

131
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,120
types of hemoglobin HF is referring to

132
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,519
fetal hemoglobin which is a little more

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,189
efficient at binding oxygen and adult

134
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,769
hemoglobin here but all perform the same

135
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:08,990
basic function looking specifically at

136
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:11,240
hemoglobin is a complex protein made up

137
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:15,050
of four protein strands these different

138
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,759
peptide chains iron is used to form the

139
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,460
heme groups that's what's responsible

140
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,169
for the oxygen binding because it's a

141
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:23,538
protein shaped is very important when

142
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:25,878
you can see pH will also impact the

143
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:30,408
ability for hemoglobin to be able to

144
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:33,020
bind oxygen so here 7.4 and ere 7.2

145
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:35,959
decrease in pH causes a greater release

146
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:37,848
of oxygen so at seven point four humans

147
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:41,060
more efficient at binding oxygen than at

148
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:44,209
page seven point two platelets as I

149
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,689
mentioned our fragments and they do not

150
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:49,758
contain a nucleus grains and they

151
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:51,649
basically function for the clotting

152
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,439
purposes so you see this kind of like

153
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:56,120
web here that forms the mechanism by

154
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,699
forming temporary plug that helps seal

155
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,439
breaks in blood vessels they also play a

156
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:03,710
key role in the formation of them I've

157
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,930
written in fibrinogen and they're that

158
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:08,239
responsible for that kind of webbing and

159
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,918
that's what's helping block the chapter

160
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,528
trap the red blood cells in here

161
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,810
preventing continuous bleeding to from

162
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:16,550
occurring kind of shows a little

163
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,560
pictorial here damaged blood vessel

164
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,840
injury here's our red blood cells

165
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,120
leaving activate the platelets start to

166
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,369
bind and kind of make a little plug here

167
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,168
and then we see our fibrin strands

168
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,329
carrying that netting really kind of

169
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:32,839
sealing that area off from the red blood

170
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:34,250
cells escaping as well as from potential

171
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,258
invaders from the outside of the body

172
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,500
getting in to the body in the blood

173
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:40,729
stream there's two different types of

174
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,949
anemias there

175
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:46,550
Organic anemia which is the result of

176
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:48,588
acute or chronic blood loss and both of

177
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,139
these are insufficient red blood cells

178
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:52,879
for hemoglobin in the body so you could

179
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:55,069
have that insufficient by just simply

180
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:57,408
losing a lot of blood or having an iron

181
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:59,210
deficiency which is a secondary result

182
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:01,038
of hemorrhage and anemia inadequate

183
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:03,198
intake of iron containing foods can also

184
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,478
contribute to this an impaired iron

185
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,740
absorption so here we see our normal

186
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:09,248
levels we have our storage and our

187
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,598
transport then we have an iron depletion

188
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:13,819
we have iron deficiencies

189
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,490
if iron deficient anemia as we notice

190
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:18,408
that transporting functional iron

191
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:22,038
decreases at a much greater rate you can

192
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:24,968
see the suggested rates four grams per

193
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:27,378
liter for females and males close

194
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:29,538
typically needed a little bit more for

195
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:31,490
males and this is our progressive of

196
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:35,628
iron depletion this is a much worse case

197
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,009
than here sickle-cell anemia may have

198
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:38,389
heard of that before it's where red

199
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,120
blood cells basically lose their

200
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,189
biconcave disk shape and causes sickle

201
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,158
shaped and that's a defective gene

202
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:48,319
encoding for abnormal hemoglobin it's a

203
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,998
single amino acid substitution so you

204
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,310
can see our normal protein being made

205
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:55,189
here and here's a single amino acid

206
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:58,098
substitution resulting in a mutant amino

207
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:00,560
acid causing in a mutant protein its

208
00:07:58,098 --> 00:08:02,990
shape has changed the defect caused red

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,098
blood cells have a sickle shape and low

210
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:09,348
oxygen absorbing qualities and also this

211
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:11,718
sickle shape does not allow it to free

212
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:15,860
flow through the veins and arteries as

213
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:18,889
well lastly we have the blood groups

214
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,189
and is referring to Group A has eight

215
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:25,189
antigens Group B is B antigens group a B

216
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:27,528
as a and B antigens in group O has no

217
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:29,990
antigens this is used for classifying

218
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:33,198
blood types this is where people may say

219
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:35,299
they're a B or a B or auto types this

220
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:39,288
also could be a positive or B positive

221
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:41,899
that refers to Rh factors which is

222
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:43,939
stands for rhesus factors there so that

223
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:45,769
gives you a general overview of the

224
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,220
blood and the different components that

225
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:48,220
it contains
