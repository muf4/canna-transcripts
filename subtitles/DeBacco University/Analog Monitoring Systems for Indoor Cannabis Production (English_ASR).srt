1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,559
so even though analog monitoring systems

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,599
may be considered kind of an old way of

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,519
doing things

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,199
in this tobacco university video i'm

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,359
going to cover why they may still be

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:17,920
utilized and why growers may choose to

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,919
use them over digital systems

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,880
[Music]

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,118
all right let's get into analog

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,320
monitoring systems for indoor cannabis

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,800
production

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
so starting with the advantages of an

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,160
analog monitoring system is

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,920
first one being it's the simplified

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,199
mechanics they're reliable and less

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
prone to failure

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
and they also tend to be less expensive

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,679
compared to digital

19
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,320
monitoring systems all these are great

20
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,359
attraction points to many growers

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,759
the analog systems are simple they are

22
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,359
just

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,039
kind of a little bit of that kind of

24
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,479
fail-safe end of things

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,800
definitely allowing that kind of

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,398
repeatability because it can translate

27
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,320
to simple purchase setup and go

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,558
operations there's no need to calibrate

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,480
standardized in some cases

30
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,158
they just kind of are right there and

31
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,478
kind of in your face

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,280
with many other complications in a grow

33
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,039
facility

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,960
having this simplicity is a critical

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,560
piece of environmental monitoring

36
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,000
can be welcomed to many growers

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,118
especially if you're looking at just

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,799
quick reading at what's the temperature

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,680
what's the humidity having an analog

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,799
system

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,439
can be advantageous in that regards also

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,520
the analog

43
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,118
is simple the reliability analog

44
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,280
monitoring systems do their simplicity

45
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,438
are often less prone to failure

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
digital sensors can fail unexpectedly

47
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,319
where analog signage will work with

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,640
basic mechanics

49
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,879
so the likelihood of unexpected failure

50
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
is less than a digital operation

51
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,599
give the comparison of these two

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,079
different phone types the digital phone

53
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,559
and more

54
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,759
analog phone how many times in the last

55
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,200
10 years

56
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,959
have people gone through and had to

57
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
change out their digital phones

58
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,478
when these old style rotary analog

59
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,280
phones can last for 10

60
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,840
20 30 potentially up to 50 years and

61
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,280
still be

62
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,920
operational so also in addition

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,759
we have to consider price points with

64
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,200
many expenses of a growing operation

65
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,560
saving some money and a monitoring

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
system can be important

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
in analog systems if set up properly

68
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,000
will not perform

69
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,599
any less than the competing digital

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,280
system while there may be some

71
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,598
features missing compared to a digital

72
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,239
system analog monitors can still provide

73
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,959
growers

74
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,959
important information so this is why

75
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,598
they can still be utilized in some grow

76
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,719
facilities very effectively

77
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:29,199
well where analog monitors are and are

78
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,479
not recommended so if you're going with

79
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,159
an analog system

80
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,840
typically i really wouldn't recommend it

81
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,280
if you're looking at ph or carbon

82
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,080
dioxide enrichment or looking at light

83
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,598
levels

84
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
they're more advantageous for just the

85
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,199
temperature humidity just to give you an

86
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,719
idea of where those

87
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,238
typical environmental factors are around

88
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,318
lastly i want you to remember with

89
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
digital and as well as analog

90
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,079
is that the sensor is only as good as

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
the placement so watch the other video

92
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,360
here to make sure you're placing your

93
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,439
sensor in the right location

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,120
so regardless of what system you're

95
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,560
using you're getting an accurate and

96
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,560
reliable reading
