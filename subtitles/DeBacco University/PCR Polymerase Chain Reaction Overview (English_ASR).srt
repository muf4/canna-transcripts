1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,720
here i'll be going over the pcr overview

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,000
which stands for polynomial's chain

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:10,638
reaction and what this basically is is

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,359
a way and efficient way to amplify

5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,279
sections

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,800
of dna so again what is pcr

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,320
well pcr stands for plenus chain

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,160
reaction it's an in

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,600
vitro technique used for the application

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,439
of a region of dna

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,800
whose sequence is known or which lies

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,518
between two regions of

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,599
a known sequence so it's taking not just

14
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,000
the whole dna necessarily taking a

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,159
small portion and amplifying that

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,799
particular region of the dna

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,238
it does this many times and it can

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,479
really amplify

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,878
exponentially the amount of dna

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,038
fragments that are produced

21
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,718
so what made this possible was one

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,840
particular key discovery

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,079
this hedis discovery was actually

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,680
occurred in yellowstone national park

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,920
you may think about what what does that

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,519
have to do with a laboratory technique

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,160
used for microbiology

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,239
and biochemistry well it's a thermia

29
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,878
stable bacteria was found so in the hot

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,679
springs

31
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,359
of the elson national park we found a

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,000
heat tolerant polymerase

33
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,079
which prevents denaturing in the running

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,640
of multiple cycles of this pcr

35
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,679
site of this pcr process at high

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
temperatures

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,280
so the pcr requires these high

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,159
temperatures most dna polymerases would

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,159
denature

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,240
and would lose their function however

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,479
here this bacteria in this hot springs

42
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,798
has found to have a thermally or a heat

43
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,759
stable polymerase allowing for this pcr

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
process to be

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,719
able to carry it on this polymerase is

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,759
an isolated and is known as now

47
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,359
tac polymerase so some of the required

48
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,599
components for pcr

49
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:47,359
our dna template primers enzymes

50
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,679
dtmps magnesium and some buffers and all

51
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,560
these are mixed in that little tiny tube

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,880
to allow the pcr process to go through

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
its natural sequence

54
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,399
so starting with that dna template well

55
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,279
it's dna containing a region to be

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,439
sequenced

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,399
the size of target dna can be amplified

58
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,398
up to three

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,439
kilobases so again looking at that

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,118
that's the whole dna

61
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,560
we're looking at a section of that the

62
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,479
template of that

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,080
so we have this kind of primers that are

64
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,640
going to match up that

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
to that dna template and these primers

66
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,119
are going to be used to match up with

67
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,719
that template are usually 20 to 30

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
nucleotides long

69
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,039
synthetically produced and complement to

70
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,199
the three prime ends of the target dna

71
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,639
so you've got that whole sequence of dna

72
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,399
we only want a small portion of it so we

73
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,039
use primers to kind of

74
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,599
initiate that area where that target

75
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,239
sequence

76
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,439
is located two sets of primers on that

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,200
are not complementary to each other are

78
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,120
used because remember we have those

79
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,560
two strands to our dna we have an

80
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,759
upstream and a downstream primer that

81
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,400
will be utilized

82
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,840
40 to 60 gc that's guanine cytosine

83
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
content is preferred for better

84
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
annealing because those have

85
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,479
three hydrogen bonds so they're able to

86
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,680
hold together a little tighter

87
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,759
the temperature of primers can be

88
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,400
calculated based on the nucleotides

89
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,840
if it's a lot of g to c bonds as three

90
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
allele higher temperature

91
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,080
if it's an a to t bonds it'll have two

92
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
hydrogen bonds a little less temperature

93
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
this would be outlined in a protocol so

94
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,439
that attack polymerase that i mentioned

95
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,679
it's important

96
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,878
well this tacular base or really any one

97
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,599
of the natural or recombined

98
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,679
thermostable polymerases need to be used

99
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,719
it's stable at temperatures up to 95

100
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,040
degrees celsius

101
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,639
and furnace does not have proofreading

102
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,679
which is one downfall

103
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,439
but we're not looking at really

104
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,799
replicating these dnas to be utilized in

105
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,359
the cell we're looking at them to be

106
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,200
used

107
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
to be run in for example gel

108
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,119
electrophoresis

109
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,200
now the pcr cycle is a cycle that does

110
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,959
repeat it's comprised of three steps

111
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,719
we have the denaturation step where we

112
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,360
increase the temperature to about 95

113
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,039
degrees

114
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
that causes our double stranded dna to

115
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,318
kind of separate then we have the primer

116
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,080
hybridization where we cool the

117
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
temperature down a little bit to anneal

118
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,319
those primers get those primers to stick

119
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,840
on

120
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,280
to those since separated dna sequences

121
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,120
and then we have the dna synthesis

122
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,400
primer extension we're kind of going

123
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280
through we heat it back up to speed up

124
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,879
the process

125
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,799
and we have those dna sections extended

126
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,399
and then replicated and we'll go through

127
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,719
a repeat of this process again

128
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,158
and again now that first part that i

129
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,318
mentioned the denature

130
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,840
of the template stream dna by heat in 95

131
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:10,479
degrees it's taking our double stranded

132
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
dna

133
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,639
heating up so it's denatured so it's

134
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,680
being separated it could be 90 to 95

135
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,519
degrees celsius

136
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,959
depending on the specific region

137
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,199
depending on the

138
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,120
a to t bonds or g to c bonds presence

139
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,800
and the percentage of those

140
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,120
then we have the temperature is then

141
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,240
lowered and the primers are annealed to

142
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
the target sequence

143
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,120
so if we kept the temperature at 95

144
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,560
everything we bounced it around so quick

145
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,280
those primers would not be able to

146
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,360
anneal

147
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,359
here we cool down to 45 to 60 degrees

148
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
celsius to give a chance for those

149
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,639
primers

150
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,720
to stick onto the initial starting point

151
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,759
of this target dna sequence

152
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
the reason why there's a range of

153
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,560
temperatures again it depends on how

154
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
many

155
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
what percentage of g and c bonds that

156
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,918
may be present or a and t

157
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,600
bonds step three at 72 degrees celsius

158
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,519
the attack

159
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
dna polymerase catalyzes the primer

160
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,879
extension as complementary nucleotides

161
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,719
are incorporated

162
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,918
so we heat up to approximately 72

163
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
degrees celsius

164
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,319
and this allows these nucleotides this

165
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,080
polymerase to go through and attach

166
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,639
these nucleotides to now

167
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,279
make two new double-stranded sections of

168
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,720
dna

169
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,638
over that target sequence and this is

170
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,240
the end of the first cycle

171
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,680
so the end result is two copies of the

172
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,038
target dna sequence

173
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
seems like a lot of work to go through

174
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,639
this that one little cycle

175
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,840
however once we go through the second

176
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,720
and the third

177
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,279
fourth and the fifth this increase

178
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
becomes

179
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,918
exponential so we typically rarely do

180
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
you see a pcr one for

181
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,599
more than three to forty cycles because

182
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,918
you have

183
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
literally millions of copies of dna at

184
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,198
that stage

185
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,720
so this target amplification as i

186
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,639
mentioned uh

187
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
this is an exponential implication in

188
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,280
dna so how does that look well here's

189
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,800
our first cycle

190
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,599
then each one of those are separates we

191
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,840
get four copies and we go to 8 to 16 to

192
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,479
32 to so on and so forth

193
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,279
at 40 cycles if you reach that number of

194
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,399
cycles

195
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:07,439
you can get about 1000 billion copies

196
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,198
from just ideally one original template

197
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,959
strand of dna

198
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,360
so this is kind of that standard

199
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,000
thermocycle as i said 94 95 degrees to

200
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
denature

201
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
only about 45 seconds at that

202
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,720
temperature then we cool it down for

203
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,840
about another 45 seconds to allow those

204
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,919
primers to anneal

205
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,359
heat it up to 72 degrees celsius for

206
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,439
about again under a minute

207
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,120
let extension phase to occur and then

208
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,800
repeat and repeat repeat

209
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,959
at the very end it will chill down to

210
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,360
four degrees celsius and hold

211
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,918
there until you go through and pull your

212
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,439
samples out of the thermocycler

213
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,959
as i said this is an exponential

214
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,560
increase to try to give you an idea of

215
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,120
these pcr cycles this shows the

216
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,199
temperature

217
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,639
fluctuations that do occur this kind of

218
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
gives you a visual representation of

219
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,038
what's going on

220
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
and it shows you the number of pcr

221
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,318
cycles the number of target copies of

222
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,639
that dna template that are made

223
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,598
you can see initially go 2 to 4 to 8 to

224
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,918
16

225
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,360
and dramatically will increase if we go

226
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,839
to 30 cycles here

227
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,560
you can see just exponentially how many

228
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,159
more cycles

229
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,199
based on those cycles how many more dna

230
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,639
sequences we are able to get

231
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,840
now this is great when we have a lot of

232
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,598
samples you think why would you want

233
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,318
that many samples what really makes it

234
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,639
easy for the next step which is gel

235
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,879
electrophoresis

236
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,319
this is the sequence of using those

237
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,000
amplified fragments

238
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,439
run through a gel and then going through

239
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,120
the southern blot process

240
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,800
to be able to visualize those for

241
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,598
comparisons

242
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,879
this pcr amplification the genome

243
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,159
mapping and gene function is

244
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,000
determination

245
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,880
biodiversity studies that can be used

246
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,879
for or evolutionary studies diagnostics

247
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,639
parental testing genetic diseases early

248
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,918
detection of cancer viral infections

249
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,639
many things like that

250
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,959
detection for drug resistance forensics

251
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,560
dna can be used for dna fingerprinting

252
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,560
so you can see that this same basic

253
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,280
process can be used for many

254
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,478
potential applications the general

255
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,959
advantages of

256
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,959
pcr that's automated it's fast it's

257
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,399
reliable to reproducible results

258
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,279
once you purchase the machine which can

259
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,560
get expensive it's all self-contained

260
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,399
and you basically can

261
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,079
set all everything up dial everything in

262
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,000
basically walk away

263
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,279
it's also very contained it's used not

264
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,038
using a lab bench

265
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,799
there's less chance for contamination to

266
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,680
occur it's a very high output

267
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,560
sensitive it's broad use defined and

268
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
easy to follow

269
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,918
protocols if you're starting in a

270
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,800
microbiology type lab if you're talking

271
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,639
kind of a

272
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
genomics lab odds are going to be

273
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,598
running some form of pcr

274
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,720
because of all of these advantages it

275
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,679
does become very

276
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,680
widely used and is very much an accepted

277
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,478
and a good protocol to learn to be able

278
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,478
to perform
