1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
this video is going to show a

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:07,528
hardy-weinberg application involved with

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:11,160
sickle-cell anemia and why this is not

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:13,169
following what we might expect so

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,509
looking at sickle cell anemia what it is

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:18,570
an inherent mutation of the genetic code

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:21,329
in hemoglobin hemoglobin remember is

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,850
oxygen carrying the blood protein the

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,639
recessive allele is this H with this s

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,429
and this double s here the normal allele

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,830
would be the B so this s and this s is

12
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:33,869
standing for sickle-cell low oxygen

13
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:35,339
levels cause red blood cells to sickle

14
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,349
which is this kind of shape here as you

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,149
see indicated here this is a normal red

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,550
blood cell maintaining a very high

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,829
surface area to volume ratio you see the

18
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:46,558
sickle shape is not really the protein

19
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,989
formed in the proper shape not aligned

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,849
to its proper function breaks down a red

21
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:53,488
blood cells clotting small blood vessels

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,730
damaged organs can often be lethal so

23
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,858
you do not want sickle-cell it's because

24
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,858
is a very short life expectancy

25
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,219
however the alleles for this still exist

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,250
we're talk about why so high frequency

27
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:10,829
of heterozygotes one in five in central

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,260
Africans are heterozygotes for

29
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:17,188
sickle-cell we have a normal allele and

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,109
also a sickle cell allele unusual for an

31
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:21,569
allele with severe detrimental effects

32
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,150
in the homozygotes so one that of a

33
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:26,069
hundred individuals will be homozygous

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,618
for sickle cell and they usually die

35
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:31,019
before we productive age meaning these

36
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,909
genes are typically not passed on so

37
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,798
this kind of brings the question of why

38
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,570
is the sickle cell allele maintained in

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,820
such a high levels in African

40
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,319
populations this suggests or some

41
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:43,859
selective advantage for being a

42
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,469
heterozygote so why is that investigate

43
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:49,649
that a little bit here so first off just

44
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:52,438
quick general malaria it's a parasite

45
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,829
it's transmitted by mosquitoes causes a

46
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:58,648
bunch of negative symptoms can often

47
00:01:55,828 --> 00:02:00,199
lead to death see here it's a life stage

48
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,868
that it goes through it is blood-borne

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,180
and it does multiply in the human body

50
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:09,330
and again transmitted the parasite at

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,120
least by mosquito bite be very deadly

52
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,890
and a single-celled eukaryotic parasite

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,659
spends part of its life cycle in red

54
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,609
blood cells and that's what causes here

55
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,079
or mass multiplication that then a

56
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,680
mosquito will bite someone who's

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,319
infected and spread it to another person

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,920
so sickle cell anemia this was first

59
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:30,629
detected in December 31st in 1904 sickle

60
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,849
cell anemia is a hereditary disease

61
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,680
affecting hemoglobin molecules in the

62
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,180
blood so initially might be asking well

63
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,010
how does this relate to the malaria I

64
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,810
just talked about you'll see how this

65
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,810
connects the sickle cell mutation

66
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,120
changes six amino acid in the immigrant

67
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,310
chain this causes hemoglobin molecules

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,709
to clump in normal red blood cells the

69
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,409
hemoglobin change do not Club so sickle

70
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,170
cell almost a Saiga si leads to reduced

71
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,219
lifespan if you have sickle cell your

72
00:02:55,169 --> 00:03:00,149
red blood cells are going to look like

73
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:02,219
this you could see the forms long and

74
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,539
flexible chains this is how hemoglobin

75
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:06,509
should look and this can lead to

76
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:10,109
clogging of red blood cell blood vessels

77
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:11,669
here leading to all sorts of issues and

78
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,769
problems of not being able to exchange

79
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,639
blood efficiently versus if you have

80
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:16,739
normal blood

81
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,988
let me see everything these nice little

82
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,209
round of red blood cells can move it

83
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,159
very efficiently heterozygotes though

84
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,409
they produced enough hemoglobin to keep

85
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,079
the red blood cells healthy even though

86
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:29,969
there is still some sickle cell

87
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,400
heterozygotes have enough to basically

88
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:37,650
keep most of the red blood cells healthy

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,209
and a lot of individual to survive so

90
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,370
why is the defective is still around

91
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,949
then yes if you can survive with it it's

92
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,989
okay but if you have the homozygous for

93
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:47,458
sickle cell you end up dying why is this

94
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,730
allele still around wisent has been

95
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,739
selected again well it affects this

96
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:55,229
disease affects central Africa one in

97
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,870
500 Africans but is almost unknown in

98
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:59,939
other racial groups just draws the

99
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,890
question well why people who are

100
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,680
heterozygous for sickle cell allele have

101
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,729
less susceptibility to malaria this is

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,370
an example of what's called the

103
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,840
heterozygote advantage so that malaria

104
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,989
that I talked about that lives in the

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,640
red blood cells if you're a heterozygote

106
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,069
and have one of your alleles for

107
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,709
sickle-cell you're actually resistant to

108
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:22,108
malaria this stabilizing selection is

109
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,930
just acting on the sickle cell allele it

110
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:27,629
occurs because malaria resistant counter

111
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,180
balances the lethal anemia so

112
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:33,509
in green here we have the presence of

113
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,389
where malaria tends to be found and here

114
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:40,409
we have the frequency of the sickle cell

115
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:42,959
allele the darker Reds are where there's

116
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,450
a higher frequency up to 10 plus 2 12

117
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,680
and a half percent plus and the lighter

118
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,599
regions or whether it's less found

119
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,180
you'll notice if we kind of look at both

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,860
of these in comparison we see that where

121
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,920
the sickle cell allele is present is

122
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,960
also areas of the world that malaria is

123
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,050
also present this is referring to that

124
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,089
heterozygote advantage so in tropical

125
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,780
Africa where malaria is common the

126
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:08,609
almost I get down it normal if you're

127
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,949
almost a it for normal which is what

128
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,980
most people are you would die from

129
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:16,009
malaria if you're homozygous recessive

130
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,110
for sickle cell you would die from

131
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:21,539
sickle cell however if you're a carrier

132
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,879
or a heterozygote you're relatively free

133
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,590
of both you survive and reproduce more

134
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,980
and therefore more common in the

135
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:30,810
population so we need one of those

136
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,000
alleles to carry normal hemoglobin and

137
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,370
having the other one encoding for sickle

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,379
cell if you're where malaria is present

139
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,310
we actually become basically resistant

140
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:43,259
to it so if I sit this is in malaria

141
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,870
detected cells the lower oxygen levels

142
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,300
is lowered enough because it's Ikhwan

143
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,970
which kills the cell and destroys the

144
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,259
parasite so why is this heterozygote

145
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,780
carrier in damage

146
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,360
well it's causing the parasites breaking

147
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,369
the life cycle of the parasite so in

148
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,860
this case to be heterozygote isn't

149
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,090
advantage the downfall is we still need

150
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,160
that sickle cell gene to be in the

151
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:06,719
population and there's that chance you

152
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,540
could your offspring could come up with

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,000
the homozygous for sickle cell and up

154
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,020
dying before they able to reproduce

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,050
again most of the world's normal

156
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:18,029
hemoglobin but affected by malaria if

157
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,889
you're this heterozygote you're able to

158
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:22,109
have enough normal hemoglobin to survive

159
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,120
but you'd have a little bit of reduced

160
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,100
effect so that the sickle cell gene

161
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,170
would kill and break the life cycle of

162
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,270
the parasite just an interesting

163
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,310
phenomenon that shows that tied in with

164
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:34,740
hardy-weinberg that this is not follow

165
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:39,050
the expected allele change because of

166
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,050
the advantage of the heterozygote
