1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,000
on this tobacco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,919
going to go over this industrial hemp

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,719
cbd variety trial

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:11,199
presented by kansas state university and

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,960
this has a lot of great information

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,959
that i think growers need to be aware of

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,730
so i want to provide a summary here

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:25,039
on debaco university

9
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:27,599
[Music]

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,439
all right let's get into the 2019 kansas

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,558
state university industrial hemp

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,399
cbd variety trial now as always if

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,599
you're looking for more information here

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,679
is the

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,640
citation to go along with the research

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,640
here

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,759
and a link and on the first page i'm

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,399
going to provide with you the general

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,920
summary

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,759
kind of get out some of the main details

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,440
to help you understand what this study

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,519
actually shows

23
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,878
so first off they're looking at outdoor

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,879
and high tunnel

25
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,799
so both while both technically fall

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,960
under the category of outdoor production

27
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,280
these are different environments keep in

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,960
mind that outdoor grown is outside with

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,480
full exposure to the elements

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,400
and in the study plants were grown in

31
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,359
containers on weed fabric

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,960
to help fertilize fertilizer trials but

33
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,920
other than this it represents the

34
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,879
typical outdoor

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,680
field conditions those plants grown in a

36
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,118
high tunnel

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
this is a structure that looks like a

38
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,118
greenhouse and while it has plastic

39
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,798
coverings you kind of see here it lacks

40
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,879
additional equipment to modify the

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,920
environment such as an example that

42
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,839
would be heaters

43
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,519
but it does act as a little bit wave to

44
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,840
protect the plants and a little bit more

45
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,719
to kind of moderate the temperature

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,240
so outdoor interest and concerns with

47
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,239
outdoor hemp production

48
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,478
is of interest because of reduced

49
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,438
infrastructure cost compared to indoor

50
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,239
operations

51
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,919
concerns with outdoor production is

52
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,519
unintentional pollination of flowers

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,239
which will reduce the total cannabinoids

54
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,920
produced

55
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,000
by plants as they will divert their

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,840
energy to seed production

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,078
and pollen can easily travel as far as

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,759
three miles but again with increasing

59
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,039
distance the percentage

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,718
of successful pollination will diminish

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,360
while an outdoor environment provides

62
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,919
many plant necessities for reduced cost

63
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,359
production incidental pollination can

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,560
reduce the overall yield and that

65
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,680
was one concern by growers choosing

66
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,159
to grow in the outdoor environment

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,080
looking at the study objective here so

68
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,598
to the study objective was to

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,680
evaluate commercially available

70
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,679
varieties of cbd hemp

71
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,319
in south central kansas grown in

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
containers outdoors or inside of a high

73
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,280
tunnel

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,280
to test whether the covered high tunnel

75
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
could effectively reduce pollination of

76
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,598
the plants within it

77
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,759
again to try to maximize those yields

78
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,280
so what was studied here so let's look

79
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,079
at the plant material

80
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,640
that was utilized in the substrates as

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
well

82
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:48,719
on june 17 2019 clones from rooted

83
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,639
cuttings of each variety located here in

84
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,318
table one were potted in one gallon

85
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,318
plastic pots

86
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,079
into seven gallon plastic pots or into

87
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,359
seven gallon fiber bags

88
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
the pots and bags were filled with

89
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,080
soilless potting substrate

90
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,640
composed of pine bark made by happy grow

91
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
and half

92
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,158
inch of screened pine bark nuggets and a

93
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,559
one to one volume ratio

94
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,318
amended with two pounds per cubic yard

95
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,598
of dolomitic limestone

96
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,759
so this is great that this study

97
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,518
provides you this level of detail

98
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,359
to give you an idea of exactly the

99
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,959
conditions these plants are subject to

100
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,800
as far as the variety in the source you

101
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,800
can see it right here

102
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,319
some they might be familiar with so you

103
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,120
may not be familiar with these are all

104
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,798
generally

105
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,280
favoring the cannabinoid cbd

106
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,799
now the fertilizer treatments so two

107
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,479
fertilizer treatments were studied

108
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,239
each incorporated into the growing

109
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,000
substrate fertilizer rates were

110
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,640
determined to ensure an equal amount of

111
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
nitrogen

112
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,079
in both treatments so they didn't just

113
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,799
give everything the same they wanted to

114
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,400
make sure

115
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,319
there was an equal and consistent amount

116
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,599
of nitrogen across all treatments

117
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,399
fertilizer one was conventional

118
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,878
controlled release fertilizer at 14.5

119
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,879
pounds per cubic yard of osmocote plus

120
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,199
15 912. you can see an example of that

121
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,759
right here that included micronutrients

122
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,598
as well

123
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,280
so that's what the plus stands for

124
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,438
fertilizer two is an organic chicken

125
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,799
manure based fertilizer called turf mate

126
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,479
423 right here it's incorporated at 65

127
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,040
pounds per cubic yard

128
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,719
in a micronutrient fertilizer micromax

129
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,919
pictured right here was added to the

130
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,680
substrate at 1.5 pounds per cubic yard

131
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,120
to compensate for the lack of

132
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,358
micronutrients present

133
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,959
in that organic fertilizer again this is

134
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,039
the great thing about scientific trials

135
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,879
that it offers this kind of comparison

136
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,040
and tries to keep some things equal and

137
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,600
limit the variability

138
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,479
so the outdoor and high tunnel layout so

139
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,680
plants were placed

140
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,839
outdoors on a container production pad

141
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,519
or in an adjacent high tunnel

142
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,599
for the outdoor plants they were placed

143
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,758
on black ground cloth and fastened

144
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,040
to a trellis wire to prevent blowing

145
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,040
over in the wind

146
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,080
and the spacing plants were in rows six

147
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,319
feet apart with

148
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,680
four feet spacing in the row great for

149
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,439
growers looking at

150
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,360
what type of spacing they should use in

151
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,120
their layout for the high tunnel it was

152
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,960
20 feet by 99 feet

153
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,160
and the plants were placed on the same

154
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,638
black fabric

155
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,919
ground cloth on the soil surface as the

156
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,038
outdoor plant so that was kept

157
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,439
consistent

158
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,800
covering with clear polyethylene covered

159
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,360
at the top of the high tunnel with 30

160
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
percent

161
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,439
white shade cloth over that the side

162
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,280
walls and end walls were covered with

163
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,918
insect exclusion screen to prevent

164
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,519
insect

165
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,519
pollinators from easily entering the

166
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,198
high tunnel and for spacing the plants

167
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,519
are spaced on a four by four

168
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,080
uh grid pattern just as you can see here

169
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,399
as this is an image from the trial

170
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,240
now the pre-method irrigation and

171
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,478
general experimental design

172
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
for pruning method on june 21st each

173
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:34,719
terminal growing point was removed or

174
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,960
pinched

175
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
to encourage lateral branching the

176
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,918
plants had been

177
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,599
pinched twice previously while in the

178
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,918
one gallon plastic pots

179
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,919
for irrigation throughout july plants

180
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,359
were hand watered every other day

181
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,599
for the remainder of the season plants

182
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,680
were watered daily via micro irrigation

183
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,919
spray steak in each container

184
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,519
again help offers consistency the

185
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,799
experimental design was a randomized

186
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,359
complete block design with

187
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,759
split plot arrangement of treatment and

188
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
the whole plot was high tunnel

189
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,600
or outdoors while subplots were

190
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,479
container type and fertilizer form

191
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,919
data was analysized with anova and being

192
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,560
separated with fischer

193
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,478
protected lsd testing for those looking

194
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,478
at the stats

195
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,079
in season nitrogen deficiency was

196
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,120
noticed on this is kind of a picture

197
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,120
from the trial

198
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,038
by late july outdoor plants fertilized

199
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
with the organic fertilizer were smaller

200
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,879
and displayed symptoms of nitrogen

201
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,080
deficiency or chlorosis in figure 2 as

202
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,839
we can see right here

203
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,279
compared to plants on conventional

204
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,519
fertilizer

205
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,879
since this was kind of noticed in season

206
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,399
to prevent crop loss

207
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,719
outdoor and high tunnel plants with

208
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,079
organic fertilizer were top dressed with

209
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,520
conventional controlled release

210
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,758
fertilizer

211
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:48,318
heralds 176 12 plus at 120 grams per

212
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,759
container on july 29th prior to

213
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,520
fertilizer application chlorophyll

214
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,598
readings were taken on all plants

215
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,719
with a handheld chlorophyll meter or

216
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,680
spad meter

217
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,080
one one measurement was taken on each of

218
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,918
the three individual fully mature leaves

219
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,680
per plant an average to obtain

220
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,439
chlorophyll reading per plant

221
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,120
again great to know where those numbers

222
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,199
that you can look at

223
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,199
came from those great explanation in

224
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,160
their materials and methods

225
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,080
so influence of container type so there

226
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,000
was no influence of container type on

227
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:20,318
any of the gross data collected

228
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,759
data wasn't shown so data presented are

229
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,759
averaged across container type the

230
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,439
plastic pots and the fiber bags

231
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,000
so there's no difference so these kind

232
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,240
of merge them together

233
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,759
now the chlorophyll content readings as

234
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,639
they talked about earlier how they were

235
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,560
kind of

236
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,720
collected this is the actual data

237
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,720
generated in the fertilizer form

238
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,639
organic or conventional influenced all

239
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
variety chlorophyll content

240
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,400
plants growing with organic fertilizer

241
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,839
had lower chlorophyll concentrations

242
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,038
than plants fertilized with conventional

243
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,439
fertilizer

244
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,199
an interaction between fertilizer form

245
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,000
and exposure meaning high tunnel or

246
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,038
outdoors

247
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
was observed in varieties ac dc cherry

248
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:57,918
and

249
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,199
the wife in these three varieties there

250
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,038
was a decrease in chlorophyll

251
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,160
concentration between conventional and

252
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,399
organic fertilizer

253
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
however the difference was magnified

254
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,799
outdoors

255
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,960
compared to the high tunnel produced

256
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,319
plants the chlorophyll concentration of

257
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,318
plants fertilized with conventional

258
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,680
fertilizer in the high tunnel compared

259
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,039
to outdoor plants fertilized with

260
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
conventional fertilizer

261
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,800
were nearly identical if you want to

262
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,560
take a short pause of the video here and

263
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,680
look at this slide here this is the data

264
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,959
actually presented

265
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,120
looking at organic and conventional

266
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,198
fertilizers on the outdoors and in the

267
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,000
high tunnel situations

268
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,478
now looking at the plant height only ac

269
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,080
dc

270
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,240
and cherry height were affected by

271
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
fertilizer form and their response was

272
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,918
opposite which is kind of interesting

273
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,440
plant height of all varieties was highly

274
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,158
influenced by exposure meaning growing

275
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,159
environment

276
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,838
the high tunnel plants were much taller

277
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,759
than the outdoor plants

278
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,200
and that's this is likely due to the

279
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,519
less wind and reduced

280
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,560
photo inhibition that occurred in that

281
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,480
environment

282
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,079
for cbd hemp plant height is less

283
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,800
important than the amount of fluoride

284
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,120
material

285
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,399
so take a look at the next slide but you

286
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,320
can take a pause here and look at this

287
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,080
data presented

288
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,839
now the number of colas the primary

289
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
number of coils per plant was strongly

290
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,680
influenced by the

291
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,959
high tunnel environment in all varieties

292
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,599
both cherry and

293
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,399
super cbd were only influenced by the

294
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
high tunnel

295
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,919
whereas the other varieties were also

296
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,639
influenced by the fertilizer form

297
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,399
and an interaction was observed all

298
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,679
cherry plants in the outdoor plot

299
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,759
had completely senesced by the

300
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,719
experiment termination while the high

301
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,360
tunnel plants

302
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
were alive and appeared as expected at

303
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,320
harvest time

304
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,000
conventional fertilizer increased colon

305
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,680
number in ac dc

306
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,440
otto to stout and the wife there was a

307
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,278
great greater than 100 percent increase

308
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
in coal and number in the high tunnel

309
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,519
the wife plants with conventional

310
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,639
compared to organic fertilizer

311
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,320
68.6 compared to 32.6 respectively so

312
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,240
just an important note there

313
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,600
and we can see again the information

314
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,879
which is great about the scientific

315
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,920
studies if you're looking at comparing

316
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,200
these varieties

317
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,519
and not just looking at anecdotal

318
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,519
information here's some scientific

319
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,039
carried out studies now when we look at

320
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,639
fresh weight considering the differences

321
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,360
in plant height and number of primary

322
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,278
colas

323
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,879
it is not surprising that plants in the

324
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,078
high tunnel had greater fresh weight at

325
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,399
harvest time

326
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,359
so just taking that previous

327
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,759
observations

328
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,519
not surprising here in many instances

329
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,360
fresh weight was doubled in high tunnel

330
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,120
compared to outdoor plants

331
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,360
additionally the conventional fertilizer

332
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,399
also positively influenced the plant

333
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,839
fresh weight

334
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,360
in the combination of the protected

335
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,720
environment of the high tunnel that

336
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,039
produced taller plants

337
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,440
and the improved nutrient source that

338
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,679
created more highly branched plants

339
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,440
evident by the increased number of colas

340
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,159
result in overall increased plant

341
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
biomass

342
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,360
at harvest time again you can look at

343
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,199
the data here

344
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,959
presented generally in the same form but

345
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,680
in this case table 5 looking at

346
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,518
fresh weight now the cannabinoid

347
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,359
production for the outdoor plants

348
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,639
overall low cannabinoid production due

349
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,039
to not

350
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,319
unexpected do the fiber and dual purpose

351
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,159
variety trial

352
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,160
plot approximately 400 feet north of the

353
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,319
high tunnel and outdoor cbd

354
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,679
variety plot high rates of pollination

355
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,920
were anticipated

356
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,799
with those outdoor plants the wife had

357
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,319
the highest cbd content at 4.6 percent

358
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,639
this variety also appeared to have the

359
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,278
most well-developed female flower buds

360
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,000
in the lowest quantity of seeds which

361
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,078
would correlate

362
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
with the highest cbd content or

363
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,439
cannabinoid production

364
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
thc concentrations were all well below

365
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,680
the 0.3 threshold for industrial hemp

366
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,760
in all varieties so it's an important

367
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,799
note to make and we can see that again

368
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,078
presented on the data right here however

369
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,599
when we go to the high tunnel plants

370
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,359
this area right here

371
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,278
some seed development was observed but

372
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,320
much less in comparison

373
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:41,519
to the outdoor plants cbd concentration

374
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,160
reached as high as 9.9 percent and 10.5

375
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,039
percent in

376
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,759
the wife and cherry respectively this is

377
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,919
likely due to lower rate of pollination

378
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,000
thc was detected in most of the samples

379
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,039
and was below that 0.3 percent for

380
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
industrial hemp

381
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,039
however thc and acdc was reported to be

382
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,720
0.4 percent

383
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,599
so that could be a little note of kind

384
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,440
of concern there now for everything else

385
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,159
definitely below that 0.3 threshold

386
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,600
the researchers also made notes on pest

387
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,399
pressure so although data was not

388
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,560
collected

389
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,759
significant pests were noted throughout

390
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,838
the growing season

391
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,278
and this is important not only for this

392
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,120
trial if you're looking at growing

393
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,759
industrial hemp in general to be on a

394
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,159
lookout

395
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,879
for these particular pests for outdoor

396
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,078
plants

397
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,679
the pest pressure was straight with

398
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,559
spotted cucumber beetles as we can see

399
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,239
right here

400
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,399
early in the season damage was mostly

401
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,680
cosmetic and restricted primarily to

402
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,679
foliar feeding

403
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,199
eurasian hemp ore was noted on several

404
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,479
outdoor plants causing damage to the

405
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,399
flower buds

406
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,600
no control efforts were attempted for

407
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,759
this pest

408
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,440
now in the high tunnel armyworms were a

409
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,439
nuisance and primarily controlled by

410
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,720
scouting and removal by hand

411
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,320
and their presence did not appear to

412
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,278
have any significant impact on the

413
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,278
plants

414
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,799
russet mites were extensive on

415
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,639
individual plants during the

416
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,240
outbreak and heavily infested plants

417
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,079
were removed and replaced

418
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,159
and lightly infested plants were pruned

419
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,479
to remove infested branches

420
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,000
protective sprays two times weekly for

421
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,959
two weeks of pyrethrin

422
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,600
which is in the form of pyganic and um

423
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,119
as

424
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,680
as zentrith uh as azendra

425
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,679
tank mix seem to control the pest for

426
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,359
the remainder of the growing season

427
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,359
so again keep in mind to be on the

428
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,000
lookout for these particular pests

429
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,480
because they were shown

430
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,839
in this study to affect potentially the

431
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,200
plants

432
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,399
now study objectives revisited here well

433
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,639
evaluate commercially available

434
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,000
varieties of cbd hemp in south central

435
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,560
kansas grown in containers

436
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,679
outdoor outdoors or inside that of a

437
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,679
high tunnel

438
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,198
container did not impact plants to any

439
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,159
measurable degrees that's an important

440
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:41,519
note to make

441
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,078
that really matter what containers the

442
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,480
plants were grown in as far as varieties

443
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:46,159
go

444
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,759
the wife and cherry varieties produce

445
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,639
the greatest amount of cbd in both

446
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,958
outdoor

447
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,639
and high tunnel environments high tunnel

448
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,479
grown plants produce greater cbd

449
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,320
percentages than outdoor plants

450
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,920
due to reduced amount of pollination

451
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,680
which is an important note

452
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,599
to test whether a covered high tunnel

453
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,519
could effectively reduce pollination

454
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
of plants within while some seed

455
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,919
development was observed in the high

456
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,839
tunnel

457
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,679
there is much less pollination compared

458
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,040
to plants in an outdoor plot

459
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:12,799
that's a very important note to make

460
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,480
that maybe it is justifiable

461
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,719
to have that expense of the high tunnel

462
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,519
so lastly just a quick general summary

463
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,839
of the

464
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,759
of the data for outdoor organic

465
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,279
fertilizer should be used with caution

466
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,198
due to the potential for increased

467
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:30,720
nitrogen deficiency

468
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:32,479
in the hytel environment i'd recommend

469
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,079
if the chance for pollination exists in

470
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,680
a particular field

471
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,838
make sure to be using insect knitting on

472
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,838
the sidewalls you also want to scout for

473
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,519
russet mites and army worms

474
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,880
as they were a notable pest in this

475
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,039
study

476
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,958
for in general the wife and cherry

477
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,039
varieties should be considered if the

478
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,278
percent cbd is the main goal

479
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,480
while still keeping thc levels below

480
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,399
that 0.3

481
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,920
threshold using a high tunnel will

482
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,399
likely increase yields

483
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,439
the question to growers is can the cost

484
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,278
of the high tunnel

485
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,279
be justified by the difference presented

486
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:03,759
here so this is the important part about

487
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,000
this

488
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,919
study does give you some information and

489
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,159
now you have to take this information

490
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,078
and see how well it may apply to your

491
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,120
particular growing situation

492
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,120
best of luck
