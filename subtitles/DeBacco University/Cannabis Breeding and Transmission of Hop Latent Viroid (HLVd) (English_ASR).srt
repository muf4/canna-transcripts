00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,019
in this debacle University video we'll

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,759
look at cannabis breeding and the

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,758
transmission of hop latent thyroid

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,359
[Music]

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,980
okay so if you're looking at creating

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,480
new seeds and doing some breeding you

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,960
still need to be concerned about hop

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,060
latent viroid and particularly how the

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,800
cross is being made so in the

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,778
description there's a link to some

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,420
further research where I got some of

12
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,559
these slides images from but we're going

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,539
to dive into that at least provide a

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,460
brief overview so this is looking at

15
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,280
infected female plants have a higher

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,340
transmission of hopalate and viroid than

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,660
when the male plant is infected we could

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,420
see that here with experiment one

19
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:47,339
positive females negative females

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,899
positive females with a negative male

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,879
negative females with a positive male

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,439
fire was present in the seed coat and

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,899
inside the seed when the females were

24
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,698
positive thyroid present on the seed go

25
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,500
in inside the seeds when the male was

26
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,019
infected but we see the transmission

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,179
rate higher or greater percentage when

28
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,680
the females were infected still

29
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,959
crossover infection even when the male

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,200
pollen is basically transferred from one

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,599
um to another it can be as high as 43 in

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,579
seeds most of the containers found on

33
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,500
the outside of the seed it's important

34
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,859
we're kind of looking at this comparison

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,780
here and it shows the basics of the

36
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,539
design this is looking at some of the

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,159
results females or positive males were

38
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,600
negative and we could see a higher

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,340
fraction with hot plate and thyroid

40
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,500
compared to when the opposite was true

41
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,000
when the females were deemed to be clean

42
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,379
and the males were infected with high

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,739
plate and thyroid Stills transmission

44
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:41,759
but to a lower degree they Quantified

45
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:43,679
with 31 out of 71 or 43.7 percent varies

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,959
from mother to mother and ranges from 23

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,140
to 53 so it could be as low as 23 as

48
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:51,059
high as 53 on average 43. so this is

49
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,799
where testing is really important even

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,140
for breeders even if you're like oh it's

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,720
just a male plant set in the pollen it

52
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,040
can still transfer over to that next

53
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,379
generation

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,360
now there are limitations in the sense

55
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,739
that the hot plate and varied cannot

56
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,478
become part of the Genome of the

57
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,159
particular cultivar it is existing in

58
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,959
some exterior structure it's not

59
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,719
integrated it's part of the chromosomal

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,280
structure so that's a good thing that is

61
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,259
going to help us to be able to find a

62
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,459
way to hopefully stop this thyroid off

63
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:19,979
from spreading

64
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,900
so what can it do what can impact the

65
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:23,878
epigenetics or the expression of

66
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,099
genetics in the plant and this is

67
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,840
looking at this RNA based but it can go

68
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:29,878
through verse transcriptases go back to

69
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
DNA ultimately looking at coding for

70
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,239
different proteins and leading to gene

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,580
expression this is where you get those

72
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,459
different funky weird shaped leaves

73
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,700
those depressed internodal spacings

74
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:44,219
those yellow colorations to leaves this

75
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,859
is what hopolite enviroid can do

76
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:49,439
so where's happily United in the actual

77
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,239
um plant well the viral load or the

78
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,400
viroid load I should say is throughout

79
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,620
the entire plant but can be variable at

80
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,760
least initially multiple samples of the

81
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,980
entire plant should be taken when

82
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,539
submitting a sample for screening and

83
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,000
this is important to screen your mail

84
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,219
plants as well as your female plants for

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,780
those looking at doing breeding also if

86
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,359
the plant is very young we might want to

87
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,759
sample The Roots but if you're growing a

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,940
mother plant or a long time breeding

89
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,859
male plant it will quickly in about six

90
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,900
weeks spread throughout the entire plant

91
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,239
so again the key part with this is

92
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,340
screening testing and repeat testing to

93
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,860
ensure you know your plants are clean

94
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,140
and you're not having any part of the

95
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,000
reading process with that hoplate and

96
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,439
viride even if you're just using the

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,439
male plants for their pollen
