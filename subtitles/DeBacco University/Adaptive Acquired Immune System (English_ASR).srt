1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
so here we look at the adaptive or

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,240
sometimes called the acquired immune

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,580
system there's a very precise sequence

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,859
of steps that goes on and the key part

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,289
here is we need to have the immune

6
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:17,129
system remembering and recognizing and

7
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:19,108
acting in a very specific manner through

8
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:21,329
this process or branch of the immune

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,730
system if you remember the innate immune

10
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,129
system is the other one that you're born

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,859
with and can be thought of as the other

12
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:30,239
branch of human system so looking

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,789
specifically at the acquired immune

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,609
system we may have seen this image

15
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:37,979
before relating to a hormone binding and

16
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:39,509
having a response that occurs but a very

17
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,218
similar process that goes with the

18
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:43,530
acquired immune system or getting the

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,140
adaptive immune system the first part

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,340
would need to have a very specific

21
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,100
recognition of the foreign substances

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,739
then occurs to the proteins on the cell

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,189
surface this acts to immobilized

24
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:58,078
neutralize or destroy them then we want

25
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:01,409
to amplify the inflamed inflammatory

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,520
response and active a complement so

27
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:04,588
what's happening is once we have that

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,320
binding occurring we want to destroy

29
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:08,700
that specific foreign invader but we

30
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,059
want to activate a bunch of other

31
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,430
cellular responses to help increase the

32
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,700
body's response to this foreign invader

33
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,729
and this helps the entire body maintain

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,159
high health because once one becomes

35
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:24,900
infected the body's immune system is

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,140
alerted and then this can be spread

37
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,270
throughout so the acquired immune system

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,379
technically has three main components to

39
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:36,060
it the first one is an antigen specific

40
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,129
so here's our antigens

41
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,710
these antigens are a molecule that

42
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:44,429
provokes a specific immune response

43
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:46,919
which specific to an antibody so the

44
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,670
antigen is the specific molecule that is

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,859
initiating this immune response now in

46
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,868
acquired immune systems is a systemic

47
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,938
process which means it's not restricted

48
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:59,868
by any region in the body and this is an

49
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:02,339
example plant we talked about systemic

50
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:04,890
insecticides or systemic products that

51
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,530
can go through the plant same concept

52
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,538
applies to the human body not restricted

53
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,969
by any work and travel within the body

54
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,839
in the third component to the acquired

55
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:15,848
or adaptive immune system is

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,759
fact that has memory they become

57
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:21,488
educated cells that remained after the

58
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:25,539
invader is gone every members and is

59
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:27,969
able to recognize certain pathogens the

60
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:30,699
coordinate system the it's two separate

61
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:33,189
overlapping arms one or B cells and

62
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:35,560
they're called the humoral immunity for

63
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:37,628
body fluid and they're thought of i

64
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,640
intact invaders outside the cells I

65
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:40,268
think T cells which is called sailor

66
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,869
immunity

67
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:46,090
they attack infected cells so again two

68
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,549
different components both performing

69
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,310
under the same immune system but have

70
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:55,000
different in separate overlapping arms

71
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,739
there it is most complex and slows to

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,568
respond are acquired immune system

73
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,390
because it has to activate cells for

74
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:03,159
each new invader or antigen on first

75
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,708
exposure takes about ten days to reach

76
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,239
peak levels so this is a more of a

77
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,310
long-term effect it's not an immediate

78
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:13,539
there is a little bit of a delay in this

79
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,219
recognition process antigens is a macro

80
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:16,628
molecule that reacts with the component

81
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:19,030
of the immune system so here's an

82
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:20,620
example of an antigen the figure above

83
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,870
here shows the entire structure of an

84
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,759
antigen and the different structures

85
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,590
here projecting from the different

86
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,608
shapes and then they're over exaggerated

87
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:33,340
in this image represent potential

88
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,590
epitopes so a given antigen may contain

89
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,109
several motifs which are recognized by

90
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,120
immune cells in each motif has an

91
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:41,530
epitope so again a little over

92
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,659
exaggeration with different colors and

93
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,509
shapes but the key part as we learned

94
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:48,280
with proteins this shape is very

95
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:51,429
important for recognition and we're

96
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,039
seeing that also the that theme name

97
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,599
continued with the immune system so the

98
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,568
antigen binding say is different in T

99
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,129
and B cells so a t-cell receptor spans

100
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:01,958
the membrane and projects variable

101
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:04,659
binding regions into the actors belly

102
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:09,519
the cellular space binds the process

103
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:13,568
antigens via MHC major histone complex

104
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,579
here now our b-cells look very different

105
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:17,680
on just a quick comparisons from as a

106
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:20,168
branched appearance and this one has a

107
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,418
single appearance where b-cell receptors

108
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:24,310
are embedded in the membranes of the

109
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:27,359
b-cells and bind to their variety of

110
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,060
antigens through their variable regions

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,490
the signal transduction region transfers

112
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,319
the signal into the cell so you can see

113
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,810
this one goes completely through it has

114
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,210
an intercellular domain this one does

115
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,310
not this one does have the branched

116
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:43,799
variable regions and soon has a single

117
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,519
variable region they both have antigen

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,069
binding sites here and here but the T

119
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,068
cells only have one the B cells have to

120
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:54,990
think of B's having two bumps and he's

121
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:57,750
having one lime to help you remember

122
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:01,199
those these cells are catching the

123
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:04,439
Gators in body fluids so what they do is

124
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,580
they originate in the bone marrow so B

125
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,348
cells to help you remember the name you

126
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:09,930
can think of be standing for where they

127
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:12,509
mature is in bone marrow remember bone

128
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,060
marrow is producing our red white blood

129
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,788
cells and also our platelets interacting

130
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,918
with that lymphatic system so there's B

131
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:22,589
cells originating they mature in that

132
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,139
bone marrow so getting D cells you think

133
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:29,848
of bone marrow they circulate in the

134
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:31,918
blood in the lymph and the response for

135
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:34,649
catching invaders in the body so here's

136
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,049
our B cell we see through binding

137
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:39,810
receptors here with our helper T cells

138
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,430
go over in another lecture we're now

139
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,579
seeing we're producing memory b-cells

140
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:47,959
for the longer term and then plasma

141
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:50,278
cells here with antibodies strewn about

142
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,138
b-cells are important for recognition so

143
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:54,838
they want to see identification and this

144
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:58,379
is why the MHC is part of the receptor

145
00:05:54,838 --> 00:06:00,629
used for that so peripherally plasma

146
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,729
cells produce antibodies you see here

147
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:05,039
and our memory cells provide quick

148
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:06,990
response on re-exposure so while

149
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,288
initially might be in a slow process

150
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,449
Patri exposure is where that quicker

151
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:14,098
response is occurring in the memory

152
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,079
cells so they're holding on for the long

153
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:17,550
term

154
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,038
lastly our t-cells are destroying a

155
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,759
decklid cells and they are present in

156
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:25,620
mature in the thalamus here so a way to

157
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,028
help you remember that the original

158
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,598
marrow but they mature in the thalamus

159
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:32,189
so T cells thalamus T and T event they

160
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,128
develop the ability to identify foreign

161
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:39,509
agents by antigens presented on the cell

162
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:41,220
surface so we see our antigen presenting

163
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,800
complex here we

164
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,000
our recognition site you have our

165
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,710
t-cells being involved in destroying

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,899
infected cells which are very important

167
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,930
to the proper functioning of the immune

168
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,929
system
