1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,639
so here we're gonna look at the absolute

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:08,068
evolutionary path to apes so I've had

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,109
some students that look like this kind

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,550
of when I'm given lectures and then when

5
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:13,379
they realize all the slides where I say

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,480
there's a test tomorrow typically

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,219
students may kind of switch and it looks

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,899
like this we're going to talk about

9
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,349
these two particular types of monkeys

10
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:24,239
and what makes him each unique so

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,160
starting with the evolutionary path so

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,879
storage humans of evolution begins

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,668
around 65 million years ago with the are

14
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:35,659
canta it's a small group of a burl

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,789
animals that were primarily insectivores

16
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:41,849
fed on insects they underwent an

17
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:44,100
explosive radiation that gave them rise

18
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,039
to different types of mammals including

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,989
bats and primates now I say radiation

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,329
we're not talking about like nuclear

21
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:53,549
waste radiation talk about radiation in

22
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,590
the sense of how they're organized in a

23
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:58,140
cloud ram so this radiation there's a

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,120
lot of branching that's occurring a lot

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,878
of diversification is a way to think

26
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,469
about it so the earliest primates have

27
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:09,179
two distinctive features that allow them

28
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:11,579
to succeed in this a burl insect eating

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,400
environment grasping fingers and toes in

30
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,048
overlapping binocular vision so you can

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,719
see here evidence of our grasping

32
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,150
fingers and toes to climb limbs hang

33
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,819
from branches and use tools the overlap

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,740
in binocular vision using two eyes let's

35
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,750
the brain judge the distance precisely

36
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:30,449
so our binocular vision when our eyes

37
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,269
overlap we're able to determine how far

38
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,850
an object may be close or away from us

39
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:38,009
so if you know anyone who has damaged to

40
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,839
one of their eyes they may be restricted

41
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,899
from playing certain sports because of

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,478
their lack of depth of perception about

43
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,670
40 million years ago and why a stands

44
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,728
for a million years ago the earliest

45
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,430
primates split into two groups and we

46
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:56,519
have this kind of before monkeys group

47
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,509
that we kind of allocate here and it's a

48
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,188
smaller group

49
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,728
they're probably nocturnal and

50
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:06,959
herbivores only a few survived today so

51
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:08,939
they're very ancient and as a result the

52
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,400
monkeys that now have kind of developed

53
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,469
in hominids have F replaced or reduced

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,590
the amount of

55
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,060
these particular monkeys that are around

56
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,509
so higher primates include monkeys apes

57
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,400
and humans these are diurnal and

58
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:25,709
herbivores so remember die Arnold's

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,230
referring to organisms that are awake

60
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:31,620
during the day compared to our nocturnal

61
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:34,069
are organisms that mainly function at

62
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,349
night they also involved bigger brains

63
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:40,049
improved senses and adapted for daytime

64
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,060
foraging live in groups with complex

65
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,890
social interactions and tend to care for

66
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,250
the young for prolonged periods of time

67
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:50,579
these are all examples of this

68
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,740
particular type of monkey the diurnal

69
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,959
versus the predecessors which was mostly

70
00:02:52,740 --> 00:03:00,510
nocturnal early anthropods are now

71
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:04,530
extinct anthropoids sorry but now

72
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:06,989
extinct and they evolved in Africa their

73
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,539
direct descendants our old world can

74
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,640
also new world monkeys so I've heard of

75
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,979
old world monkeys these are ones that

76
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,319
kind of stayed in Africa but they have

77
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:19,069
two lineages the old world in the

78
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,799
hominids and mainly ground dwellers

79
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:24,389
don't have a prehensile tail the new

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,580
world monkeys ourselves you see here in

81
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,799
South America and Central America they

82
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,910
it's where they migrated to they

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,700
developed in isolation and are at a burl

84
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:38,340
they also have that prehensile tails

85
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,229
this is an example what Anu I'm sorry an

86
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,900
old old monkey would look like this is

87
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:44,729
just an example of a new world monkey

88
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,030
now when comparing our Apes to hominids

89
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:49,590
Ayanna's evolved from these and apes in

90
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,650
hominids and humans are the direct

91
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,870
descendants or in the direct ancestors

92
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,879
so directly descended from these

93
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,159
hominids children's these are the

94
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,310
closest living human relatives because

95
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:05,060
they share about 98.4% of their nuclear

96
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:09,030
DNA gorillas and humans to share about

97
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,469
97.7% but that in perspective what

98
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,900
percentage of your genes do you share

99
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:16,488
with other organisms well it's about 98%

100
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:20,910
with the chimpanzees 92% of the mouse

101
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:24,029
leaving up 44% with the fruit fly 26%

102
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,229
with yeast and 18% with the plant so you

103
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,709
can see there is still a fair amount of

104
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:26,909
overlap

105
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,329
even though

106
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,230
it might be very different compared to

107
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:34,079
organisms that might even be in

108
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,600
different kingdoms comparing Apes to

109
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,639
hominids you see our similar structures

110
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,379
in the same colors here there's also

111
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,810
some distinct big differences

112
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,069
so the femur in this case is angled out

113
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,379
here our fumer signal in our pelvis is

114
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:51,599
for us is bull shaped for the chimpanzee

115
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,310
it's long and narrow and you can see

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,950
again some of the comparisons that are

117
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,829
derived here the common ancestor for

118
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:02,639
both beeps and hominids sought to have

119
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:05,579
been in a burl climber comments became

120
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,319
bipedal which means walking upright by

121
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:09,959
meaning to pedal mean walking walking

122
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,339
upright with two legs hips evolved

123
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,289
knuckle walking and that's what you kind

124
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,599
of see here they're kind of hunched over

125
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,580
appearance there's an technical

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,120
differences between the two are related

127
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:23,789
to a by local motion so when you're

128
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,620
walking upright certain things are going

129
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,939
to kind of shift in shape to make it

130
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,500
more efficient and if you're what's

131
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,410
called a knuckle Walker kind of hunched

132
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,449
over a lot

133
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,250
so the concept of bipedalism seems to

134
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,500
evolved as our ancestors left dense

135
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,329
forests progressives and open woodlands

136
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,339
so if you're in the most of trees

137
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:44,490
there's a lot of overgrowth this kind of

138
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:46,250
knuckle walking hunched over way of

139
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,389
getting around might be advantageous

140
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,939
however when you go to the open field

141
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,729
here how bright and bipedalism is

142
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:57,689
definitely favored questions did pie

143
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:59,240
bipedalism proceed or succeed brain

144
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:01,529
enlargement you know which came first

145
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,400
fossils on earth in Africa demonstrate

146
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,219
that bipedalism

147
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,889
exceeded extended back four million

148
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,540
years ago substantial brain expansion on

149
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,000
the other hand did not appear until two

150
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,879
million years ago so this evidence

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,709
suggests that bipedalism occurred before

152
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:18,959
brain expansion as I mentioned

153
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,479
bipedalism if you've seen videos online

154
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,909
maybe of dogs walking with purses here

155
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,490
upright this is not an example of true

156
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,990
bipedalism this is simply an animal

157
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,168
that's kind of learned to kind of walk

158
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,300
upright the true bipedalism here we see

159
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:36,120
the change in structural features

160
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,400
causing it to be more efficient for that

161
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,209
particular organism to walk in this

162
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,209
upright fashion
