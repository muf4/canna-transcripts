1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,399
here we're gonna be applying the

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:08,039
transgenic concept or genetic

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,980
engineering to plants many of the same

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,549
ideas and concepts apply the animals as

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,870
well

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,610
plants tend to be a little bit more

7
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:16,858
simpler in their organization so it's a

8
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:19,679
little bit easier to understand see here

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,320
with corn plants being grown this corn

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,778
seed is a transgenic plant is a GMO

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,899
genetically modified organism it says on

12
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:30,750
the bag here herbicide resistance so

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,939
that is a gene that's been inserted into

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,519
this particular corn seed to allow the

15
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:38,519
farmer to apply a particular herbicide

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,790
and to kill the weeds but not the host

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,440
plant here so it's looking general here

18
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,628
transgenic plants genes from one

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,390
organism being transferred to a plant

20
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:51,329
since DNA is nearly universal this is

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:56,100
possible because DNA regardless if it's

22
00:00:51,329 --> 00:01:00,259
a human a jellyfish corn plant a palm

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,719
tree all contained the universal code

24
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:06,329
allowing us to transfer and change

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,129
transgenic to move genes from plants to

26
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:12,478
animals or from one plant to another

27
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:13,978
plant so we come at DNA plant cells read

28
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,228
the DNA sequence and just like it was in

29
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:18,900
normal sequence so just reading along

30
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:20,670
and hey there's adenine G it's quaniee

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,920
and so on and so forth they're just

32
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,680
reading it right along so when we read

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,810
common DNA or we insert genes you could

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,810
see here our eco r1 site a restriction

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,549
enzyme and we insert a gene of interest

36
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,650
it just goes along and reads that

37
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,180
plasmid just as normal this would be

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,728
there's anything different or foreign

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,810
because it's the same universal code

40
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:44,519
regard across all organisms so how to

41
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,228
make a transgenic plant kinda simple and

42
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,989
easy steps here and step one find a gene

43
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:51,149
of interest in an organism and example

44
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,819
would be an insect resistance bacterium

45
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,460
so here's our enzymes our BT Bacillus

46
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,589
thuringiensis is a very common one

47
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:01,649
that's obtained inserted into corn

48
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,689
expression and here's our promoter

49
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,640
region here's our plasmid we're putting

50
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:08,219
those foreign genes into the corn cell

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,318
genome and the grow GM corn chip a

52
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,568
modified corn so the key part here is to

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,949
find a transgenic plant we want to make

54
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:15,628
it worth our while

55
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:19,768
find a gene that's of interest for

56
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:22,530
mannerism I don't think you realize how

57
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:24,390
difficult this initial step is it sounds

58
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,519
really easy but finding that gene of

59
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:29,009
interest is like finding a needle in a

60
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,349
haystack it's hard to identify and

61
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:33,419
isolate the correct gene or the specific

62
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:34,949
unit you're interested in here is a

63
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,549
human chromosomes of chromosome 9

64
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:41,030
contains 136 million base pairs and

65
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,950
that's just one of the chromosome

66
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,568
chromosomes that we have so identifying

67
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:47,609
exactly the location and where that

68
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:50,039
dream is and splicing that gene out is a

69
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,200
very difficult and time-consuming and

70
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,509
kind of expensive process but it is

71
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,009
possible again just because it's

72
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,899
possible I think it's really easy to go

73
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,000
through and it's polar gene now does

74
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,719
take quite a bit of research to be able

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,829
to identify that and where it's located

76
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,568
kind of make a transgenic plant and

77
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,670
alternate route to this instead of

78
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:10,619
trying to find the gene often we want

79
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:12,238
that gene to make a protein so if

80
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,039
there's a certain protein product that's

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,039
the goal may be possible to work

82
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,090
backwards in the genetic sequence begin

83
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,849
with the end in mind

84
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,129
so through reverse transcriptase it's an

85
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,799
enzyme that generates DNA from RNA we

86
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:27,900
can work backwards so you could see here

87
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,480
we have our protein so taking our

88
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,049
protein and working our way backwards we

89
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,629
can generate RNA and from RNA we can

90
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:39,569
work backwards and generate DNA so this

91
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:41,840
can be one way because our concern here

92
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:45,719
is the end protein we don't necessarily

93
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,430
care about this exact DNA sequence we

94
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,250
can get a DNA sequence that will match

95
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,040
that particular protein remember back

96
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,409
from our translation and transcription

97
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:58,289
there's different DNA sequences remember

98
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:00,568
codons for amino acids so there was a

99
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:03,179
potential for many different DNA

100
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:06,179
sequences to generate the same protein

101
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,819
but there will be very specific lengths

102
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,669
and needs and organisation of those

103
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:14,098
nucleotides to donate that specific

104
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:18,150
protein that we want to produce with our

105
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:20,870
transgenic plant so complementary DNA

106
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,519
information which is lowercase cDNA

107
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,340
primary RNA transcript contains exons

108
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,389
and introns the process of mRNA contains

109
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,679
only exon

110
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,930
hopefully remember that for our previous

111
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,658
lecture it's used as the template to

112
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,990
create a single strand of DNA termed

113
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:39,089
complementary DNA this cDNA is converted

114
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,340
to a double-stranded molecule we're kind

115
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:45,028
of trying to work our way backwards here

116
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:46,859
from our end protein region so reverse

117
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:49,918
transcriptase an enzyme used to generate

118
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,270
complimentary DNA from an RNA template

119
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,889
remember it's kind of going backwards

120
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:55,378
that's why it's called reverse

121
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:58,348
transcription it's mainly associated

122
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,330
with retroviruses as we learned back

123
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:02,839
when we did DNA and RNA and talked a

124
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:07,228
little bit about viruses viruses can be

125
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:09,299
DNA based or RNA based if their RNA

126
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:11,300
based they want to go back in through

127
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,129
inverse transcriptase nodes are called

128
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:17,668
retroviruses not Maris's from the 70s

129
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:21,028
but viruses that are made or have the

130
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:22,859
main sequencing RNA that need to go to

131
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:24,750
the process of reverse transcription to

132
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,139
journey that DNA to redirect the cell

133
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,610
that's trying to infect Panama code

134
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,769
transgenic plant we developed a cloning

135
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,150
vector plasmids in which small segments

136
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:35,158
of DNA is produced independently from

137
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,138
the main chromosome little circular

138
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:40,348
plasmids remember from our procare's or

139
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,810
bacterial cell we have that effector

140
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:44,699
that we're looking at having our gene of

141
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,750
interest inserted in and that's what we

142
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,778
want to replicate and they replicate

143
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,490
very quickly as I said e.coli can

144
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:55,168
multiply itself every 20 minutes these

145
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:58,348
plasmids can replicate very fast step 3

146
00:05:55,168 --> 00:06:00,359
is to cut the main DNA and vector with

147
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:02,399
the same restriction enzyme so the

148
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,370
sticky ends can join who have the Hindy

149
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,439
3 gene we're cutting our main genome as

150
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,120
well our gene of interest so they can

151
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,699
bind together this will incorporate the

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,949
vector into the main sequence of DNA be

153
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,139
able to replicate that those sticky ends

154
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:17,158
are areas that want to join together and

155
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,098
they're cut with the same restriction

156
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:22,918
enzyme so it's the same ends and this as

157
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:24,810
a result we can cut this original plat

158
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,758
host plasmid put our little gene of

159
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,918
interest in there and seal it back up

160
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,759
the cells just going to read it as

161
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:35,908
normal it's a hair original strand

162
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,009
strand one in strand to our circular DNA

163
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:41,009
once incorporated the key now is

164
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:42,900
replication of that sequence we want

165
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,480
cells to multiply as quickly as possible

166
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:48,359
we want those plasmids to go through and

167
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,250
make to and exponentially multiply from

168
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,189
there what's going on here we see our

169
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,660
plasmids and replication is occurring we

170
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:59,839
could also integrate our plasmid into

171
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,840
our host DNA sequence and multiply that

172
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,129
step five here we're taking our gene of

173
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:07,889
interest in making it into T DNA or

174
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:10,500
transfer DNA this sequence and inserting

175
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,149
into independent clamps chromosomes this

176
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,259
does occur in natural is I don't want

177
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:15,589
you to think this is a completely

178
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,089
foreign process in agro bacterium

179
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:19,769
they're gram-negative bacterium used

180
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:22,529
horizontal gene transfer to cause tumors

181
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:24,120
or galls and plants typically if you

182
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,979
walk in the woods you might see up a

183
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,170
tree that looks that has these goals

184
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,910
these weird growth on them that's

185
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,069
because they've been infected with agro

186
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,640
bacterium this is what kind of look will

187
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:37,079
look like it can also occur on roots so

188
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,459
it's a type of bacterium called agro

189
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,729
bacterium that causes plant diseases

190
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:43,529
such as crown gall and hairy root that

191
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,020
results in plant death and agricultural

192
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:49,679
loss because this kind of massive cells

193
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:52,139
kind of resembles to you could say to

194
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,750
some extend some similares could be

195
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,949
drawn to like a cancer in every

196
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,769
bacterium the ability to infect the

197
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,569
plant is contained within a gene the

198
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,789
plasmid that's transferred from one

199
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:06,329
bacteria to another through a process of

200
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,670
this conjugation in this gall that forms

201
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:10,740
it's reducing this surface area to

202
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,480
volume ratio in this case in the roots

203
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,930
not allowing these roots to be as

204
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,819
efficiently absorbed nutrients go

205
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,170
through the major details all this but

206
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,719
this does provide some background

207
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,879
information and this is a plant cell

208
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,890
this is our agro bacterium and this

209
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,860
bacterium it's very unique about it it

210
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:32,580
is able to take its genes or certain

211
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,039
genes from its own plasmid and insert it

212
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,139
into a host cell it has ways of

213
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,360
bypassing a lot of the regulatory

214
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:42,000
mechanisms that in this case this plant

215
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,330
cell has so it's this transfection

216
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,669
by agro bacterium well we've done

217
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:51,480
through a process of biotechnology is

218
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:53,429
replicating this same basic idea or in

219
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,899
some cases having the agro bacterium

220
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:57,229
take that gene of interest

221
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,879
the agrobacterium be the one inserts it

222
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,310
here's again a quick plant genetic

223
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,870
modification summary it mirrors a lot of

224
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:06,299
the general genetic biotech that we

225
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,129
talked about taking our plasmid our

226
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:10,439
foreign DNA cutting with aa restriction

227
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:12,899
enzymes with our sticky ends joining it

228
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,670
here mass multiplying it in this case

229
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,620
taking our original cells using our go

230
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:19,769
back term to insert the gene of interest

231
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,750
having the way to screen select for the

232
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:23,730
cells that have our gene of interest and

233
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,190
then growing a plant from that that will

234
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,879
then produce the particular protein that

235
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,880
were interested in
