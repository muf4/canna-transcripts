in this debaco university student series

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,240
video we're going to go over how to set

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,480
up a digital timer for your growing

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,080
operation so if you're a little confused

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,679
exactly what all those buttons do

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,000
hopefully this will provide you with the

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,399
explanation so you can utilize it to its

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,399
greatest effectiveness

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,560
hi today we're going to be showing you

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,560
how to set up a digital timer so that

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,479
you could automate your grow by using

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,439
this timer to time your pumps or your

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,119
lights

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,039
so this is what you will see when you

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,119
open up your digital timer it's a little

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,359
different from the mechanical timer as

18
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,839
you can see we have a few more buttons

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,920
we have the ability to adjust the day of

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,960
the week the hour the minute and even

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,120
the second this is our reset button

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,160
to set the time you hold down this clock

23
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,919
button and hit hour well first i'd want

24
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,479
to change the day of the week to reflect

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,559
that it is thursday so i'd hit clock and

26
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,959
week until it hits thursday

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,718
then while still holding clock i would

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,320
change the hour

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,320
to 4 pm

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,438
still holding clock i'm going to change

31
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,599
the minutes

32
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,599
over to

33
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,599
4.

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,920
20 pm

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
now to set when we want our

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,478
our

37
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,879
lights to come on and off we're going to

38
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,118
hit program the first one is when we

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,239
want our lights to turn on

40
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:31,920
so

41
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,519
like how we were setting up our clock

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,519
we're gonna hit the hour button

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,880
i want mine to turn on at midnight

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,399
so again just those same buttons for the

45
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,399
hour and minute to adjust

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
and then to set for when you want

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,479
the lights to turn off you hit program

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,478
again

49
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:03,199
and do the same thing i want to set it

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:07,240
for 6 pm the lights turn off if you hold

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,240
down it'll make it go faster

52
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,759
now once you're done setting the on and

53
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,159
off time you can hit clock again you

54
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,159
want to make sure that it says auto on

55
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,560
the bottom down here

56
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,400
since that's the only way this timer

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,120
will automatically turn your lights on

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,560
and off you have the option

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,000
for on which keeps them on constantly

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,400
or off which turns them off constantly

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,598
you want auto so that it reflects the

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599
timing that you just set

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
once you're done programming your

64
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,759
schedule you're going to want to make

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,360
sure

66
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,759
that the timer says auto on it that will

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,680
make sure that it'll perform to the

68
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,359
hours that you set it to

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,120
you could also

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,519
turn it on so that it is on constantly

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,519
or off so that the lights are off

72
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,519
constantly

73
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,399
you
