1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,099
see here we look at different types of

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:07,318
microscopes there's a couple general

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:08,939
categories that they all fit into and

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:11,218
we're going to investigate some of them

5
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,109
in class we mainly work with one type

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,209
but there are different ones for

7
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:17,160
different purposes like people have

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,618
different jobs there's different ones

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,539
for different substances a scientist may

10
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:22,829
want to look at students where you think

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,618
they need a microscope to look at their

12
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,479
small tiny grades but in this case we're

13
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,839
gonna be looking mainly at cells and

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,520
different sizes so starting with the

15
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,350
first one the compound lights is the one

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,050
you're probably most familiar with looks

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,460
very similar to this in many cases there

18
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:41,159
might be some variations depending on

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,128
the manufacturer looking at compound

20
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:46,909
light so there's a light source at the

21
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:49,109
bottom there's these IQ their lenses

22
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:51,448
here it's basically using a

23
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:54,509
magnification with the light these are

24
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:55,890
focused glass lenses and the image is

25
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,500
really being formed in the back of your

26
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,590
eye as you look through and it's

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,878
basically we use Elven images about 500

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,019
times better than what the human eye can

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,539
see if you were just to look at

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,969
something in general there all the parts

31
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,770
are labeled here to here the ocular lens

32
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,048
in particular or the eyepieces of

33
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:14,368
located up here these are the objective

34
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,850
lenses

35
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:19,200
down here and those gave different

36
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:21,259
magnifications when you're looking at

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,540
magnification you're actually taking

38
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,799
images or looking at pictures you want

39
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,680
to be sure you're taking into account

40
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,770
the objective lens and also any

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,900
magnification that the ocular lens may

42
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:38,459
add to that sometimes it's a factor of

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,380
10 so if this was times 100 you'd be x

44
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:45,389
my additional 10 I'd be actually a

45
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:47,609
thousand times more strong and objective

46
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,769
lenses you have to fine focus you have

47
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,239
the course focus the light source to die

48
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,129
for him to allow more or less light

49
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,048
through so you having trouble finding

50
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:57,030
the slide something on a slide that

51
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,310
looks like it's on there oh you always

52
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,228
want to start at low power and you want

53
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,820
to adjust the light if you put too much

54
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:04,468
light it may shine right through and

55
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:08,310
basically make it possible to see the

56
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:10,019
specimen these are some images taken

57
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,780
with a compound light microscope

58
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,710
these are cheek cells chloroplasts eat

59
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,229
muscle cells here

60
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,510
are really nice to find and here looking

61
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,069
at different cell stages and these are

62
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:23,069
all taken with a compound light

63
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:25,169
microscope should be familiar with what

64
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:28,530
microscope images that they produce

65
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:29,639
I'm sorry able to identify that okay

66
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,780
getting a little bit more unique

67
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,479
something you may not be familiar with

68
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,689
the transmission electron microscope the

69
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:39,509
TEM this is allows electrons to pass

70
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,819
through this specimen this is max

71
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:43,349
mastication is very strong about a

72
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,859
hundred thousand times better than the

73
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:49,289
human eye very complex very expensive

74
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,210
piece of equipment here and what it's

75
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:53,549
good reason why it has an electron gun

76
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,280
essentially it's a passing this electron

77
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,380
through the specimen how those images

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,509
look ins typically for very small items

79
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,579
such as viruses that the polio virus

80
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:04,189
looks like taken through a TEM or

81
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,380
transmission electron microscope

82
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:08,550
smallpox tissue section and it's

83
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,439
bacillus bacterium

84
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,930
all taken with transmission electron

85
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,050
microscopes another type is called

86
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,969
scanning electron s a.m. this is where

87
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,980
the specimens code with a very thin coat

88
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:21,930
of metal the electron beam is passed

89
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,359
across the specimen it's like a slit

90
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,730
like a scan that occurs anybody copier

91
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,250
machine and it's viewed on a large

92
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,810
screen TV screen again you don't have to

93
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,240
know the complexities of everything here

94
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,219
but again I'm using electrons the key

95
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,500
part here is it's coated with a thin

96
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,659
metal there's one what transmission went

97
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,509
through this is just a scanning of the

98
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,669
actual surface as a result we get some

99
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:47,370
very detailed very unique images the

100
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,739
pollen grains look like this is the

101
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,909
adhesive on a post-it note let's see if

102
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,010
I always think it's like kind of sticky

103
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:57,990
and flat this is it actually looks very

104
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:59,340
zoomed in now because we're scanning and

105
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,469
we're getting bounced back from the

106
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,659
electrons typically images come back as

107
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:06,090
black and white however through modern

108
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:08,669
days tools were able to colorize some of

109
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,830
those images to give them a bit more of

110
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,169
a vivid appeal make it easier to spot

111
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,520
certain things for example here the

112
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,108
yellow structures

113
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,430
almost look a little blended in you

114
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:19,139
might not even notice that they're there

115
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,650
and this black and white image here

116
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,579
they're very vibrant very easy to tell

117
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:26,149
this is a little bit more complicated

118
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:27,509
the immunofluorescence light microscope

119
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:29,699
what this

120
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,069
uses and this is an example of it it's

121
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,769
using antibodies developed against a

122
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,360
specific protein and have a special dye

123
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:39,509
attached to them

124
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,000
what's happening is the antibodies are

125
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:43,980
binding to something in particular with

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,079
this fluorescent dye allowing it to be

127
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,390
illuminated with an ultraviolet or a

128
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:51,050
blacklight light source and this allows

129
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:54,539
mapping indicate in the distribution of

130
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,650
specific proteins within a cell so how

131
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,270
does this look this might be a little

132
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:59,219
confusing a little bit different than

133
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:01,169
what you're used to so I think this is a

134
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,780
great summary and these are both kind of

135
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,520
showing very similar the same thing we

136
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,159
have our antigen and we're trying to

137
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,569
identify this little green circle here

138
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,439
so in the first case here with a primary

139
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:15,389
antibody with the tag on it well

140
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,370
basically we were putting this antibody

141
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,079
in solution we're bouncing around it's

142
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,680
fighting this one little green circle

143
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,259
and it's binding specifically only to

144
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,900
that green circle that boots bound that

145
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:31,550
only that green circle that is the only

146
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:34,739
spot this actual floor for this

147
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,470
basically light meaning or substance

148
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,870
will be attached now this allows us to

149
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,520
identify this the secondary

150
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,319
immunofluorescence is kind of very

151
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,319
similar to the first one where we're

152
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,550
still identifying the green circle here

153
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,680
however we're first using a primary

154
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,090
antibody to bind that that and then

155
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,430
we're using our secondary antibody

156
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:56,069
actually is labeled or tagged to bind to

157
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,470
that antibody so what this allows for is

158
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:02,969
you can see here multiple bindings here

159
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:05,790
one one green circle one antibodies

160
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,190
finding my Bruce a weaker signal here

161
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,189
we're allowed our secondary antibody

162
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:15,300
combined multiple times to that original

163
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:16,199
or that single primary antibody because

164
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,240
of that we're able to get maybe a

165
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,860
stronger signal so both of these are

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,910
accomplishing the same thing we're

167
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,720
identifying a very specific component of

168
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,700
the cell so this shows a good example

169
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,200
antibodies are extremely specific as a

170
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,420
result we can label them to look at

171
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,149
different things so this first image

172
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,120
we're defining this particular DNA and

173
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:41,370
that's blue here wheezing from green to

174
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,259
enough eye a different structure

175
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,870
and here using red to divide another

176
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,180
structure so when we just add that

177
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,300
single antibody we just get the blue we

178
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,340
just get the green we just get the red

179
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,439
if we combine all those antibodies were

180
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,959
able to now see a better picture of the

181
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,478
cell of where specifically different

182
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,039
components might be located and that's

183
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,740
the power of the immunofluorescence

184
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,169
light microscope image is that we're

185
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,960
able to determine or hash out where

186
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:12,029
different things might be located based

187
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,538
on their color because we're using

188
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:17,399
specific antibodies to bind to specific

189
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:20,269
antigens or specific proteins in certain

190
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:23,159
cases so um

191
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:24,839
fair questions on quizzes or tests might

192
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,600
be showing an image and you have to

193
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,099
identify what microscope was used so if

194
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,710
you're playing along in our home game I

195
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,840
have a series of images and the last

196
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:35,759
site will have the answer so I'm simply

197
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,189
not going to go through and answer the

198
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,959
ends of the questions you can play along

199
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:46,620
and say what microscope made this image

200
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:48,060
this is image one what image two looking

201
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,978
at the microscopes that we learned ahead

202
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:56,098
of time what image looking at this what

203
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:59,159
microscope may have made this image for

204
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:02,250
this continuing number three again what

205
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:06,960
microscope was used here and the last

206
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:08,759
one before again don't let the colors

207
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,399
fool you as we learned before so I'm

208
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,949
going to colorize an apical eyes look

209
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,589
actually I added two more so another

210
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:20,220
prime example into the microscopes maybe

211
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:24,209
used more than once and this is our last

212
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,380
one here won't microscopy this image so

213
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,509
for those looking for the answers played

214
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,219
along in our home game here's our six

215
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:31,228
answers to the six different images

216
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,320
you'll notice the compound light

217
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:36,028
microscope was not used in any of these

218
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,550
you're probably very familiar with that

219
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:39,958
one so I included these but please

220
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,968
realize that the compound light

221
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,799
microscope image is fair game for tests

222
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,800
or quizzes hope this was helpful
