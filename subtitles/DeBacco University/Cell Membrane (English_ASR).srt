1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,389
here we're gonna look at cell membranes

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,119
so this is an example of one a lot of

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:11,489
going on here keep in mind the cytoplasm

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,678
is on the inside of the cell and the

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,560
extracellular fluid is on the outside

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,300
this is the membrane that's dividing the

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,179
two and you can see there's a lot going

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,130
on here was our phospholipid bilayer and

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,989
our protein channels we're learning

10
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:28,799
about a little bit and hopefully explain

11
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:30,320
what some of these are so starting with

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,820
what we're focusing on that membrane

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,549
it's the area located right here you

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,640
could see these large bluish purple kind

15
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:40,349
of ovals represent proteins so now we're

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,600
just focused on this perimeter of the

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,390
cell we've gone over cell organelles all

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,390
these wonderful things on the inside now

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,659
we're focusing just on the perimeter

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:53,429
so first the overcoming the cell barrier

21
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:55,049
so the cell membrane is a barrier but

22
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,399
nutrients have to get into the cell

23
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:59,099
because the cell needs those to be a

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,259
survive and products and waste must get

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,239
out of the cell so while this is a

26
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,179
barrier it can't be completely solid it

27
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,379
has to be exchanging certain things

28
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,750
permeability determines what moves in

29
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:10,829
and out of the cell and here we have our

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,599
red blood cells

31
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:17,310
what's co2 in this case coming in and

32
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:19,199
then it's translating transported

33
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,650
through Co tool that have to leave the

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,930
cells so this cell barrier this membrane

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,030
is allowing certain things to come in

36
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,720
but also needs a lot of things to go out

37
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,299
of it so the cell barrier would think

38
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,219
about this is it is not impermeable

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,590
which means it would let nothing in or

40
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,868
out like this rock wall it's not freely

41
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,640
permeable well if it lets anything past

42
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:44,099
select this revolving door and you come

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,009
in and out it's what we call selectively

44
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:50,328
permeable it restricts the movement like

45
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,680
the bouncer here at the nightclub or bar

46
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:54,539
so overcoming the cell barrier sometime

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,549
is selectively permeable this is the key

48
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,530
term here for cell barrier it allows

49
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,990
some materials to move freely restricts

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,790
other materials so we could see here the

51
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:06,118
larger molecules are kept on one side

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,310
the small molecules are let through same

53
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:11,719
thing here only certain molecules fill

54
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,719
it through some are repelled

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,360
so restricted materials semi-pro

56
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:18,239
restrict certain materials based on

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,340
could be their size their electrical

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,800
charge their molecular shape their lipid

59
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,409
solubility any one of these can restrict

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,840
the materials to come in hydrophobic

61
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,810
materials our lipid Seibel can pass

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,209
right through the membrane rapidly polar

63
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,689
molecules do not cross remain very

64
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,930
rapidly now polar number of water lipids

65
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,878
are kind of like those waxy coatings and

66
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,099
transport proteins are allow passage of

67
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,530
hydrophilic surfaces across the membrane

68
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,539
so these transport proteins these are

69
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,250
those things we saw embedded in the

70
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:53,848
membrane they can allow certain things

71
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:56,669
to come through membrane function all

72
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:57,869
cells around a plasma membrane cell

73
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:00,059
membranes are composed of a lipid

74
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,459
bilayer with globular proteins embedded

75
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,840
in that bilayer so again look at another

76
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,140
example of this picture of this cell

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,229
here we have our phospholipid bilayer

78
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:13,439
here with our heads and tails from our

79
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:16,289
lipid based tails phospho base or

80
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,530
charged base polar heads clean this

81
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:23,000
bilayer in here we have our integral

82
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,289
proteins they could be channel proteins

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,900
peripheral proteins to sexists on the

84
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,409
outside glycoproteins are protein as the

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,959
carbohydrate remember glycol think

86
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:36,000
glucose a glycolipid is a lipid or the

87
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,439
carbohydrate attached certain things

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,568
here and these are important for

89
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,939
recognition and also allowing things to

90
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:44,668
pass through so here's that same picture

91
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,500
on the function again the membrane the

92
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,560
external surface carbohydrate groups

93
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,109
Jordans lipids from inform glycolipids

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,780
and with proteins are from glycoproteins

95
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:56,790
these functions per cell identity marker

96
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,219
so this is an important aspect want to

97
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:01,019
make sure we're identifying things that

98
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,120
are occurring it's kind of like you in

99
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:06,780
school when you're wearing your IDs this

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,599
is a way for cells to identify what

101
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,609
they're bumping into or what's what's

102
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:17,009
one cell differ than another cell this

103
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,810
membrane is not absolutely rigid

104
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:21,689
structure like we saw with the rock wall

105
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,629
so we call it fluid mosaic so fluid like

106
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:25,750
water and the waves here and mosaic all

107
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,389
these little pieces

108
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,529
together to form the mosaic of the eagle

109
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:35,620
flying so what this fluid mosaic is is

110
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:38,649
we have our hydrophobic remember fearing

111
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,879
water tails mana lipids and our

112
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:44,589
phosphate heads this fluid mosaic this

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,540
reading bottle cap shows our rotating

114
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:48,069
care this shows a little bit better of

115
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,010
an idea that it's kind of like moving

116
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:53,740
it's not a rigid structure it's got this

117
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,930
fluid mosaic like model it's able to

118
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,509
move a little bit and this mosaic like

119
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,319
appearance is what's causing the overall

120
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:05,289
look so looking specifically at the

121
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,089
details we have our hydrophilic head and

122
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,910
our hydrophobic tails remember our

123
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:12,909
saturated and unsaturated fatty acids

124
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,580
from our macromolecules and our

125
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:19,320
hydrophilic head the phosphate and the

126
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:23,229
glycerol here know was saturated

127
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:26,639
everything is single bonds their tails

128
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:29,110
are very straight and if it's mixed with

129
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,509
unsaturated you'll know it's a double

130
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,040
bond forms and our unsaturated causing

131
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:37,089
this little kink of this old kick in the

132
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,490
tail the phospholipid bilayer mainly two

133
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:42,069
layers of phospholipids then non-polar

134
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,050
tails point inwards here and the polar

135
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:45,909
heads and the surface some of these

136
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,040
contain cholesterol especially in animal

137
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,960
cells it's fluid a lot of proteins to

138
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,100
move around within the bilayer so

139
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,769
there's proteins that we saw are not

140
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,240
fixed in one location they can move and

141
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:57,519
push out some of these and move their

142
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,329
way through the phospholipid bilayer

143
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:03,430
they can form the sheet or some of these

144
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:07,779
kind of circular vesicle like locating

145
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:09,819
structures the cholesterol effect

146
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:11,439
membrane fluidity within animal cells

147
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:14,709
and their membranes you can see here's

148
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,329
cholesterol down in there so we want to

149
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:18,489
keep our cholesterol low but we want to

150
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:19,899
don't want to be zero we want to have

151
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,160
some cholesterol next it's going to

152
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:26,199
affect the permeability of our

153
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,340
phospholipid bilayer in this case in the

154
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,099
cholesterol that we're getting measured

155
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,899
in our blood is different than us this

156
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,050
is actually bound up the cholesterol in

157
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:38,139
our blood is moving through our vesicles

158
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,430
and involving in coming in contact with

159
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,310
red blood cells this

160
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:46,600
is embedded in all animal cells and

161
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:49,600
membranes membrane proteins membranes

162
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,360
are this kind of embedded Parshin here

163
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,010
in the lipid bilayer peripheral proteins

164
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,360
are proteins that are opinions that are

165
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:57,430
loosely bound to the surface of the

166
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,500
membrane so these peripheral proteins

167
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,269
are on the outside okay they're not

168
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,709
going all the way through it could be

169
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:04,839
important for recognition doesn't mean

170
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:06,489
they're not important integral proteins

171
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,649
could pass the entire way through and

172
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,300
channel proteins also pass the entire

173
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:12,370
way through the phospholipid bilayer

174
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,509
keep in mind is peripheral proteins as

175
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,280
well as these integral and channel

176
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,949
proteins can work their way and move

177
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,109
through the lipid bilayer just like you

178
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:23,110
moving through a busy crowd same thing

179
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,180
with these proteins are proteins

180
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,939
penetrate a hydrophobic core in a lipid

181
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,560
bilayer often transmembrane proteins

182
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:31,149
completely spanning the number in the

183
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,399
car channel are an integral proteins

184
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:35,979
here there's mother of renditions and

185
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,620
showing that there is the external and

186
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:42,129
internal conditions of the cell being

187
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,230
spanned by these proteins solutions and

188
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,870
transport remember solution could be a

189
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,150
homogenous mixture

190
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,519
competiveness two or more components

191
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:53,919
this cell vent and the solute the

192
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,799
solvent is that those is the dissolving

193
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,110
medium and the solute is the components

194
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,129
and smaller chronic in the solution so

195
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,980
an example here of salt water solvents

196
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:08,379
the dissolving medium that is the water

197
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:12,430
our solute in this case would be the

198
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:14,230
salt intercellular fluid neoplasm inside

199
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,350
a sovereign inside the cell and

200
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,790
extracellular fluid it's on the outside

201
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,910
can be flat a platform we're talking

202
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:24,939
about blood cells I'm interested inside

203
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:28,600
in this case it's tissue fluid could be

204
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:30,850
your extra cell fluid is an example of

205
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,970
that and it's exterior of the cells or

206
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,320
tissues so something I want to the thing

207
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,879
about when I look at ourselves and our

208
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,040
recognition and some of the other videos

209
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,399
might be helpful is are some moments

210
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,860
like nightclubs are they allowing and

211
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,620
certain things to come in and basically

212
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,899
bouncing or rejecting other things from

213
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,149
coming in and how do they go about this

214
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,299
how does recognition in cell

215
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,240
communication and I

216
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:58,159
these come into play here so the cell

217
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,930
membrane is important that it doesn't

218
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,049
want to let anything just come in and

219
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:05,629
out wants to help regulate that so how

220
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:08,479
are these integral proteins and the

221
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:10,399
basic structure of the phospholipid and

222
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,399
pay attention that word phospho and

223
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,950
lipid bilayer coming into play good

224
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,309
questions to ask and related to cell

225
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,310
membranes
