1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,679
here we're on touch on the types of

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,359
proteins as a general quick short

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:09,210
summary there are many different types

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,679
of proteins keep in mind that the types

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,750
of proteins can be defined by their

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,990
shape because that will help determine

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,759
potentially their function so just

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,379
general types of proteins well they all

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,970
have different functions but share the

10
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,849
same building blocks and those building

11
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:26,729
blocks are amino acids some examples or

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,460
classifications of proteins we used as

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,260
an enzymes degrees for transport some

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,359
proteins are structural such as collagen

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,870
or keratin somebody's for defense

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,789
some are contractile so looking again at

17
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,679
our specific types of proteins well the

18
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,899
ribosomes are important for protein

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,808
assembly and it can be they can be

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,030
free-floating in the cytosol and also be

21
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:50,519
attached to the endoplasmic reticulum

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,399
for bisko's a type of protein that's

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,449
involved in the photosynthetic process

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,210
pepsin is an enzyme found in your

25
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:58,649
stomach to help break down food actin

26
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,500
filaments are structural components of

27
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,750
your hair giving it its strength despite

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,760
its very small diameter and insulin is

29
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,909
important for regulation of your blood

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,740
glucose levels all specific types and

31
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,700
related to proteins so there's two main

32
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,359
classifications we're looking at protein

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,040
structure

34
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,430
there's the structural ones which are

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,500
long tables that provide shape and

36
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,590
strength so for example they just gave

37
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,180
your hair as these long kind of cable

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,950
like structures and then there's your

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,270
globular here these are grooves and

40
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,600
depressions either kind of foam this

41
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:36,810
more three-dimensional globe like shape

42
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,759
and these are typically enzymes and also

43
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,960
human globin has this type of

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,739
classification protein functions there's

45
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,989
three examples of protein functions here

46
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,789
we have transport so some proteins

47
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,879
transport various substances such as

48
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,820
oxygen ions and so on this example

49
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,319
provided here's hemoglobin so human limb

50
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,019
is a very specific shape that it takes

51
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,389
on these are the heme units the iron

52
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:07,379
units and this is important in your red

53
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,878
blood cells for carrying oxygen now I

54
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,189
said structure bleeds to function so

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,469
shape has a direct impact on function

56
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:15,479
normal red blood cells this nice

57
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,810
cross section we call this biconcave

58
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,340
disk they look like this and then we

59
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,009
have this abnormal condition called

60
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,890
sickle cell they have this weird sickle

61
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,989
kinda Halfmoon shape to them and it

62
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:30,989
greatly impacts the function of red

63
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,210
blood cells so here we have a normal red

64
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,490
blood cell and then here we have the

65
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,129
sickle shaped the normal red blood cells

66
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,460
are smooth they're round and they're

67
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,799
called

68
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,780
I time cave discs they move very easily

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,780
through our capillaries and through our

70
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,419
vessels arteries and veins in our

71
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,360
circulatory system they transport oxygen

72
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:53,429
very efficiently sickle cell shaped is

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,750
you have sickle cell anemia don't move

74
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,490
easily through the blood they're stiff

75
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,990
and sticky they tend to form these

76
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,659
clumps and get stuck in blood vessels

77
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:04,350
there's not a good thing this can block

78
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,750
blood flow blood blood vessels to limbs

79
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:09,030
to organs and it's good cause serious

80
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,360
infection or organ damage this is not a

81
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,490
good condition to have also they could

82
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,080
just look at the shape not as efficient

83
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:21,209
at carrying oxygen another function of

84
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,040
proteins can be information transfer

85
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,699
look at the example here of certain

86
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,409
protein hormones or peptide hormones I

87
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:31,129
insulin is an example because it helps

88
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:33,389
control the amount of sugar in the blood

89
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:36,060
your body needs to maintain homeostasis

90
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:38,969
it needs to maintain a very controlled

91
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:44,430
amount of blood glucose levels insulin

92
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:46,530
will help keep that in check also

93
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,519
important for defense in the form of

94
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,560
antibodies

95
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,209
it marks foreign bodies for illumination

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,180
here we have our antigens are antibodies

97
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,400
these are very important shape you could

98
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:01,769
see here is all distinctive shape this

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,450
again relates to proteins here lastly

100
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,819
our protein functions they can form a

101
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,280
catalyst so almost all the chemical

102
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,949
reactions that are in a living cell are

103
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,110
catalyzed by enzymes in general when

104
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,419
enzyme does is it reduces the amount of

105
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,639
energy needed to reach an end product so

106
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,310
here to combine a with B without the

107
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,379
enzyme would take this much energy

108
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,870
before produced the complex a B

109
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:28,750
with enzymes here taking a lot less

110
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,970
energy to produce the same end result in

111
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,069
this example we'll notice that the time

112
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,410
it takes to produce with or without the

113
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:37,689
enzyme is the same however what is

114
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,490
reduced is the amount of energy without

115
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:41,490
enzymes we would not be able to survive
