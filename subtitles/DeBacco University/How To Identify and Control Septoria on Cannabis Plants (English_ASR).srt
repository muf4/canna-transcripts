1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,359
if you have leaves that look like this

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,519
on your cannabis plant

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,359
odds are you probably have septoria in

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,480
this tobacco university video we'll

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,480
provide you with

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:17,829
proper identification as well as control

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:20,880
techniques for this particular disease

8
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:22,239
[Music]

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,278
all right let's look at how to identify

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,598
and control septoria on cannabis plants

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,399
so first off proper identification is

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,559
important

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,238
inceptory leaf spot can cause leaf loss

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,159
and reduction in photosynthesis

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,599
and is one of the most common leaf spot

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,519
pathogens among

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
hemp leaf spot diseases and we can see a

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,120
great image of that here

19
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,280
scout lower leaves and within the inner

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,320
canopy where leaf wetness and high

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,759
humidity occur

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
as this is likely a place for the

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,519
disease to start look for small

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,559
irregular shaped spots with bright

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,239
yellow margins

26
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,679
spots expand to about a quarter inch in

27
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,279
diameter and appear brown with

28
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,878
predominant yellow halo

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,960
so you can see here that predominant

30
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,878
yellow halo clearly evident

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,799
as spots in large brown areas become

32
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:03,759
more regular and develop gray to white

33
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,759
centers

34
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,000
yellow halos expand outwards from those

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,760
spots the entire leaf rapidly becomes

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,959
yellow and can drop from plants in

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,240
advanced cases so the life cycle of

38
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,438
septoria

39
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,679
and looking at from two different

40
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,438
aspects here showing you kind of what's

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,560
happening in those little spots

42
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,319
showing you kind of all those little

43
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,960
fungal spores that are developing the

44
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,559
pathogen can overwinter as mycelium

45
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,319
and then can reinfect plants the

46
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,879
following year so it's good to clean

47
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,399
those portions up we're seeing an

48
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,280
example here if again wind and rain

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,439
splash spores kind of knocking those off

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,680
those can then go through and develop as

51
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,719
early lesions as yellow spots on newly

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,320
emerged plants

53
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,078
the cycle can repeat itself if

54
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,078
conditions are favorable when those

55
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,959
leaves do drop off the plant

56
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,559
they serve as overwintering areas now

57
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,319
this is showing soybeans but the same

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,399
thing does apply to cannabis

59
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,239
where the overwinting spore can occur

60
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,359
proper conditions cause it to kind of

61
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,879
proliferate and affect new plants so how

62
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,478
do you go about managing this and this

63
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,078
kind of shows a really good kind of

64
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,759
zoomed in version here

65
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,919
while this is not cannabis this is

66
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,280
showing you the great image of what

67
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
septoria can look like

68
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,439
this is an example of it in cannabis

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,239
when excessive moisture or high humidity

70
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,400
is available

71
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,239
the fungal life cycles are shorter and

72
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
larger number of spores are produced

73
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
both

74
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,639
negative things if you're looking at

75
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,080
trying to mitigate this disease

76
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,839
so this can increase the chance of

77
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,440
disease later in plants life cycle when

78
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,280
the plants are more dense

79
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,878
during rainy summers disease can spread

80
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,878
rapidly through fields if you're growing

81
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,479
this in an outdoor application

82
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,318
separatory species can overwinter in

83
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,159
fields unaffected plant debris

84
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,839
under cool conditions with low relative

85
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,120
humidity the

86
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,280
pinidia can remain viable for up to nine

87
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,920
months in debris

88
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,080
the in contrast piniti survives

89
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,159
decreased dramatically in hot weather

90
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
and when in buried soils for example

91
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,919
tilling for less than one month

92
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,599
so if you do have infected material over

93
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,598
large scale and you till that in

94
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,639
that can be a way to reduce the life

95
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,639
expectancy

96
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,000
of septoria although although

97
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,839
alternative hosts have not been

98
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
identified for septoria's species that

99
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,959
cause leaf spot in hemp

100
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
it is likely that weeds and other

101
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,158
similar green bridges are responsible

102
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,318
for survival

103
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,679
from one growing season to the next and

104
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,799
we're still looking at investigating

105
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,640
this more

106
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,080
but odds are these green bridges it

107
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,119
spreads to another

108
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,560
weed host another disease host resides

109
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,239
there and then the following year it can

110
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,199
then jump from that original host that

111
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,000
it carried over

112
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:31,439
and infect your hemp plants so hopefully

113
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
this gives you a little insight into

114
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,439
septoria

115
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,439
which is sadly very commonly seen on

116
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,439
cannabis
