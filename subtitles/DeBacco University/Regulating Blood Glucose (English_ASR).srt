1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
here we're going to look at how the body

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,679
goes about regulating blood glucose

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:09,089
levels in order to maintain homeostasis

4
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:11,279
how the body goes about doing this is

5
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:13,109
the pancreas is involved that's

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,178
responsible for monitoring blood glucose

7
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:18,269
levels specifically the islet of

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,859
Langerhans now when we say homeostasis

9
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:21,719
isn't mean everything's a complete

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,760
flatline there Kim you can do as

11
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,759
fluctuations but they will occur within

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,529
narrow limits for example when glucose

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,810
levels are high insulin will be released

14
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:33,179
when levels are low glucagon will be

15
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:34,558
released we see a nice graph here we're

16
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,019
looking at our blood glucose levels in

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,939
red and our insulin levels here in this

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,530
bluish purple color we can see that

19
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,750
there are fluctuations throughout the

20
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,640
day but overall this is kept in a very

21
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,549
tight range so our body can go about

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,780
maintaining homeostasis looking at this

23
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,909
in a pictorial sense we have our

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,510
pancreas here we have two situations one

25
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,948
could be low blood sugar that's gonna we

26
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,339
want our Vice want to increase our blood

27
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:58,259
sugar

28
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,410
glucagon will be released promoting

29
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,628
glycogen breakdown the liver in contrast

30
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:05,518
to that we have high blood sugar we're

31
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,170
gonna want to decrease that blood sugar

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,390
and we're gonna do that with insulin

33
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,260
insulin is going to do two things it's

34
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,879
gonna promote glycogen synthesis it's

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,580
also going to stimulate glucose uptake

36
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,780
in tissue cells and overall that will

37
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:23,700
lead to a decrease in our blood sugar

38
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,978
now when we have that high blood glucose

39
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,799
we call it hyperglycemia so here would

40
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:30,269
be our normal blood sugar levels and we

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
consume orange juice or something has a

42
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,188
lot of sugar and now we are in I bow my

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,829
Samiha state insulin is going to be

44
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,359
released by beta cells in the pancreas

45
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:41,489
so and that's gonna initiate three

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,799
things insulins effects first it's gonna

47
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,750
trigger body cells to take up glucose

48
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,479
from blood and utilize it in cellular

49
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,590
respiration it's also going to inhibit

50
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,269
two processes like a genesis is one

51
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,340
where glucose is removed from the blood

52
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:58,170
and stored in glycogen in the liver it's

53
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,710
going to inhibit that step it's also

54
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,299
going to inhibit amino acids and fully

55
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:05,218
glycerols that are not converted to

56
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,009
glucose in the ER you may remember

57
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:11,159
macromolecules rough smooth ER this is

58
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:13,899
gluten Genesis that will be also

59
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,509
inhibited in a hypoglycemic State

60
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,800
whew tonight we're trying to get rid of

61
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:20,530
some of this blood sugar we're trying to

62
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,060
store it so this is what we're gonna buy

63
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,110
is gonna go through and help trigger

64
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,819
these events to reduce blood glucose in

65
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,489
contrast to that we have our homeostasis

66
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:31,839
and I went low blood glucose well

67
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:33,849
glucagon is gonna be released by the

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,680
alpha cells in the pancreas and that's

69
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:38,500
basically going to do the opposite of

70
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,530
what we just saw in that hyperglycemia

71
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,360
state now where it stimulated or insulin

72
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,629
stimulates this is going to inhibit and

73
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,400
where insulin inhibited this is going to

74
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:51,340
stimulate so it's basically the reverse

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,920
that and the whole goal here is to a

76
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,289
blood glucose concentration increase to

77
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,078
get us up to this range here after our

78
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:00,578
hypoglycemic State looking at this where

79
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:03,099
we look at both parts together and see

80
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:05,950
that here where we have our stimulus of

81
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:07,750
blood glucose levels cupcake beta cells

82
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:10,659
in the pancreas release our insulin that

83
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,299
insulin signals the liver to take up

84
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:15,370
glucose and store it as mikage in our

85
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:17,260
body cells will also take up glucose as

86
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,230
a result blood glucose levels will

87
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:22,030
decline reaching homeostasis after a

88
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:23,858
period time a blood glucose levels fall

89
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,709
pink alpha cells in the pancreas will at

90
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:29,370
least glucagon and the liver will break

91
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:31,719
down the glucagon to release glucose

92
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,299
overall blood glucose levels will rise

93
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,729
helping us maintain this homeostasis so

94
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:39,040
hopefully this kind of feedback system

95
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:41,229
makes sense and helps develop a better

96
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,348
understanding how the body maintains

97
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:47,229
blood glucose levels to keep homeostasis

98
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:49,949
and allow the normal functions of the

99
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,949
body to continue
