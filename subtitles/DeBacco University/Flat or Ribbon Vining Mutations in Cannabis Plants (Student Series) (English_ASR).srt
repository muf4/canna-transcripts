1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,759
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,119
going to look at another student series

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,439
video we're going to look at flat or

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,120
ribbon vining mutations in cannabis

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,599
plants we're going to go out to the

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,919
greenhouse bay look at the variability

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,839
you can get from using seeds even though

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,000
they're from the same variety some of

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,600
the mutations that can develop and

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,278
connor's going to walk us through just

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,278
what we're seeing out in the greenhouse

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,159
[Music]

13
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,159
well what we're seeing here is a few of

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,640
our mutations that we have on this bay

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,398
uh this whole bay was from one cultivar

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,679
one seed

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,120
it is our baox strain it is a high cbd

18
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,320
variety

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,439
here in front of me you can see a

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
healthy

21
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,558
normal looking plant very uniform

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,399
christmas tree like shape

23
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,558
you know no branches out of the ordinary

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,160
nice skinny strong

25
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,359
center branch

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,599
stock

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,119
um then you take a look to my right and

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
you can see

29
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,560
a stock almost three to four times the

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,439
thickness of our normal healthy plant

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,079
and

32
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,359
it's very tall compared to our

33
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,640
healthy plant

34
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,879
um another

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,478
distinctive characteristic is this big

36
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,158
split in the middle and i did not top

37
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,239
this in any form

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,479
with scissors or anything it was all on

39
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,640
its own

40
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,879
we think it's a mutation of some sort of

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,040
the main stem almost like a conjoined

42
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,399
twin

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,079
and if you look over here on the left

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,920
you see this monstrosity

45
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,719
very bushy tops

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,960
a stem that is almost three to four

47
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,560
times as wide as a normal

48
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,879
healthy stem

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,640
you see these big tufts of new growth on

50
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,839
the main

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,159
stem

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,200
and what you can see is that

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
this left

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,439
leftmost stem has actually started to

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,799
curl and grow upside down at a 180

56
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,199
degree angle

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,840
the new growth is pointing downwards

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,240
and growing downwards as well

59
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
and another notable characteristic is

60
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,118
how

61
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,520
skinny

62
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,598
the stalk is on its side

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,120
on one angle it's very wide and at the

64
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:19,280
other it almost looks normal

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,120
and yeah that's some of our fun

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,400
interesting cool mutations that we're

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,400
seeing in our greenhouse currently
