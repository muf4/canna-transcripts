1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
so you want to learn more about rockwell

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,519
for indoor cannabis production

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,120
we've come to the right place here on

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:07,758
tobacco university where we're going to

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:16,480
explain

6
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:18,000
just that

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
all right let's get into rockwell for

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,320
indoor cannabis production

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,839
first off there's many potential uses

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,599
for rockwool

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,278
it can be used at any stage of growth of

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,879
cannabis production not just clones like

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,480
a lot of people associate it with

14
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,399
some growers prefer to use it only in

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,799
the early stages but it can be used to

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,359
fill

17
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,679
for full term other growers will grow

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,200
plants in it for the entire grow cycle

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,719
so you may choose to use it for only a

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,920
portion you may choose it to use it for

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,439
the entire growth cycle

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,719
it's entirely up to you but i'm going to

23
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,359
provide you with some of the details

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,160
about it

25
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,640
so you can make an educated decision so

26
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,078
first off

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,079
are the basics of just kind of like what

28
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,759
is rockwool um in general

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,280
well rockwell is a lightweight substrate

30
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,960
made from spinning molten

31
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,799
uh balsic rock into fine fibers

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,280
it's commonly used in hydroponic growing

33
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,438
setups especially in commercial settings

34
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,640
it's formed into a range of cubes and

35
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,279
blocks and growing

36
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,840
slabs large blue slabs and also granular

37
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
products

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,760
so because it is kind of this uh

39
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,639
stonewool or rockwool kind of

40
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,960
insulation-like

41
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,239
material it can be made it's

42
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,719
manufactured it can be made into

43
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,280
different

44
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,840
shapes sizes to allow it to be utilized

45
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,200
for different parts of the growth cycle

46
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,880
so what are the properties of it why are

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,320
so many people using it

48
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,719
well rockwell can have good balance

49
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,719
between the ability to hold water

50
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,759
and still provide sufficient aeration

51
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,599
for the roots

52
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,200
hydroponic setups often use rockwell

53
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,039
because it has a slow drain time which

54
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,680
allows for feeding and watering

55
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,360
and it can be also be very specific here

56
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,079
we see a rockwool cube sitting on a bed

57
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,719
of perlite

58
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,118
with a cannabis clone in it so again all

59
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,158
these

60
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,959
are reasons why rockwool is so

61
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,159
popular with many growers so what are

62
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,599
some of the benefits you know

63
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,520
so we said look some of the properties

64
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,959
some of the advantages well that natural

65
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,319
balance between holding water and

66
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,640
aeration

67
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,919
aeration are conducive for root growth

68
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
in development and who doesn't want

69
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,799
bigger better

70
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,759
routes lightweight which can reduce the

71
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,200
shipping expense

72
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,038
and provides a sterile growing

73
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,719
environment so not only can it ship

74
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,238
fairly easily because it's lightweight

75
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,639
does take up some volume

76
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,439
but as far as the weight isn't a great

77
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,598
deal

78
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,280
it can also provide a sterile growing

79
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,399
environment works great to reduce the

80
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,239
chance of

81
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,319
implementing any sort of disease

82
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,878
especially on the early stages of growth

83
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:28,719
but really

84
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,919
for all stages that it's being utilized

85
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,400
in

86
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,318
however you do want to watch out for out

87
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,840
the algal growth here that can occur in

88
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:36,479
the sense of with water and holding

89
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,640
water and

90
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,799
light with grow lights or sunlight that

91
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,878
can also cause addly to grow

92
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,239
also disposal can be an issue due to the

93
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,039
fact that it really doesn't comp

94
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,319
decompose or break down all that well so

95
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,400
you want to be thinking about the kind

96
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,159
of full growth cycle there

97
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,599
of okay if i'm going to use it here

98
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,639
where is it all we're going to end up

99
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,799
and can i dispose of it properly

100
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,719
some options for rockwell they said it's

101
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,319
kind of a manufactured product so it can

102
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,120
be offered in a variety of

103
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,479
situations and sizes there's some small

104
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,239
little starter plugs

105
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,318
there's some slightly larger cubes

106
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,759
there's bigger blocks and then we get

107
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,158
into the slabs

108
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,840
so some of the companies start with

109
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,439
little starter plugs and we can see here

110
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,319
is a larger cube well that starter plug

111
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,560
will fit

112
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,399
very easily into that cube then that

113
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
cube can be placed on a block and that

114
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,680
block can be placed on the slabs that

115
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,519
can allow those roots to fully expand

116
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,040
and helps minimize root disturbance and

117
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,760
allow this product to be used for the

118
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,400
entire

119
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,759
grow cycle now how would you prepare

120
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,560
rockwolf is this something you are

121
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,679
considering

122
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,598
we want to always check with the

123
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,879
manufacturer but at the very least

124
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,119
rockwell will need to

125
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,399
have a pre-soak in water before going in

126
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,319
planting in it

127
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
some needs to be soaked in water to help

128
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,759
regulate the ph something can just be

129
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,439
soaked in regular water

130
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,359
it's still however a good idea to check

131
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,598
the soaking waters ph before

132
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
during and after the rock will soak to

133
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,878
help ensure that this will

134
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,959
not be an unexpected stress on the

135
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,039
plants and limit their nutrient

136
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,360
availability

137
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,560
lastly that water soaked targets so said

138
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,920
about soaking your water well what

139
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,438
should target should you be

140
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,199
well depending if you're using rockwell

141
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,919
for the propagation or growth cycle

142
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,598
the targets may vary slightly however in

143
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,798
general you should be shooting for a ph

144
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,399
around 5.3 to 5.5 a parts per million

145
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,959
content of around 400

146
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,719
at temperature around 65 to 70.

147
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,319
typically a soak time of two to five

148
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,120
minutes will help ensure the air bubbles

149
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,759
are removed

150
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,680
and full absorption has occurred we can

151
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,319
see that point of saturation here

152
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,759
in the grower here taking the ph reading

153
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,319
all good things that are shown in the

154
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,759
picture

155
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,439
and all good things you should be

156
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,160
implementing in the practice if you're

157
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,160
looking at

158
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,160
growing your plants in rockwool
