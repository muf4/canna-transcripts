1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,839
okay in this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:08,638
we're looking at the 2019 cbd cultivar

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,000
trial data summary from cornell hemp

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,919
research facility

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,519
so there's a lot of great information in

6
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,679
this i'm going to try to provide a brief

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,199
overview you're welcome to pause the

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,679
video to take a look at some

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,679
of the information presented as well as

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,600
look in the description for the source

11
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,518
cited uh where you can potentially find

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,000
this information for your uh to look at

13
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,598
it even further in more detail

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,278
so let's get started first off the

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
cultivar details

16
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,600
this is a list of all the cultivars

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,600
there's 30 cultivars used in this study

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,359
that can be seen in this list in

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,160
addition the information provided is the

20
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,640
propagation material used which included

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,679
dioecious seeds as you can see here

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,558
feminized seeds

23
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,280
there's a couple listed and whether it

24
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,159
came from

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
a clone we can see the clones here now

26
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,319
many people are always looking at you

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,120
know we're the source of this

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,679
information

29
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,479
and this is the source where these

30
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,439
cultivars

31
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,640
and propagation material was acquired in

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,878
addition

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
if it was grown from seed we're looking

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,000
at the percent

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,799
germination from those from those seeds

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
we can see those

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,320
listed here something having very high

38
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,719
percentage of germinations some having

39
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,199
very

40
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,478
low percentage the nas are not

41
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,920
applicable of course applied to the

42
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,159
clones because they have no

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
germination and then we see the percent

44
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
female which is very important

45
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,359
now if they're dioecious we would expect

46
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,560
them to be 50 most of them are hovering

47
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,079
around that range

48
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
if they're feminized we're looking of

49
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,759
course ideally at a hundred percent

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,078
but that doesn't always occur here we

51
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,439
see a feminist seat of 95 percent

52
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,199
that's that means five percent of those

53
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,158
could be male and it's important always

54
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,478
to take a look

55
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,600
and here's the list of the 30 cultivars

56
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,799
again

57
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,399
now that we have the observed cbd to thc

58
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,360
ratio so while the ratios were

59
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,879
consistently between

60
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,879
20 to 1 and 30 to 1 remember it is not

61
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,199
about the ratio but the percentage of

62
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,319
thc that defines a plant as hemp or

63
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,799
marijuana

64
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,679
as noted in this trial most high cbd

65
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,240
cultivars

66
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
will not be compliant with the 0.3 total

67
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,478
tc

68
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,679
threshold so it's just important

69
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,359
remember just because it's a very high

70
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,280
cbd producer

71
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,800
it doesn't matter the ratio matters the

72
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,199
amount of thc

73
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
produced percentage of tg produced to be

74
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,159
classified as temporary marijuana from a

75
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,080
federal level

76
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,318
the sampling technique so what was

77
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,000
utilized here the cornell researchers

78
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,679
sampled all 30 cultivars

79
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,598
each week after terminal flowering to

80
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,920
track cannabinoid accumulation

81
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,079
they also sample dried and stripped

82
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,119
biomass from all 30 cultivars

83
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,319
because of the consistent cbdtg ratio

84
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,000
cultivars that exceed 7.9 percent

85
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:42,000
cbd will also exceed the 0.3 percent

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,199
total thc because it's a fixed ratio of

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,560
cbd to thc

88
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,639
so again just keep that caveat in mind

89
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
now we're looking at total cbd and this

90
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,039
is kind of a very interesting

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,759
graph here the total cbd and total thc

92
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,000
accumulating curves for all 30 cultivars

93
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,759
are kind of indicated by the colors here

94
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,919
most cultivars accumulate high levels of

95
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,158
cannabinoids by week two or three

96
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,878
the top 10 10 centimeters of shoot tips

97
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:10,239
were sampled and cannabis were

98
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,598
quantified using an hplc high pressure

99
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,120
liquid chromatography

100
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,280
and then overall we can see a general

101
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,878
trend here of from weeks from terminal

102
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,878
flowering we see that increase

103
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,079
this dotted line represents the total

104
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,479
potential thc

105
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,760
and that represents the 0.3 level of

106
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,158
federal limit

107
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,919
now most most people think that the cbd

108
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,280
and thc naturally correlate with each

109
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,079
other and we see that true in a lot of

110
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,439
the cases

111
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
but i want to draw your attention to

112
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,919
these two curves right here

113
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,958
where we see the total potential cbd

114
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,359
peaking early

115
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,840
and then actually dipping as weeks after

116
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,400
terminal flower going on and as those

117
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,280
cbd percentages dip we're seeing an

118
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,158
exponential

119
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
increase here in thc so this is where

120
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,598
also it may come

121
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,158
to be important based on what cultivars

122
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,919
you might be

123
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,679
growing or what strains you might be

124
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,238
growing as far as when you harvest again

125
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,080
this is all above that 0.3 level

126
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
but in certain cultivars this might be

127
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,400
below that 0.3 level and then

128
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
increase later in the season so timing

129
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,120
of harvest

130
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,719
can also potentially play a role

131
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,640
depending on what cultivar you might be

132
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,799
growing again in these examples

133
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,158
this would be all above that 0.3 level

134
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
but just something to consider that it

135
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,719
doesn't always correlate

136
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,840
with cbd and thc

137
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,199
now flowering time is strongly

138
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,839
correlated with exceeding the 0.3 total

139
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
thc

140
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,439
threshold so what is this showing well

141
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,279
this is a timelapse growing the season

142
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,918
milestones for the 30 hemp cultivars

143
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,599
yet again some cultivars mostly favoring

144
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,359
those early flowering ones

145
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,720
i had two distinct flowering groups

146
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,479
early represented with the

147
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,080
capital e and we can see here's the

148
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,918
early flowering group

149
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,918
cultivars are ordered from the earliest

150
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,399
flowering at the very top here

151
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,599
to the latest flowering down here at the

152
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,198
bottom no offense

153
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
late sioux is one of the latest

154
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,360
flowering varieties

155
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,040
the vertical black line here indicates

156
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,400
uh the transplant date of

157
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,720
june 5th day lengths are listed along

158
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,198
the top of the plot at 30 day intervals

159
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,680
here

160
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,560
and what we're noticing is in particular

161
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,959
of importance

162
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,560
sample exceeding is greater than 0.3

163
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,239
percent total thc

164
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,759
and here we see what those that had the

165
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,600
earlier flowering groups

166
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,759
they were much more likely to exceed at

167
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
0.3 level at an early

168
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,439
part of the growing season those that

169
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,680
were later to flower

170
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,918
we see a typically a trend here where it

171
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,680
becomes later that they would exceed

172
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,399
potentially that 0.3

173
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,079
thc level there so again just some good

174
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,679
information here to kind of look at

175
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,839
and see the difference that cultivar

176
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,439
selection can make

177
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,439
now in addition to looking at

178
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,279
cannabinoids and

179
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,639
terpenes we also want to consider

180
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,119
disease resistance

181
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
so powdery mildew susceptibility there

182
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
were significant differences in powdery

183
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,918
mildew

184
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,160
susceptibility by the cultivars the

185
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,159
mccarthy's

186
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,439
site a had more powdery mildew than the

187
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,439
bluegrass lane

188
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,918
site b so overall this site just had

189
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,000
more powdery mildew than the other

190
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,839
data were logged transformed for the

191
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
blue s lane farm trial

192
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,879
letters indicate statistically

193
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,879
significant differences between

194
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,000
cultivars based on the post hoc tukey's

195
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,560
hsd

196
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,319
test that's with statistics while we can

197
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,399
look at all the data here what is

198
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,639
definitely an interesting note is that

199
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,839
no powdery mildew was observed on first

200
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,439
light 58. so that is kind of very

201
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,758
interesting it's indicated by the letter

202
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,519
a

203
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,520
here so we can see that all the

204
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,159
different letters again no significant

205
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,839
difference so

206
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,360
there's a lot of cultures that share

207
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,679
that but because

208
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,720
first light only has the a alone and no

209
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
other letters

210
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,240
it's kind of a genetic kind of stand out

211
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,120
there where if you have an area with

212
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,519
high powder

213
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,600
mildew you know chance of getting it if

214
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,839
you want a cultivar it's very low

215
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,960
in kind of acquiring that we can see

216
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,959
that these uh

217
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,799
cultivars that have the letter a would

218
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,638
be once initially look at

219
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,919
but definitely early indications that

220
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,720
first light at both

221
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,799
sites basically was observed to have

222
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,400
basically no powdery mildew so again

223
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,439
important consideration there

224
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,079
something to look more into now we have

225
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,038
biomass

226
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,560
and again this would be a great time to

227
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,399
kind of like pause the video here so you

228
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,478
can kind of take a look at the biomass

229
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,399
on the measurements provided this is per

230
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,318
plant averages for biomass measurements

231
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,519
looking at the wet biomass stripped

232
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,680
biomass dry

233
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,758
percent dry and percent strips there and

234
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,879
kind of the differences between the two

235
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,479
so again this gets into a little bit

236
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,680
more of the details of kind of the

237
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,279
amount of biomass

238
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,038
that would be produced you can see here

239
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,318
late sioux again it was one of the later

240
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,199
ones to kind of flower

241
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,520
does produce a very high in comparison

242
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,160
uh

243
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,159
biomass there then we have the

244
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,560
cannabinoid analysis this is where most

245
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,560
growers kind of focus on now cannabinoid

246
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,319
analysis for chemotype 3 which is the

247
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,240
high cbd individuals

248
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,360
note that 7 cultivars also had other

249
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,598
chemotypes 1

250
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,759
and two that consistently exceed that

251
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,878
0.3 percent total thc

252
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,960
threshold the biomass shoot ratio

253
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,879
is the quotient of the average stripped

254
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,279
biomass measurement to the average

255
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,280
last shoot tip measurement i just want

256
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,758
to point out that while a lot of growers

257
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,239
will look at the total cbd percentages

258
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,240
in this column and take a look and see

259
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,918
what they you know can glean from this

260
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,280
but we also want to be mindful of the

261
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,399
ones highlighted in red

262
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:15,359
are over that 0.3 percent

263
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,918
thc level there and because it's a fixed

264
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,960
ratio typically if we exceed that

265
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,639
0.79 cbd that automatically will mean

266
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,878
we're going to be above that total

267
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,478
thc percentage above the federal limit

268
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,840
but in addition to just the main two

269
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,439
we're looking at cbc

270
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,598
cbg levels so there's a lot of

271
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,479
information here another great data

272
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,639
table to take

273
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,320
a look at pause to kind of do a little

274
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,639
comparison if you've been tracking one

275
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,240
of the cultivars throughout here

276
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,639
and then lastly the cultivar just the

277
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,959
general summaries provided here

278
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,879
for chemotype we typically want to avoid

279
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,399
type 1 and type 3.

280
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,639
we want to look at the flowering date

281
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,200
the cbd yield per plant so we can see

282
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,838
that

283
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,240
here the cbd yield in kilograms and

284
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,240
where

285
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,320
and they do flower now keep in mind

286
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
there's a lot of different cultivars

287
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,360
i'm here a lot of different

288
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
considerations to take place but

289
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,519
hopefully this provides at least some

290
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,479
initial

291
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,159
information based on actual research to

292
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,680
help guide your decision

293
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,679
making process
