00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
here on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,839
going to look at

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,359
a carbon dioxide controller that does

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,519
not have fuzzy logic

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,039
and provide you with some details about

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:17,280
this style of

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:20,399
co2 controller

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,000
[Music]

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,000
all right let's look at a carbon dioxide

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
controller without fuzzy logic for

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,759
cannabis production

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,960
so first off what would these be used

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,080
for and while they can be used with

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,760
bottle systems

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,759
they're probably best utilized for

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
carbon dioxide generators

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,280
because even if your controller does

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,079
have fuzzy logic which i'll mention here

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,840
at the end

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,119
it needs to be turned off if you're

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,840
using a generator

22
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,439
as this will not work with this type of

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,960
co2 generation

24
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,558
only bottle based systems should be

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,120
utilizing fuzzy logic

26
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,839
so here we can see the generator is an

27
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,320
on off

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,320
system bottle systems allow for pulse

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,520
dosing which you cannot use with a

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,960
generator system

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,399
there's different forms of generator

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,679
systems you can see here we have

33
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,600
invented here here

34
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,799
and here we have one in a greenhouse

35
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
setting

36
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,000
so when we're looking at these

37
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,600
controllers

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,280
they are set up much in the way that

39
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,519
ones would be with fuzzy logic in the

40
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
sense that you would set a deadband

41
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,679
and what's a deadband well this setting

42
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
decides how tight you want the control

43
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
to keep the carbon dioxide levels to the

44
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,399
target setpoint

45
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,879
essentially how far the controller will

46
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
allow carbon dioxide levels to deviate

47
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,478
from your chosen setting before

48
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,520
targeting your carbon dioxide source

49
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,679
to switch on or off most

50
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,200
controllers default around 50 parts per

51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,799
million but you may want to increase

52
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
this to 100 parts per million for a

53
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,680
generator system

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,759
as it will naturally fluctuate the

55
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,079
levels more than a bottle-based

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,439
system selecting 100 parts per million

57
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,199
as your deadband setting

58
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,719
will allow the growth space levels to be

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
essentially over or

60
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,879
under by 100 parts per million before

61
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,759
the controller turn on or off the

62
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,839
generator

63
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,959
now we'll notice the one the controller

64
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,079
over here next to me

65
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,679
has a deadband setting set to 25. this

66
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,798
would be a little tight to run for a

67
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
generator because it's going to have a

68
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,719
lot more ons and off

69
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,479
cycles which could add unnecessary wear

70
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,239
and tear to your generator

71
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,840
when in doubt start with 50 and you can

72
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
regulate from there

73
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,479
going as low as 25 is possible but it

74
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,239
might see your generator running

75
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,799
on and off with greater frequency so

76
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,759
make sure on the sensors of your

77
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
controller

78
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,759
that there is a presence of a photocell

79
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,199
we see that here

80
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,679
see that labeled right here we see that

81
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,598
here as well this will help ensure that

82
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,360
co2 is only added during the light

83
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,878
period which is only when the plant can

84
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,200
actually utilize it

85
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,919
a time a timer could be used if you have

86
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,759
a regimen

87
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,839
light schedule but the photocell is a

88
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,840
great fail-safe option to ensure carbon

89
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,800
dioxide is only added

90
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,640
when the plants can actually use it a

91
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,319
lot of growers some are some controllers

92
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,159
had growers trying to dial in the time

93
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,280
so it flights on lights off period

94
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,359
but the photocell is great uh for

95
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,120
kind of forgetting about the exact timer

96
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,560
setting in case timers were a little off

97
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,878
also if you're growing in a high tunnel

98
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,400
or greenhouse environment this can also

99
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,639
allow the control to automatically

100
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,360
adjust to seasonal changes in duration

101
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,878
of sunlight or photo period now what is

102
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,599
this fuzzy logic that you'd be missing

103
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,840
out on

104
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,719
well keep in mind that fuzzy logic can

105
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
maximize

106
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,158
a growing cycle with bottle based

107
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,560
systems and what it simply does is it

108
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,039
allows for continuous adjustment

109
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,080
and to automatically ensure efficiency

110
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,280
the reason why this can be used with

111
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,959
bottle based systems

112
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
is the controller will automatically

113
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,239
adjust the frequency and duration

114
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,360
of its pulse dosing this is not possible

115
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,080
with generators because it needs to be

116
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,319
on

117
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,840
or off so just keep that in mind that if

118
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,878
you are looking at potentially going

119
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,878
into

120
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,399
using a generator for now but looking at

121
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:45,840
a bottle system down the road

122
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,760
make sure you get one of the fuzzy logic

123
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,200
so the fuzzy logic can be utilized when

124
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,359
using the bottle based system

125
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,679
but make sure that physiologic is off or

126
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
you get a controller that does not have

127
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,599
fuzzy logic if you're only going to be

128
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,319
using a generated source of carbon

129
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,318
dioxide
