1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,569
okay in this video we're going to go

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,730
over blood types and hopefully give you

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:08,150
a greater understanding than just the

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,309
fact that there's a B and O blood types

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,719
so starting with antibodies and blood

6
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:15,029
transfusions it's very important

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,500
identify someone's blood type if we're

8
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,500
looking at transfusing their blood or

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,660
even donating blood so blood type into

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,629
the system is the major groups of

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,379
red blood cell antigens now at least

12
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:32,840
have here is an example of a person who

13
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:36,119
are Type A here make in device against

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,850
antigen B so if you're a red blood cell

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,039
type a you have antibodies in your

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,140
plasma they're AMT B because your

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,299
antigens are type a as we see indicated

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,159
here by the circles if you're type B

19
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:51,599
blood type B blood type

20
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:53,159
you make antigens against a because your

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,890
antibodies against a because you have

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,218
the antigen B now if you're an a B blood

23
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,619
type

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,050
you don't make any antibodies against a

25
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,939
or B because you express both of these

26
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,978
antigens on the surface of your red

27
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,438
blood cells in contrast to that if

28
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:10,530
you're a group O in this case you do

29
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,118
make antibodies against a EMP because

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,409
you have no markers on your very blood

31
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,969
cells and therefore you're not

32
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:20,490
expressing any antigens continuing on

33
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:21,989
you may have heard of a negative and a

34
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,089
positive or a negative and a positive

35
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,250
and may wonder what the positive and

36
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,000
negative means well this refers to the

37
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,709
Rh factor RH is abbreviation for rhesus

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,078
factor because it was first discovered

39
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,578
in rhesus monkeys it's an antigen

40
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,519
occurring on the red blood cells of many

41
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:41,069
humans about 85% and some other primates

42
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,849
is particularly important as a cause of

43
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:47,069
evil addict disease of newborns and

44
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:48,688
incompatibility in blood transfusions so

45
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:51,599
does it really matter if your a or B

46
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:53,368
blood type or positive or negative not

47
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,379
in your day to day life but if we're

48
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:58,500
looking particularly potentially a

49
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:01,078
blood-borne or blood diseases and blood

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,868
transfusions well now this positive and

51
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,319
negative a and B and O types do become

52
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,429
very important so kind of did you know

53
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,068
your blood type you can kind of compare

54
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,449
here to see where you may fall if you're

55
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,829
part of the majority or the minority

56
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:16,409
here you

57
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,190
the majority no matter what blood type

58
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:22,560
across what race the positive is always

59
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:24,329
a greater number than the negative this

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,310
is because flipping back to the previous

61
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,340
slide you'll notice about 85% the

62
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,400
population does is positive it is

63
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,719
positive for expressing the Rh factor so

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,060
you can kind of pause the video here and

65
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:39,449
take in comparison here and see where

66
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,789
you may fall moving on from the red

67
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:43,319
blood cell type frequency we go to the

68
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:44,669
distribution of those blood types and

69
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,769
again you're welcome to pause the video

70
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,869
here in the slide and take a look at

71
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,540
some of the distributions of either the

72
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,550
a type the B type or the O blood groups

73
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,919
and where they fall where they're

74
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,290
typically found in different regions of

75
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,659
the world and no major advantage to be

76
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:01,739
any one group versus the other but it's

77
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,030
kind of interesting to see how different

78
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,379
subsets of populations do develop now

79
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,390
some it's important a red blood cell

80
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,169
compatibility table so I'll move myself

81
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,849
up here and we're looking our recipients

82
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,129
and our donors and our own negatives or

83
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:19,169
positives or any negatives or a positive

84
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,509
so on and so forth the take-home message

85
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,759
from this is that if you're an a B blood

86
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:25,919
type you're what's called the universal

87
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,229
recipient we're able to basically

88
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,049
receive blood from anyone and we're

89
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:32,759
looking at the positive Rh positive in

90
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,180
this case as you'll notice the Rh

91
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,539
negative

92
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,969
do have some exceptions to this rule but

93
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:41,599
in this case a B+ is a universal

94
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:44,819
recipient they can receive blood from

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,590
anyone what blood type is really sought

96
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,659
after for blood drives in particular or

97
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,479
what's owed blood type particularly own

98
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,819
negative because the dear the universal

99
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,469
donor they can give their blood or

100
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,199
donate their blood to anyone of these

101
00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:00,419
types here so we see that's often called

102
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,879
as the universal recipient but if you

103
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,389
see blood the universal donor able to

104
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,340
give blood Hindu bodies and blood

105
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,079
transfusions so looking specifically at

106
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,209
some examples and how these positive

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,860
natives can impact someone the arch

108
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,199
factors another group of antigens found

109
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,150
on red blood cells over Thersites Rh

110
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,759
positive people have them means they're

111
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,370
positively their Rh negative people

112
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,199
don't have the Rh factor it's a

113
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,000
particularly salient when an Rh negative

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,550
mother gives

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,500
first to an Rh positive baby the mother

116
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,949
baby exposed to fetal blood and thus

117
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,519
produced anti RH antibodies so this is a

118
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:41,639
example here again Rh negative mother

119
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,199
gives birth to an Rh positive baby the

120
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,680
mother can actually develop antibodies

121
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,569
to their own of fetus in subsequent Rh

122
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,000
positive pregnancies so that's second

123
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,519
born this can lead to the eraser of last

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,470
futilities confirm this would be

125
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,569
prevented by injecting the mother with

126
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,910
anti RH antibodies so it is possible

127
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,560
this have to be aware of this they might

128
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,010
be wondering well why or how can a

129
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,290
mother who's Rh negative give birth to a

130
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,689
baby is Rh positive and that comes down

131
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:12,600
to what the blood type the father is you

132
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:15,029
see this indication here and almost I

133
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,200
guess dominant and heterozygous here you

134
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:19,979
can see some of the possible outcomes

135
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:22,110
here if the father is positive and the

136
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,270
mother is negative well that all of the

137
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,980
offspring here will be positive you can

138
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:28,769
see the different combinations here of

139
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,319
what potential their offspring options

140
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:33,449
could be they kind of put this situation

141
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,389
here in a little pictorial form we're

142
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,009
look at this image here and what we see

143
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,079
going on here if you have our Rh

144
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:42,389
positive father an arch negative mother

145
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,579
now the mother here is carrying a fetus

146
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:48,000
that's Rh positive that's because the

147
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:49,800
blood type came from the father antigens

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,870
will develop in the mother and she'll

149
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,319
develop antibodies in response

150
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:57,540
there's fetal Rh positives now this is

151
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,668
crucial for this particularly the second

152
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,990
Ward because she'll come in contact with

153
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:03,539
that blood during delivery

154
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,879
as a result she'll develop antibodies

155
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,470
and what it becomes important is if the

156
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,689
mother becomes pregnant with another

157
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,850
child and that child does happen to be

158
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:13,290
Rh positive well she will now have

159
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,979
antibodies that can cross the placenta

160
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:19,229
and damage the fetal red blood cells in

161
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,909
the unborn baby so this is why it's

162
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:23,129
important to be able to understand blood

163
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,630
types of both mother and father but what

164
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:27,240
the potential would be for the offspring

165
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:29,370
and what order that child is in the risk

166
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,139
factor that may occur again we have ways

167
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,310
