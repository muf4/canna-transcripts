1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
so here we're kind of questions you may

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,919
not have thought of that is how is light

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,449
produced sure you've all seen a rainbow

4
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:11,579
do you know why the colors are organized

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:12,959
the way they are or do you know even

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,879
what generates the colors

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,310
hopefully this lecture will help explain

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,289
a little bit of that just starting first

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,089
with just what is light light does that

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,039
require a medium like sound to travel

11
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,960
one so sound requires air to be able to

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,730
travel through and the air pressure

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,130
differences are perceived by your

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,380
eardrum the speed of light represented

15
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,368
by the letters C famous in the equals

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,359
mc-squared

17
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:38,579
equation is about could say roughly 300

18
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,909
million meters per second in a vacuum or

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,509
that's about 670 point six million miles

20
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,779
per hour

21
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,339
and of light we can only see what's

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,320
called the visible spectrum at a look at

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,789
that little bit to put this into

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,070
perspective the speed of light from the

25
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,629
earth to moon is represented here the

26
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,730
scale models the earth in the moon was a

27
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:59,399
beam of light traveling between it at

28
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,589
the speed of light takes cracklin 1.6

29
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,780
seconds for that beam of light to lead

30
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:10,500
for earth go to the moon we all know a

31
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:12,540
great distance that is so wavelength we

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,310
look at light here consider wavelength

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,368
so wavelengths defined as the distance

34
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,049
between two crests or two troughs so you

35
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,030
see here's a Craster's a crasus should

36
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,009
be considered the wavelength here's a

37
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,019
trough here's a trough here shown here

38
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,349
is a wavelength it's measured in

39
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:31,469
nanometers and and in different

40
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,759
wavelengths equal different colors and

41
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,099
to put this into perspective when we're

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,989
talking about nanometers the human hair

43
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,839
or a single human hair it's about a

44
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:42,359
hundred thousand nanometers we're

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,630
looking here on nanometers in the 400

46
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,978
and 700 range just to eat an idea and we

47
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:48,390
look at the white light passing through

48
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,188
this prism we can see the different

49
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,680
wavelengths we see the red wavelengths

50
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,199
on top here had a much longer wavelength

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,210
and then see down we get to the the

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,689
violets and the blues having a shorter

53
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:03,658
wavelength now I say that can one see

54
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:06,629
the visible spectrum so what is that

55
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,060
spectrum that's visible spectrum is this

56
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:11,340
a very small portion of this entire

57
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,739
electromagnetic spectrum

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,378
sixteen long radio waves microwaves

59
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:19,930
infrared rays and then we're getting

60
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:22,768
smaller and smaller and wavelengths

61
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,959
could see your x-rays gamma rays very

62
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:27,610
damaging very penetrating our visible

63
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,739
light is only this very very small

64
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:33,489
portion here it's expanded in this

65
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:36,908
region here C's 700 nanometers to about

66
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:39,099
400 nanometers is this spectrum or the

67
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:40,598
portion that we can see even though

68
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:43,988
radio H are going through we can't see

69
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:46,089
those microwaves infrared UV light we

70
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:48,370
can't see that can only see this very

71
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:52,299
small portion what we call the visible

72
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,370
spectrum to play this into perspective

73
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,409
moving energy levels who are looking at

74
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,120
the atom again in our energy levels in

75
00:02:56,408 --> 00:03:01,658
order for an electron to move the energy

76
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,730
levels it either needs to gain or give

77
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:05,590
off energy or we can't create or destroy

78
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:09,098
energy that's the only food transferred

79
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,259
the ground state is the lowest energy

80
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:13,539
level is located closest to the nucleus

81
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,459
so now example here this would be the

82
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:18,340
ground state here since our ground state

83
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:21,419
and these energy levels would represent

84
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,919
different levels excited States and

85
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:27,310
increasing energy as we get further away

86
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,169
from the nucleus so absorbing energy

87
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,659
electrons can gain energy from heat

88
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:34,359
electricity or even other light sources

89
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:37,000
when electron gains energy it jumps up

90
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:39,280
in energy levels we see that here here's

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,378
an electron gaining energy jumping up an

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,150
energy level an electron that is gained

93
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:45,878
energy will enter what we call the

94
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,219
excited state then jumped up a level

95
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,509
what kind of electrons can't exist in

96
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:52,739
between they can I exist at different

97
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:56,078
energy levels so here we're gaining

98
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,639
energy jumping up an energy level we

99
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,439
really don't visually see anything

100
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,269
happen when this occurs but that

101
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,419
electron now is what we call the excited

102
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:08,199
state moving on when the electron

103
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:11,409
releases energy their energy released as

104
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,120
it jumps down a level as a photon and it

105
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:15,578
falls down closer to the ground state

106
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,519
the further the electron is from the

107
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,840
nucleus the more energy it has we'll see

108
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,370
that example here where the same

109
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,439
electrons now losing energy it's losing

110
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,790
the same amount of energy but here it's

111
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,509
giving off as a boat

112
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,490
of light which we can see so it's kind

113
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:32,889
of put that in the kind of a motion here

114
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,629
we see an electron here giving off

115
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,240
energy that we can see jumping down in

116
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:39,250
energy level well Shannon gains energy

117
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,689
it jumps up you can see it's moving a

118
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,519
little bit quicker the same thing here

119
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:44,709
it's gaining energy that's called the

120
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,750
excited state and what looses that

121
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:48,489
energy given off photon of light here

122
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,829
down here it's drop into the ground

123
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,689
state

124
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:55,180
so that photon of light each photon

125
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:58,120
matches a distinctive energy level jump

126
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,590
with a specific wavelength emitted so

127
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,110
here's our before out of an excited

128
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:03,639
state during we're dropping down at

129
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,250
energy level giving off that photon of

130
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,959
light in depending on what energy level

131
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,389
or what I'm gonna do the levels it may

132
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,729
jump will depend on the wavelength of

133
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:14,649
light given off so it puts that into an

134
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,600
example here we have an electron to

135
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:19,120
third energy level when I dropped out of

136
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,120
that second energy level it drops down

137
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,800
to that one level there it emits a red

138
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,149
wavelength which is 656 nanometers now

139
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,340
let's take an electron at the fourth

140
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:32,769
energy level and drop it down to the

141
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:35,919
second energy level here and we see that

142
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:38,560
will give off 486 nanometers this kind

143
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,759
of greenish color and for a 5th energy

144
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,939
level we drop that down you see 434

145
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,199
nanometers that purple spectrum now

146
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:49,180
let's make an assumption here for at the

147
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,099
six energy level and drop down we're

148
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,319
gonna be in this range here so we see

149
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,360
there's these different changes in

150
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,670
wavelength and sure enough the part the

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,060
six energy level we dropped down felt

152
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,170
more this purple at 410 millimeters so

153
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,490
you see the different colors are

154
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,439
produced and depending on how the

155
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,970
electrons are jumping around these all

156
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,680
these different colors will blend

157
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,900
together to a single color that will

158
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,879
perceive hopefully this gives you a

159
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:15,299
little bit of a better idea of how light

160
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,300
is produced
