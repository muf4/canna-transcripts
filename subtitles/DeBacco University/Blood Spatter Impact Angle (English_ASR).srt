1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,759
so in this image we see various shapes

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,160
and numbers

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,000
indicating the impact angle and the

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,519
difference that can have on the shape

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,279
so here i'm going to go over the blood

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,880
spatter impact angle

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,119
develop a little better understanding

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,480
and also how to calculate that in some

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,480
examples

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,320
so first off the impact angle is

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,560
important because the blood stain

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,320
pattern study can also support

13
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,919
one determining the truthfulness of

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,039
reports given by the observer

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,960
target or suspect can help support

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,399
a potential explanation or can refute a

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,039
potential explanation for

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,039
what may have occurred at a crime scene

19
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,679
so the angle of impact examples

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,399
here's just some here and we can see

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,799
that

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,960
the 90 degree kind of being that flat

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,878
and we're kind of increasing at 80 70 60

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,480
50 all the way to like 10 degrees

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,640
so with stains that are impacting areas

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,238
between 75 and 90 degrees spines and

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,039
satellite stains occur

28
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,159
all around the stain and however the

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,840
angle of impact

30
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,000
decreases the spines and satellites tend

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,760
to become more prevalent on one side of

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
the same compared to the other

33
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,879
and what we're seeing here in this ins

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,519
is a black and white image but you can

35
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,359
see

36
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,118
this tends to be darker on the lower

37
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,319
side that's the gravitational density at

38
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,040
the lower edge that blood's kind of

39
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,959
forming

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,320
and collecting a little bit more at that

41
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,879
bottom area there

42
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,839
as the angle of impact decreases below

43
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,079
40 degrees

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,680
the steam becomes much more elliptical

45
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,039
and the nature of outflow of the stain

46
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,720
usually produces a single

47
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,118
satellite stain now calculating impact

48
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,359
angle

49
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,478
let's kind of see the basics of it here

50
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,679
you want to identify the width and

51
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,280
length is important

52
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,759
a calculator should be used to calculate

53
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,560
the arc sine now in a circle the width

54
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,920
and the length

55
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,600
a little more arbitrary but here we

56
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,159
could see definitely the length and the

57
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,879
width

58
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,040
definitely are distinctly different it's

59
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,759
width divided by length

60
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,399
and this is the formula so note the

61
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,959
direction

62
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,079
of travel it's a little hard when it's

63
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,879
at 90 degrees

64
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,319
because there is no direction of travel

65
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,039
but it gets a little bit harder as we

66
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,599
you know

67
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,200
looking at an 80 or 70 degree but we

68
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,319
start getting into these you know 10

69
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
20 30 um 40s and 50s degrees you can

70
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,679
definitely see

71
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
getting that elliptical shape this shows

72
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,080
that

73
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,680
the direction of travel so it's going to

74
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,160
impact here and it's going to travel

75
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
in this direction meaning wherever the

76
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,560
tail is located

77
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,520
that is pointing like an arrow with the

78
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,598
direction of

79
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,719
travel there so just kind of a way to

80
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,479
kind of orient yourself

81
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,919
if you're not looking at a broad speed

82
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,519
image you're just looking at an image

83
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,359
you can tell which way the blood was

84
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,959
traveling

85
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
now here are the blood spatter impact

86
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
angle calculation steps the process that

87
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
you want to go through

88
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,598
and again it's the arc sine width

89
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,959
divided by length but you first want to

90
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,159
measure the length and width

91
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,560
of the splatter to divide the width

92
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,439
of the slider by its length so width

93
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,719
over length

94
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,479
and then determine the arc sine of the

95
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,039
number typically using a calculator with

96
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,878
the arc

97
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,079
sine function what you're doing is

98
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,679
you're calculating again

99
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,400
that angle of impact

100
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
so here taking those same steps what

101
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,879
impact angle did this blood droplet hit

102
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,959
and

103
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,959
drop it refer to the one here now

104
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
because it's on a screen you might be

105
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,800
able to tell i've measured it for you

106
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,878
the

107
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
width being 1.5 centimeters and the

108
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,518
length being three

109
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,200
centimeters how do you go about

110
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,840
calculating this

111
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,479
well it'll be the width divided by the

112
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,680
length

113
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,878
and then you take you get that to be 0.5

114
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,480
and then what you're going to do with

115
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,359
that number then is take the arc sine of

116
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,158
that

117
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,879
and you're going to get to be 30 degrees

118
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,359
so this

119
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,560
impacted at a 30 degree angle now if

120
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,440
you're wondering where the arc sign

121
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,719
is on your calculator sometimes it is

122
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,280
referring to that

123
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,799
second function that you need to utilize

124
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,158
so just be aware or learn your

125
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,080
particular calculator

126
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,120
and use this as an example to make sure

127
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,719
you can get the same number

128
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
now a sample data set we're looking at

129
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,598
the distance fall in centimeters versus

130
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,598
volume of different

131
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,878
droppers in millimeters and we could see

132
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,759
the distance fallen 10

133
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,318
25 50 100 centimeters and eyedropper

134
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:04,399
produces 0.032 milliliters

135
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:07,518
pipette 0.045 and medicine dropper 0.53

136
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,840
so the amount of the volume does impact

137
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,680
the generally the size of the droplet

138
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
but if you're keeping the at least that

139
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,439
fairly consistent you can

140
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,719
use it as a source of comparison but

141
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,918
this is just something to keep in mind

142
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,840
when evaluating a

143
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,039
crime scene where you may not know the

144
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,399
volume initially

145
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,759
of blood that fell here's a data set too

146
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,239
finding the angle of impacts that give

147
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,080
you some short axis and long axis

148
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,079
angle of impact on a sketch of the

149
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,959
supplier so how it may look

150
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,399
to try to give you some idea of what

151
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,680
these numbers might equate to or what

152
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,959
they might look like

153
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,840
in an image so with that information

154
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,519
going through now and can you be able to

155
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,959
go through some practice examples

156
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,399
i gave you one but now i'm giving you a

157
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,198
little bit of a data set so give you

158
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,120
five different

159
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,800
blood splatters i want you to find the

160
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,000
angle of impact following the blood

161
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,960
droplet dimensions to give you the

162
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,560
length the width

163
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,879
i want you to determine the angle of

164
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,399
impact measured in degrees

165
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,240
so this would be a great time to pause

166
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,758
the video because my next slide is going

167
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,000
to provide you with the answers

168
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,840
to allow you to check your work

169
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,399
pause the video now hopefully you're

170
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,399
