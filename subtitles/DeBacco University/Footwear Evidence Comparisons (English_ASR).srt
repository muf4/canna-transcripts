1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,360
now here i'm going to go over footwear

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,919
evidence comparisons and

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,480
a pretty good example to show you which

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,558
you may

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,000
you may not catch during the duration of

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,839
this video so you're welcome to pause

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,599
the video or go in the description

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,599
download the slides for yourself and try

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,879
to look at some of the points that i

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,399
bring up because

11
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,559
a lot of this takes just a lot of going

12
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,399
back and forth a lot of time spent to

13
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,079
develop that kind of detailed eye so

14
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,759
what can footwear impressions tell you

15
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,159
well they can actually tell you a lot

16
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,679
they can identify the footwear eliminate

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,920
certain footwear

18
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,679
participant they identify participants

19
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,600
in the suspect in the crime they can

20
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,119
kind of offer locations of impressions

21
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,920
how those might play into what may have

22
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,959
occurred

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,879
rebuttal or confirm confirm alibis link

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,799
suspects determine shoe size

25
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,718
to try to determine number of people

26
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,479
present track kind of see where the

27
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
direction of travel was

28
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,919
so they can actually tell you quite a

29
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,280
bit that's why they're an important

30
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,879
piece of evidence so footwear evidence

31
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,640
kind of these impressions will have kind

32
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,799
of found a great

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,399
example here we're looking at a print

34
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,759
looking at some of the details and kind

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,040
of pointing out some of the key

36
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,280
components to this

37
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,360
particular shoe now it's very important

38
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,760
to kind of orient yourself

39
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,438
have an idea of the size so that when

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,240
you have the actual sample you're able

41
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,279
to go through

42
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,199
and kind of glean all of these wonderful

43
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,640
details and again you're looking at kind

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
of the manufacturer

45
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,879
to just the general size to obviously

46
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,359
looking at just the general tread as

47
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,199
well

48
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,560
so how may that play into certain

49
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,920
aspects when you're making these

50
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,439
comparisons

51
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,719
we also have kind of class

52
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,078
characteristics to look at that's what

53
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,078
you should be looking at first

54
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,239
now keep in mind class characteristics

55
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,438
in general uh there's numerous class

56
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,039
characteristics that's only going to

57
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,000
kind of give you that general

58
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
kind of size tread design things you can

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,719
obviously see

60
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
they're still important they're very

61
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,640
important for potentially of eliminating

62
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,478
certain shoe types we see kind of a

63
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,799
whole bunch listed here

64
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,319
i'll even move myself kind of out of the

65
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
image here so you can kind of

66
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,000
be able to determine and see that kind

67
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,599
of comparison between the two

68
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,078
again these class characteristics can be

69
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,919
simple as manufacturer tread design

70
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,759
and things like that which you wanted to

71
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,039
be able to get to potentially if you

72
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,399
think that you have

73
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,159
things that match on a class

74
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,239
characteristic end you want to get to

75
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,598
the wear characteristics

76
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,599
and this can be getting into more

77
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,039
individual evidence the question shoe

78
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,399
print shows where characteristics that

79
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,959
are similar to that of the known

80
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
shoe very little wear on lateral edges

81
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,439
in the

82
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,800
forefoot section of the shoe print of

83
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,079
the shoe so you're looking at you know

84
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,239
you're having a lot of wear

85
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,840
up here and not so much down here so

86
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
it's getting into wear characteristics

87
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,519
getting into that more individual

88
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,800
characteristics and again as i mentioned

89
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,760
those class characteristics here are

90
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,080
some very specific

91
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,199
ones kind of identified here remember

92
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,280
class characteristics

93
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,878
are distinctive a particular model of

94
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,080
shoe identification of class

95
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,719
characteristics and the footwear

96
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,719
impressions

97
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,719
allow examiners to determine the

98
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,519
manufacturer model sizing of

99
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,318
shoe wear and also the impressions some

100
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,159
class

101
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:57,598
class characteristics present in shoe

102
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,919
above and i've

103
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,878
kind of provided you with some kind of

104
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,039
comparisons

105
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,318
here that you say however when we get

106
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,280
more specific we get into those

107
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,119
individual

108
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,719
characteristics so we're talking about

109
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,239
individual characteristics

110
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,000
we're now looking at characteristics

111
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,759
that are very distinctive to that

112
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
particular show

113
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,799
these consist of random damage on the

114
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,318
outsole

115
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,640
they could cause there's a little piece

116
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,199
of gum attached there's a

117
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,839
crack in one of the areas of the shoe

118
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:28,479
and this is really matching it up to

119
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,000
something that isn't found on all shoes

120
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,840
photograph above there's about 12

121
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,519
individual characteristics here we can

122
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,759
kind of see highlighted

123
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
in that comparison of the actual shoe to

124
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,560
the impression

125
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,039
provided this is why a detailed

126
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,560
impression is so important

127
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,919
here's kind of that last detailed

128
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,479
impression comparison with some kind of

129
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,919
arrows

130
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,840
indicating to allow you to kind of see

131
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,439
kind of where those arrows are pointing

132
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,878
and can kind of pick that piece of

133
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,000
evidence out and can you kind of

134
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,719
identify

135
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,318
those individual characteristics if you

136
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,919
want to kind of do some comparisons you

137
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,359
can go grab one of your own shoes and

138
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,598
see if you can identify

139
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,400
any individual characteristics for your

140
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,000
own shoe

141
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
with this helpful video
