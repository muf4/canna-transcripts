00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,160
going to be going over the container

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,480
types for cannabis production

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,199
we see a couple labeled here shown here

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,160
in the images

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,439
but we're going to go in them in a

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,919
little bit more detail giving you some

8
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,969
of the advantages and disadvantages of

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:22,000
each

00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:24,399
[Music]

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,839
let's get into the video so first off

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,759
the goal of all containers

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,039
is to hold a growing substrate in an

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,118
area where the roots will grow

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,640
and develop the type of container

16
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,600
selected can depend on the growing

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,320
conditions

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,160
and also possible points of transplant

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,079
that's planned as the plant grows

20
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,519
where are you going to move this plant

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,359
potentially going forward

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
that can influence potentially your

23
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,839
decision or allow you to make the best

24
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,718
decision

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,680
to allow an easing of that process now

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,640
starting with the kind of the most

27
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,079
obvious one you're probably most

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
familiar with and that's plastic

29
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
containers the reason why they're

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
probably most familiar or most obvious

31
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,199
is they're cheap they're easy to get and

32
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,399
they come in a variety of sizes all

33
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,000
great advantages

34
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,520
however some of the downfalls can be the

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,478
storage particularly in large scale

36
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,400
production

37
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,079
shipping if you're buying them by the

38
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,560
pallet and then we're looking at just

39
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,118
transporting them to the facility and

40
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,879
also disposal of them

41
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,959
when they're gone through at least one

42
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,719
growth cycle or some are reusing them

43
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,039
uh but disposal when they've kind of

44
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,719
gotten past their shelf life

45
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,720
then we get to air pots which is kind of

46
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,560
like a division of plastic pots to some

47
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,359
extent but we notice that they look very

48
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,159
different

49
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,118
they allow for the air pruning of roots

50
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
so they're kind of

51
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,599
allowing or preventing the roots from

52
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,280
getting pop-bound so allowing air to get

53
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,798
in and kind of self-prune those roots

54
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,320
before they come in contact with the

55
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,399
edge of the container

56
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,639
this increases the root branching and

57
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,799
maximizes the use of container area

58
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,000
with roots however the downfall because

59
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,680
there are little holes

60
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,280
here on the sides as well as underneath

61
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,200
is that they can dry out quicker

62
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,320
and growers may need to adjust their

63
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,040
irrigation frequency and or durations

64
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,478
then we get to fabric containers so for

65
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,719
our fabric containers

66
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,078
they store well in small places they're

67
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,158
very easy to move

68
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,000
they can also increase aeration of the

69
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,640
root zone all great

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,239
positives however the fabric depending

71
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,679
what fabric you get they can break down

72
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,800
over time particularly if used in

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,280
outdoor production

74
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
they also can be hard to clean because

75
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
that fabric tends to bind and hold onto

76
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,280
things

77
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,719
and the bottoms can rot that's the

78
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,000
bottom of the actual pot because it

79
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,000
usually comes down a container because

80
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,520
it comes from kind of with the surface

81
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,199
that's been growing on it can trap a lot

82
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
of moisture in there and as a result it

83
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,039
can cause a rot

84
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
of the container itself then lastly we

85
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,919
get to biodegradable containers and the

86
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,280
advantage is that they're

87
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,039
environmentally friendly

88
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
they can make transplant very easy just

89
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,560
plant the whole pot container

90
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,839
can also minimize the root disturbance

91
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,920
all great benefits

92
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,759
however the time to break down can vary

93
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,958
depending on the type of biodegradable

94
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,560
pot you select

95
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,640
they can dry out faster do the wicking

96
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,000
of moisture and their costs can be

97
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,639
higher than some of the previous

98
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,318
items mentioned so for all of these

99
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,839
container types if there's one you want

100
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:00,318
to learn a little bit more about because

101
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,640
you

102
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,079
like the advantages and can dissuade

103
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,679
some of the disadvantages you're welcome

104
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,239
to check out this channel for more

105
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,879
detail

106
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,878
explaining each of these container types
