1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,388
okay here investigate some of the

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,650
components of growing media and

3
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:07,080
particularly here or a look at the

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,240
inorganic components so if you ever

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,679
looked at growing media the Sun

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,230
contained mixtures of perlite

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,179
vermiculite pumice sand and winning

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,699
agents we're look at each of these in a

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,890
little bit more detail so starting with

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,810
perlite it looks like this it's kind of

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,640
little white particles that are in there

12
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,500
so gives you a size orientation compared

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,240
to a penny and perlite is saying that's

14
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,609
expanded by heat and has ability to hold

15
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,549
water in nutrients while also aerating

16
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,170
the soil it'll float in water so may it

17
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,179
may rise to the surface in the container

18
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,469
especially when you first go to irrigate

19
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,299
something if you irrigate with a lot of

20
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,730
water to kind of moist in the full soil

21
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,619
or a soilless media I should say this

22
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,250
these white particles might float to the

23
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,079
surface

24
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,719
that's the perlite floating to the

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,689
surface the main goal is to increase the

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,160
drainage of the growing media it comes

27
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,979
in different sizes so if you're looking

28
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:59,009
at mixing your own there's fine medium

29
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:01,589
coarse of course being the most common

30
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:04,588
and this is typically implemented in

31
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,540
growing medium not so much propagation

32
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:09,060
medium especially for the course or a

33
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,560
larger particle size there's also

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,530
something called vermiculite and it

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,478
looks like this it's mica that has been

36
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,219
expanded by heat it offers many of the

37
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,140
same big benefits as perlite so does

38
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,150
holding water in air while also

39
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,799
improving the drainage however it can

40
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,290
hold more water than perlite and it's

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,750
more commonly seen in cutting and

42
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,250
propagation mixes there as the same

43
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,259
grading system fine medium and coarse

44
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,420
was fine being used for the propagation

45
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,700
of course being used more for the main

46
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,409
growing situations it's favored in that

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,840
cutting and propagation kind of area

48
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,020
solely because it holds more water and

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,520
moisture retention is a major concern

50
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,399
anything with the propagation

51
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,259
environment I'll Thomas this is a very

52
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,409
light and porous volcanic rock it's

53
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,438
formed when gas rich frothy of glass

54
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:59,969
lava solidifies rapidly so this is kind

55
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:02,218
of that expanded volcanic rock this as a

56
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:04,048
result this is very porous and there's

57
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:06,959
I'll actually float in water even though

58
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,390
it is a rock it's very light something

59
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,878
you may have seen in for example if you

60
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,119
use grills pumice can be involved with

61
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:13,568
that

62
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,670
due to its

63
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:18,908
like structure but extremely light

64
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:21,578
appearance extremely lightweight say

65
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:24,729
simply because of the amount of porosity

66
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:26,890
or air pockets that it has in it then we

67
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:29,169
also have sand this is the exact

68
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:31,268
composition of San varies but it is made

69
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:33,699
from rock and minerals that are finer

70
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,739
than gravel but coarser than silt if you

71
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,619
looking at a gradation the same can be

72
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:41,799
incorporated again to help aerate soil

73
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,019
to help create separation of particles

74
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:45,849
and while its composition may be

75
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:49,450
slightly varied the purpose there is

76
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:51,098
still the same also have the last

77
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:53,289
inorganic component here's wetting

78
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:54,818
agents and these are very important they

79
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:56,560
lower the surface tension of a liquid

80
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:59,469
allowing it to spread out creating a

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,449
water film so if we have no wetting

82
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:03,669
agents we'll just say we have this large

83
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:05,438
water droplet adding with a wetting

84
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:07,930
agents can cause that kind of to form a

85
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:10,719
sheet we see the different comparisons

86
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,389
here of ABC and s the wedding of

87
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,938
different fluids a shows fluid is very

88
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:17,949
little wedding while C shows a fluid

89
00:03:15,938 --> 00:03:21,068
with more wedding see that greater

90
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:22,900
contact surface here C has a small

91
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,848
contact angle and that's allowing it to

92
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,129
spread out and s is kind of that showing

93
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:28,509
that alternate sheet there however the

94
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:30,759
downfall of wetting agents is there is a

95
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:33,009
lifespan which varies to look around

96
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,318
three to six month for long term of

97
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:37,358
wetting agents this is why getting new

98
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:40,000
Australis Vida is advised

99
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:42,250
sometimes the wetting agents can degrade

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,229
over time or if you're reusing media

101
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,090
well it may work out good initially

102
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:48,159
those wetting agents may not be as

103
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,169
effective the second round or the second

104
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,168
time that to use that soilless media
