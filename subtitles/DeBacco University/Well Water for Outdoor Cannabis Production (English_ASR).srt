00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,040
so if you're looking at utilizing well

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,599
water for outdoor

video is for you

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,480
to help you provide some details and

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,480
consideration for this type of water

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,039

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,400
all right let's get into well water for

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,439
outdoor cannabis production

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,719
well first off with any water source you

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,359
want to be sure you're

13
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,118
testing the base water you want to have

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,760
a starting point of exactly

15
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,960
what your water at as a base level what

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,439
you would test for would be parts per

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,640
million

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,558
ec ph and temperature and all these can

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,520
be easily determined with a quality

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,280
water meter

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
however specifics for well water include

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
mineral content for example is it

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,039
particularly hard water

24
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,479
or is it considered to be soft water

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,679
it's important consideration you should

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,000
be making

27
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,119
now with well water we can see a couple

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,840
examples of

29
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,198
wells right here and this is typically

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,520
is required

31
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,119
is a large pump to basically bring the

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,879
water up to the surface

33
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,719
as a result growers want to limit the

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,760
number of cycles which is basically on

35
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,679
off changes with their well pumps it is

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,600
advised to turn that pump on and

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,118
let it run for as long as you need to

38
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,478
and then turn it off and let it sit for

39
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,000
a duration of time

40
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,000
you don't want to just constantly on off

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
on off with the pump when it comes to

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,719
irrigation this means

43
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,720
running it for longer periods of time

44
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,239
and not short durations for example like

45
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,158
a miss system would require

46
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,280
would not be advised for well water now

47
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,040
you could bring that well water open

48
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,719
into a storage tank and pump out of that

49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,079
that could be utilized for the

50
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,359
propagation

51
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,359
misting environment that you might want

52
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,280
to create if there are requirements to

53
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,799
have these kind of short on off cycles

54
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,960
they said using that kind of another

55
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,118
tank is strongly encouraged

56
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,959
because that pump can handle the on off

57
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,560
the well pump should not be utilized for

58
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,319
that purpose

59
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
now with well water we also want to be

60
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,239
mindful of the temperature

61
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,000
in the summer cooler than normal

62
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,798
temperatures might be

63
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,599
advantageous to cool the root zone but

64
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,118
early and

65
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,280
late in the season this cooler

66
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,640
temperature can be a drawback

67
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
particularly involved with the

68
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,359
propagation or early on starting of

69
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,280
seedlings

70
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,959
plumbing water into a holding tank for

71
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,719
natural warming with the sun

72
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,400
is an option for increasing the

73
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,959
temperature of the water before

74
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
is applied to the plants wages typically

75
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,360
depending on the depth of the well

76
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
overall those well water tends to be

77
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
colder

78
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,199
if you're looking at propagation and

79
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,840
germination of seeds or getting clones

80
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,079
to root

81
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,439
that colder water temp could slow down

82
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,760
the metabolic rate

83
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,120
and cause some potential issues versus

84
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,959
just taking that same water

85
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,280
and increasing the temperature to normal

86
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,519
ambient conditions

87
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,479
now well water hard water treatments so

88
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080
if we're looking at well water being

89
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,318
identified it's hard water

90
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,680
a water softening system can be used to

91
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,598
treat that hard water

92
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
water softeners use iron exchange to

93
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,639
replace the hardness or minerals in the

94
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,000
water typically calcium a magnesium ions

95
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,919
with sodium ions to make the water soft

96
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
however this may not be the best option

97
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,439
for cannabis production because the salt

98
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
levels may be too high

99
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,759
requiring additional steps to be

100
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,080
performed when treating the water

101
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,799
so there is a descaler options that are

102
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
used

103
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,439
it uses a magnetic field and does not

104
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,759
use salts as you can see here

105
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,598
scale watcher example looking at

106
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,000
electrical field through that irrigation

107
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,119
water

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,239
to try to accomplish the same basic

109
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,120
end result now scale control

110
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,080
media technology so what is this kind of

111
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,319
all about

112
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
and this is using assault free scale

113
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,759
control media

114
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,959
typically abbreviated scm technology

115
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,199
that's designed to prevent

116
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,319
scale formation and protect plumbing

117
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,919
from corrosion

118
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,560
so not only can it be a benefit to the

119
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:45,119
plants can also be a benefit to your

120
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,360
plumbing and irrigation system overall

121
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,080
this scm technology alters the structure

122
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,080
of the hard

123
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,760
minerals into crystalline structure that

124
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,000
prevents the minerals from binding

125
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,359
and forming kind of a scale buildup

126
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,479
getting a bit like clogging of your

127
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
arteries

128
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,798
unlike salt-based water softeners these

129
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,438
scm technology will not demineralize

130
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,159
your water

131
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,519
nor will add excessive amounts of sodium

132
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,000
to your water system

133
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,599
both advantageous however the ppm may

134
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,199
still be higher than growers would like

135
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,119
so the resulting water should still be

136
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,878
checked because that can affect the

137
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,639
amount of nutrients you're able to add

138
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,120
to that water

139
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,918
now the best system and the vest is

140
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,600
always kind of a relative term here

141
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,680
the best system would be considered a

142
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,759
reverse osmosis system

143
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,360
and this is great for removing minerals

144
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,639
but will often come at the cost of

145
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,560
reduced flow rate

146
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,120
these can be great systems as far as the

147
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,120
end result of watering they produce

148
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,120
but the rate at which they produce it

149
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,439
may not be fast enough

150
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,399
for growers to be able to directly

151
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,319
irrigate

152
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,439
so this means oftentimes the water

153
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,199
generated from these

154
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,199
reverse osmosis systems needs to be

155
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
stored in tanks to be used at higher

156
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,240
volume rates required by most

157
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,159
irrigation methods now just kind of a

158
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,639
word of reason here kind of tossing it

159
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,680
here

160
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,439
at the end is that we have our

161
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,840
if the ppm levels parts per million

162
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,079
levels of the well water are around 200

163
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,758
per million this is not necessarily a

164
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,120
death sentence to your plants

165
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,360
a lot of girls freak out i think they

166
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,800
need to have it below 100

167
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,038
but that's not necessarily always the

168
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,879
case this will restrict the amount of

169
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,879
total nutrients you can add

170
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,800
but in most outdoor settings there will

171
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,478
be natural rainfall at some point

172
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,560
so the hardness of the water again

173
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,240
within reason may not be worth

174
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,360
completely worrying about so that's

175
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
something you need to completely freak

176
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,000
out all the time

177
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,600
however you do want to keep an eye on

178
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,439
the metal parts motors and fittings and

179
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,720
watching out for corrosion

180
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,478
and this kind of gives you just a little

181
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,880
bit of a classification of water

182
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,918
and kind of what the general range is

183
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,800
expected

184
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,839
for that water as far as some of the

185
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,840
mineral components

186
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,839
that you might be getting as a result of

187
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,439
a test just keep mine brine your sea

188
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,000
water brine water scissors your heavily

189
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,918
salted

190
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,360
water and then your fresh water would be

191
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,198
kind of quote your purest

192
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,879
water your drinking water but you could

193
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,759
see slightly brackish can still be

194
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,839
considered

195
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,038
for irrigation purposes this is

196
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,318
particularly important for outdoor

197
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:03,759
irrigation in the sense you're getting

198
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,520
natural rainfall that can help

199
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,280
flush some of those salts out if you're

200
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,799
an indoor grower and utilizing

201
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,799
some of these sources you might want to

202
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,680
have a little lower tolerance levels

203
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,759
because you might be getting that

204
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,280
natural rain to flush any of these

205
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,439
potential components out

206
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,559
so again just keep all of this in mind

207
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,439
and hopefully this

208
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,600
by watching this your plants will

209
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,600
benefit and appreciate from you
