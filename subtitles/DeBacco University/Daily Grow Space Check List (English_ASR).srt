1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,079
this is gonna be a short video here

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,389
because a lot of growers will ask well

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,620
yeah I check my plants every day but

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,800
what should I be looking for

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,379
since the daily grow space checklist and

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,560
something just as a good starting point

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,660
to consider so great slide to print out

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,599
here for just a general idea of what to

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,460
look for in all the various conditions

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,410
one a monitoring is very important so a

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,789
more monitoring everything many

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,920
different aspects to be checking up on

13
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,269
when I operate maximum efficiency when

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,550
everything comes together kind of all

15
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,679
systems go your plan should take off

16
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,359
just like the shuttle here so for air

17
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,850
ventilation and circulation why don't

18
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,100
you all the fans are working are the

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,450
blades and cages clean so initially

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,789
everything starts off nice and clean but

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,350
they tend to accumulate some dust some

22
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,489
other particulates so keep in mind make

23
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,260
sure you're going through and turning

24
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:50,159
them off and inspecting them making sure

25
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,140
everything's clean and working

26
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,718
efficiently humidity is going to change

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,820
based on the stage of the plant but just

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,670
have an idea where the humidity is and

29
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,988
are you in this acceptable range for the

30
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,048
various conditions or the propagation

31
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:06,269
vegetative or flowering phases

32
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:08,868
temperature looking at daily highs

33
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:11,099
between 1775 you can push this to 80

34
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:13,109
going much above 85 though is not

35
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:14,579
advised nighttime tents it's good to

36
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,319
have a little bit of a cool-down sixty

37
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,450
to sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit I also

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,949
put this Celsius here as well so

39
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,170
moisture areas to me the evenly released

40
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,590
across all plants can obtain what media

41
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,299
you use might depend on what your soil

42
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,590
moisture level is and if you're using

43
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,320
clay pebbles you may want to be

44
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,540
irrigating that almost 24/7 800 products

45
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,649
have their own parameters pH for most

46
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,900
grain media we're looking at a goal of

47
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,920
around six point five I'll play a

48
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,600
position as the plants need to be

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,750
rotated the light intensity or they kind

50
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,519
of leaning over to one side in six and

51
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,950
disease inspections check the tops the

52
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,140
bottoms the high low in the canopy it's

53
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,329
also yes you do carry with and just kind

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,790
of do a quick cursory look with a loop

55
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,250
with an LED light just spot any very

56
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,530
small insects or disease spores at the

57
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,000
very early stages nutrients make sure

58
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,590
there's no Ives deficiencies and a

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,019
feeding schedule matches the stage of

60
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,490
the plant a little more nitrogen to

61
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,709
beginning to increase that leaf growth

62
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:08,788
for example check the walls in the floor

63
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,199
make sure everything is clean make sure

64
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,719
all the leaves are swept up

65
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,859
I maintain light distance from the tops

66
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,870
are growing the plants

67
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,280
raising me be required also keep in mind

68
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,620
how old the bulbs may be here are the

69
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,659
reflectors to ensure that you're still

70
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,000
allowing the plants to achieve the

71
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,919
maximum amount of light so yeah and just

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,990
a quick little overview here of all the

73
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,149
things to be looking at and kind of run

74
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,250
a checklist to go through for your gross

75
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,319
space if you're hitting all these and

76
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,409
able to do this on a daily basis you

77
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,139
should be on your way to an efficient

78
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:43,819
and hopefully happy growing space for

79
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,819
your plants and the grower as well
