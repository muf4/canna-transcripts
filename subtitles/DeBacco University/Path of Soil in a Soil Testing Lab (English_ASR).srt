1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,599
ever wonder what soil has to go through

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:05,919
when you drop it off

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,400
until the time you get the results well

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,240
here on this debaco university video i'm

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,789
going to go through the path of soil

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:19,839
in the soil testing lab

7
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:21,439
[Music]

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,439
so here in this video well it is a

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,599
little bit longer it's going to take you

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,879
through step by step the process going

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,879
through a soil lab

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,198
we're fortunate enough to be allowed in

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,079
at the university of connecticut yukon

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,079
soil lab

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,679
and dawn will be our guide here she runs

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,039
the lab and she walks us through the

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,039
entire process

18
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,479
now what's that process going to entail

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,238
well the basic process

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,599
is going to be receiving we start with

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,119
the receiving of the soil

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
where the soil is first processed in the

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,718
lab paper and payment are checked the

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,719
drying of those samples

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,920
so samples are initially dried and while

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,640
growers should not be sending wet

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
samples

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
this allows for consistent moisture

29
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,759
levels of all samples

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
there's a grinding and sifting to occur

31
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,238
which screen is screened out larger

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,160
material

33
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,439
sub sampling is provided to allow a

34
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,438
consistent volume

35
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,438
we're going to see the icp which is the

36
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,158
inductively coupled plasma running

37
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:09,919
machine

38
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
where it has extremely high temperatures

39
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,439
basically hotter than the sun

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,439
to utilize and analyze different

41
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,279
nutrients you can see how

42
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,279
organic matter is calculated with the

43
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,759
loi or loss on ignition

44
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
method where essentially the samples are

45
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,200
burned off

46
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
the organic materials burned off then we

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,840
have the same silt and clay percentages

48
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,200
importance of determining ph phosphorus

49
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,320
run on its own

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,200
analyzer and then the end result or the

51
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,879
report

52
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,118
with some results and kind of some going

53
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,759
through the results with some specific

54
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,359
uh guidance for cannabis so thank you

55
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,560
dawn again at the university of

56
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,078
connecticut lab

57
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,159
i hope you enjoy the video here walking

58
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:55,839
the process the soil takes through a

59
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,840
soil lab

60
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,000
ever wonder what happens to your soil

61
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,118
after you collect it and before you get

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,438
the numbers

63
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,118
today we're going to get to see the soil

64
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:09,919
testing lab here at the university of

65
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:11,759
connecticut

66
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,839
and the exact process that your soil

67
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,439
goes through while your

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,280
lab here is going to be generating the

69
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,280
numbers for you let's go inside

70
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,920
welcome to the yukon soil testing lab in

71
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,120
april

72
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,359
we get we do about 10 000 soil samples a

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,840
year and about 3 000 of them we do in

74
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,400
april so this is our busiest month

75
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,000
um we're going as fast as we can but we

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,280
are limited to how fast

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
us and the equipment can work

78
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,479
so the samples come in any way

79
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
imaginable they come in in little

80
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,119
packages they come in in boxes

81
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,719
what we do is first the thing we do is

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,719
we open up your package

83
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,479
we really really like it when you fill

84
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,680
out our paperwork because it saves us a

85
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,840
lot of time

86
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,040
we're looking for a name address phone

87
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,360
number and email

88
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,039
so we can email you the results we look

89
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,560
to see that you gave us the

90
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,239
right correct amount of money we know

91
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,439
what test you want

92
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,080
we only need a cup of soil for our our

93
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,039
standard nutrient analysis and then we

94
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,000
take the soil

95
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:20,079
we spread it on little pieces of paper

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,318
and we're going to let them dry

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,519
overnight we have fans and we have

98
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:33,839
a heater and we can spread

99
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:33,840
about 300 soils to dry

100
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:40,479
so these are all soils that are drying

101
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:44,719
and then after we finish drying them

102
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,719
the next day we'll start sieving them

103
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,439
there's actually many beautiful colors

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,760
look i like that variable yeah

105
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,438
i like the red this is actually we do

106
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,719
have a lot of red soils in connecticut

107
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,639
people think it's from

108
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,080
uh because they're clay soils we don't

109
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,199
actually have a lot of clay cells in

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,360
connecticut the red

111
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,359
is due to the iron so if you're ever

112
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,280
driving down 84 and you see those red

113
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,640
rocks along the road those are triassic

114
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
red sandstone

115
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,639
and usually the red color denotes a

116
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,480
pretty well aerated soil

117
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,479
it also denotes the soil kind of low in

118
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,919
organic matter because if it had more

119
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,560
organic matter the

120
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,358
organic matter would color up would

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,079
cover up the red color

122
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,758
so after the soil is dry we end up

123
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,478
putting them through a two millimeter

124
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
sieve

125
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,959
so the two millimeter sieve is it is

126
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,960
defines what soil is mineral soil

127
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,079
particles are less than two millimeters

128
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,918
in size

129
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,079
we put them through the sieve and then

130
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,599
we put them in number of cups

131
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,758
and these numbered cups we start with

132
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:47,280
number one and here we are

133
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:49,840
in april and we're up to 2664.

134
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,719
and then we we do have a stamp so we

135
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,638
make sure that

136
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,880
the paperwork is stamped with the same

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,840
number that the soil goes into in the

138
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,839
cup

139
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,759
we dry and sieve the soils and put them

140
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,719
into numbered cups

141
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,560
we need to extract them because we can't

142
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
just take soil and pour it into our

143
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
machines we need to use some sort of a

144
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,319
liquid

145
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,000
everything that we do is like a book

146
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,120
everything goes top to bottom

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,120
left to right the first cup is empty and

148
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,079
that's because it's our truck soil

149
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,519
we have four different chex soils or qcs

150
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,279
quality controls

151
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,639
and we just rotate them they all have

152
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,079
slightly different

153
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,840
phs and amounts of nutrients in it and i

154
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,680
see here that the next textile we would

155
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:38,959
use would be number two

156
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:42,000
so i'm gonna take some out of here

157
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,359
you want to get as level as we can put

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,560
it in our

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,879
little erlenmeyer tap and then we can

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,079
start putting our samples in

161
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,079
so again we'll take a scoopful we'll tap

162
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:58,159
it until it's pretty level

163
00:05:54,079 --> 00:06:00,000
put it in our earl meyer and go on to

164
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,360
the next one

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,399
um so this is what we're trying to do

166
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,960
here

167
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,000
we wanna this is kind of like a little

168
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,000
factory

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,800
we want to make our our end product

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,959
or our our soil extraction we want to

171
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,240
make it so that we can read it on all of

172
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,279
our equipment

173
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,879
and according to the soil test procedure

174
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,198
that we use

175
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,079
which is for a modified morgan we're

176
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,520
taking four

177
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:33,120
cc's this is a four cc scoop

178
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,959
and we're gonna add 20 mils of this

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,759
modified morgan solution

180
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,198
so we're doing a five-time dilution and

181
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,080
the reason why we're doing that is

182
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,759
because

183
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:46,800
about 95 of the samples that we

184
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,000
are analyzing will fall in the standard

185
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,079
curve that we are using

186
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,839
to calibrate the equipment we don't

187
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,719
really want to do more dilutions than we

188
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,478
have to

189
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,319
um and this way anytime you're doing any

190
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,199
kind of analysis you want to make sure

191
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,639
that

192
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,400
what solution you're going to be

193
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,000
analyzing or whatever material you're

194
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,000
going to be analyzing will fall in the

195
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,519
calibration range of the particular

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,519
piece of equipment that you're using

197
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,560
some people give us very tiny amounts of

198
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,598
soil

199
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,959
again we really only need you can see

200
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,279
these are three ounce

201
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,560
drinking cups when we sieve your soil

202
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,318
and we mix them up

203
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,879
this is what we put them into so we do

204
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,639
not need a really large amount of soil

205
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,038
we just really need about a cup of soil

206
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,800
for the standard nutrient analysis

207
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:39,839
now this analysis runs we do the ph

208
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,840
we also do a buffer ph which

209
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,119
is not important to you but it's how we

210
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,799
make our limestone recommendations

211
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,959
and we measure all the major plant

212
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,360
nutrients calcium magnesium

213
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,638
phosphorus potassium but we don't

214
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
measure nitrogen

215
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,720
and we often get people often ask well

216
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,000
how can you make nitrogen

217
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,840
recommendations if you don't

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,759
measure it for one and then they say

219
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,000
well why don't you measure it

220
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,280
we don't measure it because it

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,160
fluctuates so

222
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,159
widely in the soil depending upon

223
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
environmental conditions that

224
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,560
at best would be giving you a snapshot

225
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,400
of how much is in your soil today

226
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,639
and at worst we'd actually be giving you

227
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,198
a um a false number

228
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,280
so we can make nitrogen recommendations

229
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,919
based on field studies

230
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,679
so we know that turf for instance needs

231
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,719
three pounds of nitrogen per

232
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,120
thousand square feet per year first only

233
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,038
need

234
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,839
one pound of nitrogen per thousand

235
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,918
square feet per year

236
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,640
so we measure all the other elements we

237
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,478
measure the trace elements like copper

238
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:45,838
and manganese and boron

239
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,680
and zinc and iron and then we

240
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,480
also do a lead scheme because about 20

241
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,559
of the samples that we get actually have

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,159
elevated lead levels in them

243
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,319
and that's because we're it's a very

244
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,639
very old state connecticut is we've used

245
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,440
lead paint for a long time

246
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,639
a lot of old lead painted buildings they

247
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,320
used to use lead

248
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,080
in the gasoline and let arsenate was

249
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,920
used as a pesticide in

250
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,399
orchards and we had a lot of apple and

251
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,519
pear orchards in the past

252
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,278
so since we're able to add that on when

253
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,240
we measure all the nutrients

254
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:24,080
at no extra cost we figured as a public

255
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,278
service option it's a good thing for us

256
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,160
to be able to offer and so we do do that

257
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,320
so our soils are extracted following the

258
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,399
recommended soil test procedures of the

259
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
northeast united states

260
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,000
if anybody wants to see that it's on the

261
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,679
university of delaware's website we're

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
part of a federal working group and

263
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,359
we've developed methodology

264
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,440
for all of the states in the northeast

265
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,200
as far down as west virginia

266
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,279
so what we're trying to do is we need to

267
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,440
remove from the soil the nutrients that

268
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,159
are available to your plants

269
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,640
and we use something called the modified

270
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,639
morgan extract it was invented by dr

271
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,480
morgan at the connecticut ag experiment

272
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,240
station in the 40s

273
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
and what it does is this extraction

274
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,519
solution it

275
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,720
replicates what a plant is able to take

276
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,679
out of the soil

277
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,440
so what we end up doing is we take four

278
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,439
cc's of the soil

279
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
and we have 20 mils of extracting

280
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,560
solution

281
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,159
and we put them on the shaker for 15

282
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,399
minutes and let them shake

283
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,159
and then we pour through filter paper

284
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,839
and then we get the extracts

285
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,319
and the extracts of what we run in our

286
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,320
equipment

287
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,838
we keep about a thousand soils so we

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,480
just rotate

289
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,440
so if you need an extra test say organic

290
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,200
matter

291
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
you need to call us up pretty quick in

292
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,560
the springtime because

293
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,879
whereas we're running a hundred soils a

294
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,799
day within two weeks time

295
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,159
a thousand soil has already been dumped

296
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,879
you can pull any of those trays out if

297
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,879
you want that's fine

298
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,760
did i hold after we pour our samples

299
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
we wait for all the the extract to go

300
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,799
through and then we're going to get rid

301
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,800
of all the filter papers

302
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,919
and take the funnels off

303
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,439
and then we will wash our funnels out

304
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,838
and we'll have the test tubes filled

305
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,000
with extracts that can be

306
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,480
run on our two pieces of equipment to

307
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,839
give you all of the elements that

308
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839
you need to grow good plants

309
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:45,679
oh let me get our little rack

310
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,600
we write down the numbers of the ones

311
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,120
we're doing

312
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,800
put them in our little rack and bring

313
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,799
them into the other room so we can put

314
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:58,319
them on the analyzer

315
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,958
extracted and they're in these little

316
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
test tubes we get a clear extract if we

317
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,759
don't have a clear extract then we

318
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,879
re-filter them

319
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,600
and we're going to run them on two

320
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,039
different types of analytical equipment

321
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,278
we're going to run it on a discrete

322
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,240
analyzer to measure ortho phosphate and

323
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,958
then we're going to measure

324
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,240
or put it on an icp to measure all the

325
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,679
other elements

326
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,440
so i can't fit these test tubes on the

327
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,159
discrete analyzer so what i'm going to

328
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,720
do is i'm going to pour a little bit

329
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,719
in each of these cute little

330
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,879
containers and put them in this wrap

331
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:38,679
[Applause]

332
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,679
and then we'll set them up to run

333
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,679
orthophosphate

334
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,000
you know you can see our samples aren't

335
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,039
really very large that we end up with

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,799
so it's really important that whoever's

337
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,039
taking the soil sample

338
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,159
do a good job in taking a representative

339
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,919
sample

340
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,439
so that the small amount that we

341
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,000
actually pull out of the sample

342
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,959
is a good average of what you actually

343
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,759
have in your soil

344
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,799
so here we're using about five about

345
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:23,120
five mils maybe a little bit less

346
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:25,599
and then once we get them all poured

347
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,919
into these little sample cups we're

348
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,120
going to take the whole little rack

349
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,559
and we're going to put it in our

350
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
discrete analyzer here

351
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,440
so in there we have we have different

352
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,720
reagents

353
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,880
we have our matrix and we have

354
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,560
a high standard and this high standard

355
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,399
will get diluted

356
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,000
and put into these six little cups and

357
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:54,639
that's how we make our standard curve

358
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,919
so this is a this is a discrete analyzer

359
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,480
it measures basically absorption so what

360
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,679
happens

361
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,440
is the sample probe

362
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,359
picks up some of the sample and some of

363
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,360
the reagent and it puts it in little

364
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,879
cuvettes and the cuvettes are kept in

365
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,480
here

366
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,078
and these little and they put in these

367
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,920
little cuvettes

368
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,198
and these little cuvettes they incubate

369
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,838
they're on a heated tray

370
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,919
and they incubate and what happens is

371
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
with the reagent the more phosphorus

372
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,159
that's in the soil

373
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,000
the darker the color blue it is so what

374
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,919
this machine is doing is it's looking at

375
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,958
how much light is absorbed

376
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:34,479
so say for instance you had a

377
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:36,479
clear you had a cup full of clear

378
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,350
kool-aid and then or clear water and

379
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,440
then you had

380
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:42,560
[Music]

381
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
and then you had maybe a another glass

382
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,239
full of blue kool-aid although

383
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,198
this is not kool-aid and if you've shown

384
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,839
a light through

385
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,679
the clear water you'd be able to see

386
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,160
almost all the light that goes through

387
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,159
it

388
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,519
if you're shown a light through your

389
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,439
blue solution

390
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,959
only some of the light would get through

391
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,720
the rest would get absorbed

392
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,239
so what that's what this machine does it

393
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,839
measures the amount of light

394
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,278
that's absorbed and the more light

395
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,560
that's absorbed

396
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,278
the higher concentration of phosphorus

397
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:14,638
so we're going to tell this to start and

398
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,639
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

399
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,680
first i'm going to tell it what

400
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,519
method to use so we're going to use

401
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,679
ortho phosphate method

402
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,679
and then i need to tell it

403
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:36,319
how many samples i have 48 plus i have a

404
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:40,720
lcs elise control standard and i have to

405
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,320
tell the first number we're on

406
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,639
and then i'll say okay load these

407
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,879
samples up

408
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,399
so then it's going to load them all up

409
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,120
and i'm just going to change the last

410
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,519
one to

411
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,639
lcs and then i'm going to ask it to save

412
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,120
it

413
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,120
to save it what do i want to call it we

414
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,720
typically just call it by

415
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:08,720
the date so and then this is the first

416
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:10,959
set of the day so it's going to be a

417
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,278
all right so now i'm going to call it up

418
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,758
i'm going to go into my

419
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:15,759
system

420
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,440
and you can see this is where i loaded

421
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,078
all the samples this is my lcs

422
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,680
these are my reagents that's my matrix

423
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,519
that's my high standard and that's where

424
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,838
it's going to make the other standards

425
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,278
so i'm going to tell this to run i'm

426
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,920
going to want it to do a

427
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,600
water blank it's going to calibrate

428
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,159
press the little button

429
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,920
and in about two hours worth of time i

430
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:51,838
should be able to get all my phosphorous

431
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:51,838
numbers off of this

432
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,000
it's actually making the standards now

433
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,919
so we took some

434
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,600
took some reagent and took some standard

435
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,719
and put in those little cups and kind of

436
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,920
mix it up

437
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,439
and eventually we'll get a curve we can

438
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:09,119
look at the curve

439
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,120
i hope it's like 0.999

440
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,269
[Music]

441
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,600
it picks up a little bit of all the

442
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,038
reagents and picks up a little bit of

443
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,480
whatever sample it wants and then it

444
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,679
puts it in the keypad that's what it's

445
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,439
doing now

446
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:31,038
and it rinses itself off in the well

447
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,038
and it goes get some more reagent

448
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,798
goes through that rinse process brings

449
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,160
it up

450
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,079
you know it's exactly what it's supposed

451
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,759
to do it knows

452
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,439
you program into how much of each of

453
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,440
these reagents put in

454
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,038
the key is when you're programming this

455
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,798
is that you have to make sure

456
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,839
you're not telling it to put more liquid

457
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,839
in that can be held in that

458
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,879
so little one of the coolest things

459
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,119
about this machine is that

460
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,039
you just put in one high standard that

461
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,159
makes all the standards so it makes the

462
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,240
curve for you

463
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,840
do our best to educate them on they want

464
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,839
you want your news

465
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,479
yeah this is what the results look like

466
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,079
so this is reading this reads the

467
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,038
optical density

468
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,519
which is remember i said that you have

469
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,798
it's

470
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,279
it's adding reagents that turn it bluer

471
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:47,440
the more

472
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,599
phosphorus so it would be more dense the

473
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,600
more bluer it is so the higher optical

474
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,959
density and it translate that into the

475
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,038
concentration

476
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,798
that's how much we know how much

477
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,798
phosphorus is in your soil sample

478
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,960
you notice that some of that this isn't

479
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,798
really great but you notice some of them

480
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,240
are a little bit darker than others

481
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,599
typically the ones that are a little bit

482
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
darker than others have a little bit

483
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,839
higher

484
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,839
organic matter concentration in them

485
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,440
what's really cool is to look at the

486
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,319
saturated media ones because some of

487
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,000
them come out like

488
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:25,599
copper blue or blue green

489
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,319
i'm going to grab this and put this on

490
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,319
the icp

491
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,839
yes these are all our standards

492
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,439
so we end up we we use standards to

493
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,360
calibrate

494
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,558
and these are known amounts and then we

495
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,000
have another

496
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:55,119
lease control standard and

497
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,720
um for all the elements in except for a

498
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,439
sulfur and then we have a separate one

499
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,440
for sulfur

500
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:08,240
so every time we run we calibrate

501
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,239
and then we run a known qc with the set

502
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,439
technical difficulties here and then we

503
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,279
run

504
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,279
known qcs with the calibration

505
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:25,759
so this is our icp that stands for

506
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,120
um inductively coupled argon plasma

507
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,079
spectrometer

508
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,519
it's run on plasma a plasma is actually

509
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,918
a fourth state of matter

510
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,839
there's solids there's gas there's

511
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,440
liquids and there's plasma

512
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:41,279
this is so hot this is 6000 degrees

513
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,320
centigrade it's actually hotter than the

514
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,279
sun

515
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,399
and the thing that's neat about this is

516
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,599
we're able to run

517
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,960
this is this is a atomic emission

518
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,759
so i don't know if you remember back

519
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,480
from chemistry but every single atom has

520
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,400
a

521
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,558
nucleus and around the nucleus it has

522
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,798
the electrons that are traveling

523
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,200
this is so hot that what this does is

524
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:06,079
the the

525
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,360
machine the sampling will pick up some

526
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,839
of your sample

527
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,119
it will put it into the spray chamber

528
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,639
the spray chamber

529
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,719
and there's a little nebulizer there

530
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,679
breaks it all up and some of those

531
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,558
spray from your sample that we poured

532
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,200
goes into the

533
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:23,918
plasma and so what happens is the plasma

534
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,200
is so hot it excites those electrons

535
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,960
and it causes them to raise up out of

536
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,279
their characteristic ground

537
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,079
state orbital and so when it when they

538
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,480
do they're just doing that for a brief

539
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,399
period of time and they fall back down

540
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,960
and when they fall back down

541
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,640
we have an optical system in here and we

542
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,759
set it on different wavelengths

543
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,679
and we've told the we told the machine

544
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,079
what wavelengths to use so when we're

545
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,080
running

546
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,000
we'll be running um potassium at 766 and

547
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,839
calcium at 183

548
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,480
and phosphorus at 177. so it's looking

549
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,279
for

550
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,360
those wavelengths and it measures the

551
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,200
intensity of the wavelength and the

552
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,479
intensity of the wave proportion to the

553
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,720
concentration of the element

554
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,000
when we're standardizing with the icp

555
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,240
we're actually measuring

556
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,319
counts per second that's what cps stands

557
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,519
for and what we want to do is we want to

558
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,439
see is the standards

559
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,558
as it takes up more and more standards

560
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,000
we want to see the numbers

561
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:27,839
increasing and then we know we have a

562
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,839
nice linear fit

563
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,759
so we have crucibles and the crucibles

564
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,038
we get a weight on them

565
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,359
we put some soil in the crucible we let

566
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:47,599
it

567
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,359
sit in the oven at 105 degrees

568
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,599
centigrade for two hours

569
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,759
and we take it out we re-weigh it so we

570
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,279
now we have an oven dried weight

571
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:59,038
and then we put it in our furnace and

572
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:02,240
our furnace goes up to 375 degrees

573
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,599
centigrade so and then at after we put

574
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,038
it in the furnace

575
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,719
it has to be in there for a minimum of

576
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,240
two hours but we usually end up leaving

577
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,038
it longer because we just run out of

578
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
time

579
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,599
and we'll take it out and get a

580
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,640
measurement of it so we don't want to

581
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,158
touch these

582
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,759
until we get a measurement of it because

583
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,640
we could have grease or something on our

584
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,798
hands

585
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,080
so put it on our little we check to see

586
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,359
there's a number on the bottom of the

587
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,960
crucible

588
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:27,918
we put it on our scale and

589
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,919
then we can measure

590
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,280
there we go sorry i can't see and we can

591
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,319
measure how many grams is in there so

592
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,319
this would be

593
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,319
25.745

594
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:53,278
then i'll write that down in my

595
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,200
and then we just end up using a so we

596
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,200
have a weight we have we know what the

597
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
crucible weighs we have a weight of the

598
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,720
soil before it goes into the furnace

599
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,880
a weight of the soil when it comes out

600
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,558
after furnace and then we can calculate

601
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,559
out what the actual percent of organic

602
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,720
matter is

603
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,038
and and again this is an extra test well

604
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,480
it's just seven dollars and

605
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,400
some people like to know how much

606
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,400
organic matter is in their soil

607
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,919
they might ideally you'd want to keep it

608
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,880
somewhere between four and eight percent

609
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,880
for most crops

610
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,319
this is number 23. put 23 on there

611
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,798
i'm gonna put a little dot so they'll

612
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,798
get lost

613
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,839
and

614
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:52,960
so this would be 30.77

615
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,959
all right 30 points yeah 30.773

616
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,360
and then we actually have a we can

617
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,399
calculate this out using a handheld

618
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,119
calculator

619
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,559
or we have a we actually have a little

620
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,839
program in our computer where we just

621
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,720
put these weights in and it just

622
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,720
automatically does it

623
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,558
because we also measure the soil ph and

624
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,159
the ph is a very important um

625
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:17,599
variable it's actually the master

626
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,080
variable the

627
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,439
soil ph affects the availability of all

628
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,000
plant nutrients

629
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,278
so what we end up doing is we mix um a

630
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,359
scoop of soil

631
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:31,839
with a scoop of with five ml of water

632
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,639
we let it equilibrate for about half an

633
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,918
hour

634
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,759
and then we run it on our ph meter

635
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,000
and um so we get we get the initial ph

636
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,200
once we get that after all the phs are

637
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,798
done

638
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,640
this tells us what the soil ph is at now

639
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,359
but it doesn't necessarily give us an

640
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,600
indication of how much limestone to add

641
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,519
so after all the phs are run we add a

642
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,000
chemical buffer we're using the modified

643
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,038
melee

644
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,278
puffer and we add that to the soil and

645
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,519
water slurry that we've already created

646
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:06,159
and then we re-read the buffer phs and

647
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,440
if you know what the buffer ph is

648
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,400
when you think about it what is the

649
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,120
buffering capacity of the soil

650
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,320
it's the soil's ability to resist change

651
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,158
and what affects that

652
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,678
how much organic matter and how much

653
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,039
clay is in the soil

654
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,360
so we we use a modified

655
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,079
maelic buffer and we know that it's at a

656
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,479
ph of 6.6 and we see how far down it

657
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,158
takes that 6.6 if it takes it down a lot

658
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,000
it's a well-buffered soil

659
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,760
if it doesn't hardly take it down at all

660
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,440
it's a poorly buffered soil

661
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,200
so if you have a poorly buffered soil

662
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,558
and you're trying to change the ph

663
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,319
you would not need to add as much

664
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,119
limestone to it as if you had a well

665
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,119
buffered soil

666
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,880
some people want to know how much sand

667
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,720
silt and clay is in the soil

668
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,720
and if they do that it's an extra test

669
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,558
it's a mechanical analysis or still

670
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,319
textural analysis

671
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:59,759
and what we end up doing is we take some

672
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,960
soil we put it in

673
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,679
a blender cup with some

674
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,000
sodium oxalate and some water and we put

675
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,679
it on

676
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,919
our milkshake machine and we let it um

677
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,960
mix for about 10 minutes and then we

678
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,960
pour it into these

679
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,798
boyuca cylinders and we fill it to a

680
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,640
particular volume

681
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,480
and then we need to take readings and

682
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,600
and these this basically works like

683
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,399
stokes law

684
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,359
so heavy particles settle faster so what

685
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:27,278
we would do is we

686
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,798
use this little stirring rod to stir it

687
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,919
all up

688
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,759
and we would stir it up very good

689
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,759
and then we will take our little

690
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,798
stirring rod out

691
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:42,960
and we'll put in a hydrometer

692
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,960
and then we take a reading at 40 seconds

693
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,360
and then we'll after we take the reading

694
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,519
we'll take a temperature

695
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,119
and then what we'll do is we will take

696
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,879
another reading at two hours

697
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,558
and through the process of subtraction

698
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,240
we're able to tell you how much sand

699
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,240
salt and clay is in the soil

700
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,798
so we'll take our little reading our

701
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:07,038
reading now is about

702
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,079
14 and in units that would be grams per

703
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,038
liter

704
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,759
so then the cylinder can come out it

705
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,200
would set the timer for two hours

706
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,759
and then we didn't need a temperature

707
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,640
because it's all temperature based

708
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,319
so we put our little our little

709
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,600
thermometer in there

710
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:28,398
it's real and then it just takes 10

711
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,359
15 seconds we see that it's about 20

712
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:31,759
degrees

713
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,918
and then we can calculate out how much

714
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,720
sand silt and clay is in the

715
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,399
sample so that that is an extra test an

716
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,798
extra charge for an extra test

717
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,319
and we need a little bit more soil so

718
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,079
instead of sending in one cup you would

719
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,599
send in two cups

720
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,199
then we would set our timer for two

721
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,519
hours and we'll come back and we'll read

722
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,798
it

723
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,879
another reading in two hours but you can

724
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,519
see how this is graduated so

725
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,039
at the bottom of the heavier particles

726
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,639
this was sitting for a little bit this

727
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,480
hasn't been stirred and you can see that

728
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,799
the particles are starting to settle so

729
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,880
that's how this

730
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,200
works with the boyuca cylinders and with

731
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,320
the hydrometer heavier particles settle

732
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,880
faster

733
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,359
and and as they settle they change the

734
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,799
amount of particulate matter that's in

735
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,000
solution and that's the reading that

736
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,759
we're actually taking with the

737
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,519
hydrometer because

738
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:23,278
the hydrometer measures in grams of soil

739
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:27,839
per liter so you can see these little

740
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,839
measurements are grams of soil per liter

741
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,200
it's kind of cool

742
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,600
so once we know what your ph is and we

743
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,360
know what the different nutrient values

744
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,959
are and we know who you are

745
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,278
we're able to put this all into the

746
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,120
computer and produce a soil test result

747
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,278
which we send to the client

748
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,879
we like to send it via email so we ask

749
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,480
that people please share with us their

750
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,559
email address

751
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,240
what you'll notice is we do we do test

752
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,720
the four major

753
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,798
macro elements and then these numbers

754
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,079
don't necessarily mean very much to a

755
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,398
person

756
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:04,000
we think of them more as like an index

757
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:04,479
but what you want to do is you want to

758
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,440
note

759
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,240
where where which column your results

760
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,840
fall in

761
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,759
your goal is actually to get everything

762
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,519
in the optimum so

763
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,599
we know what values would be below

764
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,839
optimum what would be optimum what would

765
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,839
be

766
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,918
above optimum and in the case of

767
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,319
phosphorus what would be excessive

768
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,080
so since the numbers aren't always clear

769
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,678
to what people mean we have these little

770
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,278
bar graphs and they put them into the

771
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,360
various columns

772
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:31,839
and then we'll tell you what the ph is

773
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,639
don't worry about what the

774
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,798
buffer ph is we use that to make

775
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,600
limestone recommendations we also can do

776
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,759
an estimated cation exchange capacity

777
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,519
if it's somewhere around 10 that means

778
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,519
you have a soil that has

779
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,558
a fair amount of either clay and organic

780
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,038
matter in it

781
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,240
and it can hold on to nutrient cations

782
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,200
so a

783
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,319
cation let me go back an ion is a

784
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,558
charged particle

785
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,759
a cation is a positively charged

786
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:01,599
particle

787
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:04,398
your soil has the same same

788
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,719
materials that cause it to have a good

789
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,839
buffering capacity the clay and organic

790
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,839
matter are also

791
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,839
responsible for holding on to the the

792
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,558
cations or the nutrients

793
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,319
and so we give people a rough estimate

794
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:17,278
some people ask for organic matter it's

795
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,720
an extra test

796
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,398
again if you're somewhere between four

797
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,360
and eight percent it's great for most

798
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:22,959
crops

799
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,959
we have a few organic growers that

800
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,120
really like to

801
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,960
modify how much calcium magnesium

802
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,798
potassium that they have

803
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,240
according to the base saturation so

804
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,319
while this doesn't mean

805
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,159
that much to many people some people

806
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,240
feel that it's important

807
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,840
and then we're able to analyze a bunch

808
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,919
of trace elements

809
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,000
and there isn't any recommendations for

810
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,000
trace elements the only thing we have in

811
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,159
connecticut is because the soils are low

812
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,398
in boron you could we can make

813
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,200
recommendations for alfalfa or for

814
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,879
commercial apple trees otherwise what

815
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,880
we've done is we took a thousand soils

816
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,480
and we came up with a typical range

817
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,159
and we're telling you to just use it as

818
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,480
a diagnostic tool

819
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,679
if it's really excessive that means

820
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,440
something's probably not

821
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,519
quite right with the soil somehow it was

822
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,519
contaminated with that particular trace

823
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,440
element

824
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,200
and if your ph is where it's supposed to

825
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,480
be and the organic matter is where we're

826
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,798
supposed to be you should have

827
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,000
good enough amounts of trace elements in

828
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,759
your soil

829
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,919
and then we we need you to tell us what

830
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,200
you're growing we have over 100 crops to

831
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,720
choose from

832
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,038
we'll make limestone and fertilizer

833
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,640
recommendations according to the crop

834
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,879
and we'll tell you it will tell you what

835
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,759
the target ph is for the particular crop

836
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,519
you're growing

837
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,278
and if you need to add limestone how

838
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,798
much and then if you're a

839
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,319
commercial grower we would give you

840
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,960
pounds of nitrogen phosphorus and

841
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:43,038
potassium to add

842
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,079
if you were a homeowner we have a

843
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:48,079
tendency to make recommendations for a

844
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,278
fertilizer you could purchase like a 5

845
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,639
10 10

846
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,519
or 24 4 3 or something along those lines

847
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,519
but for

848
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,960
most of the the agronomic crops and the

849
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,640
commercial fruit and commercial

850
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,038
vegetable crops we just give you pounds

851
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,360
of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium per

852
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,119
acre

853
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,879
and then we give you some references so

854
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,359
every every

855
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,840
sample that we send out you'll get a

856
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,359
link to our general interpretation sheet

857
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,519
and that basically tells you what we

858
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,119
test for and why and then we give you

859
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,798
specific references so if you're

860
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,398
growing lawns we give you a lawn one if

861
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:21,440
you're a vegetable grower we give you a

862
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,239
vegetable one

863
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,159
for hemp growers there isn't anybody in

864
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,839
connecticut that's doing research on

865
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,159
fertility levels

866
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,918
right now in connecticut so but there

867
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,080
are in several other new england states

868
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:39,840
so we've given you links to their hemp

869
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:39,839
information on their website
