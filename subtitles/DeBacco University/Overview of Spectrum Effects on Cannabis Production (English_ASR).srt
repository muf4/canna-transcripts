1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
here on this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,120
we're looking at the overview of

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,810
spectrum effects

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,980
on cannabis production

5
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:09,980
[Music]

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,679
so here we're going to take a look at

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,679
some of the different spectrums and some

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,358
of the effects they have on plants

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,800
so first off should start with a general

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,800
summary and this provides a quick

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,080
visual and textual summary of the major

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,039
classifications of the different

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,959
spectrums

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,720
in addition to the main impact on the

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,239
plant is also provided

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,000
meaning when we look at uv light that

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,558
can slow growth and enhance oil

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,719
production

19
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,399
in relation to cannabis for blue light

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,920
they can reduce cell expansion and cause

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,759
plants to be shorter

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,679
green light does penetrate leaves and

23
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,640
does facilitate human vision in

24
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,439
diagnosis

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,120
of different plant diseases or potential

26
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,878
nutrient deficiencies

27
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,399
red light is very efficient for the

28
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,238
photosynthetic process

29
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,879
and far red light can enhance cell

30
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,959
expansion and cause plants to stretch

31
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,640
so if you give plants blue and far red

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,399
you kind of have some competingness

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,400
there one wants it to keep straight

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,519
keep stretch one wants it to keep it

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,478
short and stocky

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,240
so again the amount and kind of

37
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,359
proportions of these you give a plant

38
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,118
can impact its morphological outcome

39
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,879
so looking at just the general mickey

40
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,400
curve here

41
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,039
so the mcki curve was developed in the

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,280
late 1960s to early 1970s it was an

43
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,240
attempt to understand how plants utilize

44
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,079
light interpret this with caution as the

45
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,118
study was done with multiple points

46
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,719
in time data points that was put into a

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:33,599
curve of a graph so kind of like a bunch

48
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,759
of little points

49
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,438
that kind of made into a graph plants

50
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,118
can adjust to their environments and

51
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,279
plants will make the most of the light

52
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,040
available to them which may result in

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,040
changes in their morphology

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,200
so just again keep that also in mind

55
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,920
that this is just a suggested curve and

56
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,040
gives you just an

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,560
idea of how plants may utilize the light

58
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880
spectrum

59
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
looking specifically at some details

60
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,438
within this

61
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,600
looking at the uv light so starting at

62
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,319
that kind of 100 to 400

63
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,158
nanometer are the basics of uv light uv

64
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,359
radiation spectrum is divided into three

65
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,159
regions called uva

66
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,878
uvb and uvc as sunlight passes through

67
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,079
the atmosphere

68
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,079
all of the uvc in most of the uv uvb

69
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,920
is absorbed by the ozone water vapor

70
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
oxygen in carbon dioxide

71
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,799
meaning plants will be exposed to it

72
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,719
less than if they were say growing

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
outside of earth say the international

74
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,439
space station uva is not filtered

75
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,439
as significantly by the atmosphere so

76
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,280
it's able to penetrate and reach the

77
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,719
surface of earth to a little bit higher

78
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
degree the uv

79
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,560
region covers the wavelengths range from

80
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,080
100 to 400 nanometers and is divided

81
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,519
into those three bands

82
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,640
uva being 315 to 400 nanometers uvb

83
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,800
280 to 315 uvc 100 to 280 nanometers

84
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,039
the relatively long wavelength uva

85
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,239
accounts for approximately 95 percent of

86
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,479
the uv radiation

87
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,640
reaching earth's surface just to put

88
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,039
that in perspective there

89
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,158
with increasing altitude and there's

90
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,039
less atmosphere

91
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,759
is available to absorb uv radiation so

92
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,479
with every 1000 meters in altitude

93
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,120
uv levels increase by approximately 10

94
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,280
percent

95
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
just showing you the impact elevation or

96
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,759
distance from sea level

97
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,039
can have now uv implants response so

98
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,759
let's relate this now to back to the

99
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,158
plants

100
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,759
uv light response in plants is similar

101
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,759
to blue light meaning uv

102
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,158
does not drive photosynthesis and can

103
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,199
also trigger cannabinoid synthesis

104
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,798
and potentially reduce disease uv light

105
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,518
does cause some stress to the plants so

106
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,360
they may develop

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,120
thicker leaves and or protective

108
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,760
compounds as we see here

109
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,519
in the plant pictured with pigmentation

110
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,199
such as anthocyanins that purple

111
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,920
coloration some plants would do this

112
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,439
naturally

113
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,839
but if we're seeing that that is a

114
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,519
response usually to some sort of stress

115
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,158
in this case it could be a light stress

116
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,280
from uv

117
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,798
light here's a new look at some old data

118
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,560
so this is kind of interesting

119
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,120
research kind of i came across and some

120
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,840
inter interpretation of that research

121
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
so dr bugbee's lab in utah state

122
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,598
university

123
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,318
investigated physics kenneth mckee's

124
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,158
data from the 1970s in relative

125
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,759
photosynthetic efficiency

126
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,759
looking at the data the error bars

127
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,359
represent a range of plant species

128
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,840
from the paper showing small variations

129
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,680
among species when grown in the field

130
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,358
the growth chamber of plants indicated

131
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
larger variability and we kind of see

132
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,638
that here with the lines

133
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,759
kind of being a little bit larger on

134
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,680
here in the growth chamber a little bit

135
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,680
smaller overall in the field

136
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,280
the question is is it possible that

137
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,160
field grown plants the ones here at the

138
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,399
top

139
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,080
have synthesized compounds to block uv

140
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,879
for the protection of light reducing the

141
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,879
effectiveness

142
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,159
of those wavelengths and we're seeing

143
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,240
that here's our line

144
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,759
here's our uv radiation we're seeing in

145
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,560
the field less

146
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,840
a much reduced kind of amount of

147
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
relative quantum yield

148
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:48,560
and in the growth chamber yes the

149
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,319
variability is greater but we're seeing

150
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,839
an increase in that curve

151
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,839
is it possible because of the high

152
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,599
intensity of lights that the

153
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,719
field grown crops have to deal with are

154
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
they producing compounds that are

155
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,240
blocking out some of that uv

156
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,000
light to help protect them from

157
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
potential damaging effects

158
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,759
so just kind of a unique look at some

159
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,758
older data

160
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,520
now those blue photons as i mentioned

161
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,360
before blue photons

162
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,879
reduce cell expansion so it's going to

163
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,240
tend to keep plants a little bit shorter

164
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,560
and a little bit stockier

165
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,160
blue photons as a result keep the plants

166
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,360
shorter reduce leaf expansion here's

167
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,439
five percent blue is 20

168
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,520
but we see that plant is definitely

169
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,279
stockier shorter internodes

170
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,560
this morphology difference in cannabis

171
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,719
plants grown under five percent blue

172
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
versus 20 blue light we do see

173
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,840
pretty evident they are just on the

174
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,600
picture um the reduction in plant height

175
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,159
then we get into talking about green

176
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,680
light so while plants are green

177
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,199
indicating that the green wavelengths

178
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,000
are reflected by the plants this does

179
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,840
not mean

180
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,038
these are wasted wavelengths a lot of

181
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,638
people think oh why should i give them

182
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,319
green light it's just a waste

183
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,000
really that's not the case green

184
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,439
wavelengths of light penetrate deep into

185
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,399
the leaf and are absorbed by certain

186
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,478
plant pigments

187
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,399
which are of benefit to the plant

188
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,079
chlorophyll may have reduced absorbance

189
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,560
of green wavelengths but this is not the

190
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,639
only plant pigment so keep that in mind

191
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,240
there's other plant compounds in the

192
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,079
plant than just chlorophyll

193
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,840
we see that particularly in areas that

194
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,839
have deciduous trees that change color

195
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,198
as the fall time approaches we see an

196
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,239
expression of those pigments

197
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,319
when chlorophyll is degraded now green

198
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,639
photons in plant diagnosis

199
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
so green photons as part of white light

200
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,160
allows growers to see the plants and

201
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,000
better diagnose potential problems

202
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,680
it is much easier here to look at the

203
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
plants under this kind of full spectrum

204
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,639
light

205
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,240
than this high par purpley light to

206
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,000
diagnose for diseases look for

207
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
potentially nutrient deficiencies

208
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,519
and that's really important to catch

209
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,038
things early so while the plants may

210
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,120
grow well under both

211
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,318
this white light would be better to be

212
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,079
able for the grower

213
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,600
to diagnose plant problems at a much

214
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,279
earlier stage when it's easier to

215
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,160
control them

216
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,519
so red photons again in the 640 to 700

217
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
nanometer wavelength

218
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,719
and plant response what's kind of

219
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,680
looking like with these different

220
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,360
wavelengths

221
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,199
well red leds are among the most

222
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,080
efficient at converting electricity into

223
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,720
photosynthetic

224
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,318
photons and are relatively inexpensive

225
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,599
this is why you typically see a lot of

226
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,280
red leds chlorophyll strongly absorbs

227
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,719
red light in this it's effective at

228
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,519
photosynthesis

229
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,560
great benefit there many plants grow

230
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,478
under only red light

231
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,959
no blue will have a stretch tall

232
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,360
appearance thin large

233
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,120
leaves so keep that in mind that just

234
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,319
because it's a great light to

235
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,840
what looks like would be a good plant

236
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,720
response it's going to cause plants to

237
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,119
kind of stretch

238
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,759
kind of exaggerated tall appearance

239
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,598
leaves might be large it could be thin

240
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,800
that could cause some issues there so

241
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:34,639
this is why we want to give plants kind

242
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,199
of a mixed light this is a reason why we

243
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,439
see a lot of

244
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,000
red light given to plants in growth

245
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,439
chambers and indoor grows in general

246
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,038
then we talk about something here called

247
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,240
the far red

248
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,159
wavelength so a little different than

249
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,038
just red we're now in that far red

250
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,879
which is 700 to 800 nanometers far red

251
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,038
light is in a range of light that

252
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,960
the extreme red end of the visual

253
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,240
spectrum just before you get to the

254
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,079
infrared light

255
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
usually regarded as a region between 700

256
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,318
and 800 nanometers in wavelengths

257
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,439
it is dimly visible to human eyes so

258
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,598
keep that in mind that

259
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,839
we're kind of pushing the edge there of

260
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,360
the visible spectrum

261
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,038
far red and plant response vital plants

262
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
respond to far red light

263
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,639
well far red is critical spectrum for

264
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,639
plants that's utilized in the

265
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,840
photosynthetic process and can cause an

266
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
impact on plants

267
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,758
shape far red is also perceived by

268
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,000
plants photoreceptor

269
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,360
the phytochrome which is important for

270
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,759
light detection

271
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
and also timing and flowering in some

272
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,360
plants

273
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,918
so that far red kind of drives the pr to

274
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
the pfr the active to inactive farm

275
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,598
you can force the plant from the active

276
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,240
to inactive form quicker

277
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,120
with the addition of far red light we

278
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,440
see here the

279
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
regular plant and then plant grown with

280
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,399
far red how it

281
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,159
definitely increases the height the

282
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,120
internet spacing and the stretching

283
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,519
of that plant now we talked earlier

284
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,278
about

285
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,720
light penetration we'll notice the

286
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,559
difference across the different colors

287
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
of how light penetrates into the leaf

288
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,838
for blue we're looking at light absorbed

289
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,600
in the top layer

290
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,839
for green the light penetrates deep into

291
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
the leaf red kind of similar to the blue

292
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,480
and with light only being absorbed in

293
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,640
that kind of top layer

294
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,800
but then that important far red is also

295
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,958
penetrating deep into the leaf as well

296
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,079
that's just important consideration when

297
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,958
we're looking at how these

298
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,480
how these wavelengths might be utilized

299
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,919
by the plant

300
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,080
so that blue versus far red wavelength

301
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,159
so far red will enhance cell expansion

302
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
which is essentially the opposite of

303
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,519
blue photons they kind of like

304
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,278
play off one another plants grown

305
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,000
indoors with eighty to ninety percent

306
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,240
red light

307
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and ten to twenty percent blue light are

308
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,278
quite compact with small leaves and

309
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,278
shorter stems

310
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,278
we see the white versus far red which is

311
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,439
plus ten percent far red here

312
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,480
it's very important with lettuce and

313
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,880
with other plants

314
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,039
it will cause plants to grow very tall

315
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,000
want to be mindful of you know how tall

316
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,399
we're letting our plants

317
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,759
get how leggy we might be getting them

318
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,360
looking at our seedlings we're looking

319
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,278
at shipping ceilings we want to

320
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,560
grow these large top heavy seedlings

321
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,559
they may break during

322
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,000
transportation with the lettuce here

323
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,958
we're seeing our white versus our adding

324
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,559
our 10

325
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,799
can definitely increase that leaf

326
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,518
surface area and that's typically what's

327
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,958
being bought

328
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,560
and purchased because you're looking at

329
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,159
the salad production

330
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,000
so that can really help increase

331
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,600
production per plant there by increasing

332
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
that amount of surface area

333
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,278
this shows seedlings grown at 68 degrees

334
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,560
fahrenheit for four weeks under leds for

335
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,519
18 hours a day

336
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,000
at 160 micro moles per meter squared per

337
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,200
second

338
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,799
consisting of 100 red and 50 blue 50

339
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,399
red you can see how that morphology

340
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,399
difference is quite staggering with the

341
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,240
red being much taller and the

342
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,679
mix even mix of blue and red being much

343
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
shorter

344
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,120
so that quick general summary of

345
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,920
everything i kind of mentioned here

346
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,679
photon color blue green red and far red

347
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,759
and look at the impact on the plant blue

348
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,879
photons inhibit cell expansion keep them

349
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,720
short and squatty

350
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,879
green photons aid with human vision to

351
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
be able to diagnose plants visually for

352
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,879
nutrients or potential disease issues

353
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,078
red photons are very efficient at

354
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,039
photosynthesis

355
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,719
far red photons increase cell expansion

356
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,919
now if you want to learn more this is of

357
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,519
interest to you

358
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,759
to learn a little bit more about this i

359
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,240
would direct you to researching some of

360
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,200
these scientists here to provide you

361
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,759
with some

362
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,120
more information they have a great and

363
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,439
lots of work out there

364
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
so by all means take a look search

365
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,920
search them up where you can learn a

366
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,600
little bit more

367
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:23,679
about the impact of photons and

368
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,680
wavelengths on plant production
