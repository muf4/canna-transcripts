1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
interested in learning more about super

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,080
cropping your cannabis plants

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,599
well this debacle university video will

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,519
give you some details

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:17,920
if you're looking at learning more about

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:17,920
this pruning method

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,399
let's get into super cropping pruning

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,559
method for cannabis production

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,239
so first off the quick and simple of it

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,079
well super cropping can be quick and

11
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,959
simple way to prune trained

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,000
plants to run if they run out of height

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,120
in the growing space

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,200
so it's kind of like when you're getting

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,039
that area getting too close to the area

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,760
the roof or the ceiling limited or

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,920
lights

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,599
you can super crop them it's a technique

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
where you're bending the stem close to a

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,359
90 degree angle that involves breaking

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,239
the internal fibers of the plant in the

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,200
process

23
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,078
but not breaking the entire top off this

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,760
can be done

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,840
in flour although it's usually performed

26
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,000
in the vegetative stage of growth

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,600
now when i say this kind of bending here

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,759
looks pretty aggressive and it is

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,039
but we're not breaking this it's not

30
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,039
completely falling off

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,478
this top part will continue to be able

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,079
to grow

33
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,280
now because of that because you don't

34
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,039
want to break that plant off you have to

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,118
learn the feel of the plant

36
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,080
squeezing pinching the stem where you

37
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,359
want to bend it

38
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,879
you will feel the plant's tissue start

39
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,000
to crush a little bit you can kind of

40
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,519
see right here

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,359
and then you want to lay the upper part

42
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,200
of the branch over at a right angle

43
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,400
and that goal is to crush but not break

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,799
the plant tissue

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
do not perform this on the top two to

46
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,240
three nodes as you want to be sure that

47
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
there is some plant material above

48
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,199
to crush the plant if you do it when

49
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,319
it's too young you won't have any of

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,719
those really kind of developed

51
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,559
fibers with thinner or woodier stems

52
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,118
that are harder to crush

53
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,560
but it is possible if they're um get a

54
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,000
little bit more of that technique and it

55
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,920
just comes with some feel

56
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,519
this stem eventually will form a callus

57
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,759
or kind of swell

58
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,798
at that bending point after a period of

59
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,118
time

60
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,640
now the advantages of super cropping why

61
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,040
would someone want to be implementing

62
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,959
this

63
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,719
well the most obvious reason is to keep

64
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,280
the plant canopy at the same

65
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,640
level especially in height limited

66
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,640
growing operations

67
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,200
the bending of the main stem will also

68
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,879
increase light exposure to lower buds

69
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
which can help increase the number of

70
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,120
larger buds the plant produces

71
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,639
all of these are good things and this is

72
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,080
where that timing comes in and learning

73
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,919
your particular strain

74
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
note that does not work well plants have

75
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,318
been aggressively lollipopped as well

76
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,159
so you can sometimes combine pruning

77
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,919
methods if you're super cropping

78
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,680
and lollipopping those two are really

79
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,119
kind of a little bit more of a conflict

80
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
to one another

81
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,959
however super cropping can help maximize

82
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,319
the horizontal space in the growing area

83
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,479
and fill in empty gaps

84
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,560
both between plants and also in the

85
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,679
within the same plant we talk about

86
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,920
having multiple tops

87
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879
this is just one example here of a plant

88
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,598
that counted uh

89
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,239
59 different uh tops there from a single

90
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,079
plant

91
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,599
so again a great method to kind of

92
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,879
implement there we can just see how many

93
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,679
tops we can get

94
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,039
from one plant now when do you actually

95
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,080
super crop when's the kind of the

96
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,799
perfect timing

97
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,239
what's typically performed in early

98
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
flower or so

99
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,599
as this can increase the size of the bud

100
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,519
in the end branches

101
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,199
and also lower buds that will now be

102
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,920
getting greater light intensity

103
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,119
some do it in late veg some early flower

104
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,439
again it's not like a set

105
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
day the general recommendation though is

106
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,719
about three to

107
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,959
three to seven days a week before

108
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,239
growers decide to flip that photo period

109
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,479
to help allow plants sometimes to

110
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,840
recover from the stress of this method

111
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,359
before they go into flower

112
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,479
so some girls will do it right after

113
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,519
they float in the flower to give a

114
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,878
little time to adjust

115
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,039
other girls like to do it just before

116
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,840
they flip in the flower to allow some of

117
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,158
that longer

118
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,598
photo period to penetrate the canopy and

119
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:36,479
encourage those buds to start

120
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,000
forming now the basic process super

121
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,679
cropping is to make room for

122
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,919
more super cropping and some examples

123
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,879
here it can be done multiple times

124
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,359
this example here the branches bent that

125
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,359
has

126
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,280
no lower branches growing up so here we

127
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,640
have initial bending point here

128
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,479
what does that allow when we take that

129
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,359
wrench and bend it this way now

130
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,199
this makes room now for this branch now

131
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,319
be bent going this way to fill in that

132
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,000
empty space

133
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,839
this allows for a different branch that

134
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
does not have lower branches to be moved

135
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,319
into this

136
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,680
area and this is how you can really

137
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,039
maximize production

138
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,879
looking at your plant and kind of like

139
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,878
okay if i take this one i kind of bend

140
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,239
this one outward going this way now

141
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,518
well that gives me an empty space here

142
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,799
that maybe i take when it's over here

143
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,199
and kind of bend it that way

144
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,040
you're starting to maximize that canopy

145
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,400
from still a single plant

146
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,400
particularly important if you're ceiling

147
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,799
height limited or also if you're plant

148
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,198
number

149
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
limited now what's happening when you're

150
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
super cropping you know there's a plant

151
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,319
hormone shift that's occurring

152
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,319
and the bending of the plant does not

153
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,959
remove the apical portion we still see

154
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,879
that here

155
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,478
of the plant but it does increase the

156
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,360
light intensity to the

157
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,039
inner and also the lower leaves this can

158
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
help induce further development of these

159
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,879
lower portions of the plant

160
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,000
without this pruning without this the

161
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,680
pruning style

162
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,120
in this areas these leaves would be

163
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,879
shaded so we're

164
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,160
maximizing the light penetration we're

165
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,439
maximizing the coverage

166
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,160
area we're really allowing the plants

167
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,240
to perform and to produce the highest

168
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,080
percentage or greatest efficiency

169
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,600
that we can and this is why growers like

170
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,599
to utilize this pruning method
