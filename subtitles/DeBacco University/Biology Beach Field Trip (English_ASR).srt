1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,980
here I'm going to go over some details

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,200
about the biology field trip to human

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,970
asset beach we were some of the basic

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,019
structure of the field trip and also

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,138
some questions you should be asking

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,509
yourself and looking at answering coming

7
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,099
away from this field trip so the first

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,390
part is it is human asset State Park

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,949
this is the address we're gonna be

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,589
parking in the main parking lot here

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,539
walking down this large walkway to the

12
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,910
main pavilion and continuing out from

13
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,500
there in a state park is connect its

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,149
largest shoreline park with over two

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,099
miles of beach to enjoy it won't be

16
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,289
visiting all of it will be focusing

17
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,808
mainly from here starting working to

18
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,929
sand dunes and working basically over to

19
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:42,659
this area here in the loop region first

20
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:45,030
opened the public in July 18th 1920

21
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,619
juice is an army reservation and the

22
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,079
federal government during World War two

23
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,689
so it does have some store reference and

24
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,780
over 1 million people visit every year

25
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:57,329
so hopefully we can enjoy it and be able

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,679
to understand some of the impacts of

27
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,350
this area we're just that volume of

28
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,359
people that visit the area so just some

29
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,840
quick words of caution just to consider

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,710
please carry out what you carry in

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,978
regardless of what that is related to

32
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:12,629
food or anything else to chew brain be

33
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:14,489
respectful of others in the environment

34
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:17,429
there may be other school groups there

35
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,839
even amongst your own students and other

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,299
individuals from the public that may be

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,460
there so just keeping a watch out for

38
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,470
everyone in our group and also other

39
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:26,969
groups lastly just make sure you watch

40
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:28,739
out for poison ivy tried to point it out

41
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,599
here typically we'll have green leaves

42
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,879
but when it first comes out it may have

43
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,618
this kind of reddish tones here and at

44
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,228
some anthocyanin that's produced in the

45
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,640
least helps protect it from the Sun

46
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:40,319
helps shade it there a little bit so

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,228
again not something want to be touching

48
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,599
as it can cause of severe itching this

49
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:48,179
an allergic reaction now getting to the

50
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,339
key ideas of the field trip to keep in

51
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,049
mind you want to be considerate of how

52
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,570
the individual species in ecosystem

53
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,540
respond as the oceans become more acidic

54
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:00,419
sadly a trend that we are noticing here

55
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,000
with some general global data to a why

56
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,490
will rising water temperature impact the

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,259
beach and how will that affect and what

58
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:09,000
will affect how our native invasive

59
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,639
species interacting with one another can

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,860
you find any of native or invasives

61
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,869
what's the role at each speech

62
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,480
environment play in the carbon cycle

63
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,180
it's in the general theory looking at

64
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,659
and also what can we do to help mitigate

65
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,469
negative impacts so general organization

66
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,759
I'm going to go through these in a

67
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:28,409
little bit more detail this gives you

68
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,599
just an idea when we say beach just

69
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,009
think of sand there are some rocky areas

70
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,379
there are some areas that I don't have

71
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,539
trees and there's trails revisiting a

72
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:38,939
little bit of each of these major

73
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,759
different areas so these are some of the

74
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,550
key questions to ask sand dunes art and

75
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,649
science water testing plants animals in

76
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,050
salt marshes there's going to give you a

77
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,520
quick overview of these stations here so

78
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,170
for the sand dunes the importance of

79
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,510
sand dunes well how does sandins impact

80
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,059
the local environment can you define for

81
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:59,429
unique niches found within the zones of

82
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,750
the sandy beach area and what's the

83
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,360
connection between the sand dunes and

84
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,219
hurricanes how do they protect the beach

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,560
how could they they become damaged how

86
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,080
could that be a threat things again

87
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,930
three key questions to consider when

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,730
looking at sand dunes moving on to blend

89
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,890
art and science well how does art and

90
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:18,209
science fuse together and what made you

91
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,219
select a story or drawing that you

92
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,799
created at this station so does have

93
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:24,479
some supporting reasons for that water

94
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,159
testing station you could can identify

95
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,379
the type of the tests that were

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,909
performed what the word the results

97
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:32,009
found or what was the data provided to

98
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,959
you it has this provided information in

99
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:35,250
the area that cannot simply be seen in

100
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,259
an image because I have a picture here

101
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,509
of the water is that human s a beach

102
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,579
what is the data say what is the result

103
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:43,590
of the testing some key points to

104
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,360
remember remember the pH scale 7 is

105
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,909
neutral under 7 is considered as sick

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,150
over 7 is considered basic on our chart

107
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,759
0 to 14 is the scale albro and tile blue

108
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,000
solution may have uses in a lab of

109
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,340
looking at respiration rate is a pH

110
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,019
indicator and carbon activated in water

111
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,400
will result in carbonic acid formation

112
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,200
reducing the pH plants living at the

113
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,090
beach what are some plants that are able

114
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,889
to survive in the beach environment if

115
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,450
you're walking on a trail look for tag

116
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:14,279
number four next to a large rock and a

117
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:17,039
bench what are there different colored

118
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,358
algae we can see here a rock with some

119
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,459
greens and brown why are there's

120
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,108
different colors what do they exist and

121
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,060
you say the question a plant at the

122
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,370
beach may have genetics to grow ten feet

123
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,600
tall but at maturity the phenotypes only

124
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,100
three feet tall

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,210
what stresses may be on the plants that

126
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,280
does not reach its full genetic

127
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:34,169
potential so be thinking and considering

128
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,059
that question then we go into the animal

129
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,439
hunt at the water's edge and if you pit

130
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,269
in my classroom you might recognize this

131
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,189
image it is on the wall I want to

132
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:42,930
consider what animals can you find how's

133
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:45,600
the tide impact your ability to find

134
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,740
animals and what are tides how does its

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,830
implication affect the shells and

136
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,750
skeletons of sea life a good link you

137
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:53,609
might want to look at here can you fully

138
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,740
classify one in while starting with the

139
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,470
domain the kingdom then go into phylum

140
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,879
class order family genus and species for

141
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,470
just one of the animals that you are

142
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,990
where someone is able to find at the

143
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,000
beach the value of salt marshes why are

144
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,500
salt marsh is important if we do not

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,300
have salt marshes what would be the

146
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,430
native impacts in the local ecosystem

147
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,590
from a bird's perspective then I at

148
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,900
least four reasons why salt marshes are

149
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:18,869
important and here's again images from

150
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,129
him an acid pH again those resounding

151
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,629
questions we want to be thinking about

152
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:24,209
how old individual species and

153
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,959
ecosystems respond as the oceans become

154
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:27,359
more acidic

155
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,279
what is ocean acidification why is this

156
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,840
happening what are some ways individual

157
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,329
species might respond to ocean

158
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,759
acidification how will the lowering of

159
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:38,159
oceans waters pH impact the ability of

160
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,170
ocean to store carbon in deep sea

161
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,120
sediments what can be done to reduce

162
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,560
this change and things we want to be

163
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,129
considering as overarching themes

164
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,600
amongst all stations in addition while

165
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,909
rising water temperature impact the

166
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,170
beach how this impact current species in

167
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,630
place and the potential spread of

168
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,250
invasive species what impacts is warm or

169
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:58,050
surface temperature have on ocean storms

170
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,879
what can be done to reduce the negative

171
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,230
impacts and again a good link here and

172
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,290
some data provided with you on this

173
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,900
slide also how we how our native

174
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,300
invasive species interacting how isn't

175
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,859
invasive species defined what can be the

176
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,569
long-term impacts of invasive species

177
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,370
what are some examples of native

178
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,829
invasive species found at the beach

179
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,860
again a great link here to the

180
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:21,479
Connecticut website the role of species

181
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,340
environment play in the carbon cycle so

182
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,620
it can give you a brief overview here of

183
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,629
the carbon cycle the cycling carbon

184
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,910
involves a few different forms of carbon

185
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:31,379
however what roles chrome dioxide play

186
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,300
in the carbon cycle so look at that

187
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:34,439
molecule it has that interact with

188
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,600
plants and animals

189
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,730
what role do plants animals play in this

190
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,140
cycle as well as well as human impacts

191
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,150
and results of fossil fuel-burning

192
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,560
unless we wanted to kind of end this on

193
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,539
a positive note what can we do to help

194
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,639
now when we look in the mirror we'd be

195
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,230
proud what are some activities that can

196
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,779
contribute to the simplification of

197
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,250
oceans we want to be mindful of that and

198
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,949
what actions can we do to reduce the

199
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,990
negative impacts on the environment some

200
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,579
good information provided here and very

201
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,139
lastly in no particular order some

202
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:04,149
quality resources that might help you

203
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,740
address some of these questions and also

204
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:07,779
provide some great background on the

205
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,449
beach so again this kind of that

206
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:12,399
overview of the biology field trip to

207
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,959
him an asset beach in the description

208
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,029
there is the link to all the images that

209
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,979
are used as well as the slides if you

210
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:19,750
wanted to print those out hope you have

211
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,120
a fun time and are able to learn

212
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,870
something and make a connection to the

213
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,870
study of life
