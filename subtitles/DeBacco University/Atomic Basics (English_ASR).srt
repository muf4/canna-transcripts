1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,359
okay here we're a look at the atomic

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,519
basics and how they relate to biology so

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,539
we think atomic we think basics here

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,460
maybe first wondering that our biology

5
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,980
and this is like chemistry connected

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,570
well we're kind of borrowing along lines

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,118
of what we call biochemistry

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,550
since biology is a multidisciplinary

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,640
science living organisms are subject to

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,099
basic laws of physics and also chemistry

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,050
so in this particular lecture learned

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,750
about a little bit into the very small

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,579
end of chemistry these activities is

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,950
sustain life in depend on the properties

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,320
and properties of atoms and molecules in

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,399
a compound and if we don't understand

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,070
kind of what's going on at the very

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,700
small level it and realized how it can

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,259
impact us on the very large scale so

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,480
first off the atoms were they made out

21
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,308
of what we can see here in the center

22
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,738
nucleus we have our protons and our

23
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:58,468
neutrons and our electrons are on the

24
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,988
outside see the same thing here with our

25
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:06,030
protons and neutrons on the inside and

26
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:08,009
our electrons around that nucleus so

27
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,000
organisms are composed of matter so if

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,130
you guys should probably find what

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,069
matter is well matter is anything that

30
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,109
takes up space and has mass so it could

31
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:18,000
be this rock could be the plants could

32
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,129
be the building could be this bird could

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,549
be the tree that this bird is on all

34
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:27,839
these are composed of matter because

35
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,159
they take up space and they have mass so

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,600
properties of matter well there's

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,368
physical properties which are based on

38
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,859
observations that do not alter the

39
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,328
composition of the matter so when we're

40
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,219
looking at properties or measuring

41
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,589
properties of matter two of those that

42
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,209
we can do would be mass well it's a

43
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,969
property of matter that measures its

44
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:47,569
resistance to acceleration or a general

45
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:50,039
measure of the number of atoms present

46
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:51,719
another physical property regarding

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,490
matter would be volume and this the

48
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,519
amount of space and object takes up

49
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:59,298
measured in cubic units so we think

50
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,739
about mass here and just basically the

51
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:05,219
measure of the number of atoms present

52
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:10,378
and volume is the space then object will

53
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:11,789
take up density is a measure of mass per

54
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,829
volume so how do we kind of relate those

55
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,019
to be dense and we see here

56
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,300
this graduated cylinder different

57
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,920
liquids of different densities those

58
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,630
that are more dense will be located on

59
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,879
the bottom and as it are less dense will

60
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,590
be more on the top when we say less

61
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,379
dense as molecules are spaced out

62
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:33,569
greater when we say more dense there is

63
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:35,310
more mass per volume the basic atoms we

64
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,560
mentioned before here's our protons and

65
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,479
neutrons will hit in the nucleus and our

66
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,670
electrons on the outside but this image

67
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,909
adds that the others did not is that the

68
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:47,639
protons have a positive charge neutrons

69
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:51,479
are neutral and electrons have a

70
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,619
negative charge atoms are the smallest

71
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,359
unit of matter

72
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,980
the average made of these protons that

73
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,200
are positive charge indeed also

74
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,869
determine the atomic number and

75
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,219
therefore the element so why not

76
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,280
determine the element we look at the

77
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:06,990
proton number neutrons simply have a

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,719
neutral charge and are located in the

79
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,600
nucleus electrons have a negative one

80
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,009
charge encircle the nucleus typically we

81
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,379
will see them kind of labeled like this

82
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:18,689
with neutrons with zero here indicating

83
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,219
a neutral charge electrons at the e with

84
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,050
the minus sign and getting a negative

85
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:24,719
charge in protons with the plus

86
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,400
indicating a positive one charge an

87
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,129
excellent table to kind of go over

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,080
review and commit to memory be this one

89
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,909
right here it gives you the particle

90
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,160
name electrons protons and neutrons

91
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,199
their location whether it's in the

92
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,930
orbitals on the outside or located in

93
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,149
the nucleus and the charge where

94
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,000
electrons and negative one protons

95
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,030
positive one neutrons are neutral or no

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,789
charge and the mass protons and neutrons

97
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,849
have a mass of one and electrons you say

98
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:55,859
about zero say about zero because for

99
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,780
the tension purposes of this class we're

100
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,480
going to consider it to be zero but

101
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,739
there is a very very small mass there so

102
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,979
it's why it's about there it's a very

103
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,509
small minut number for our easy math

104
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,439
calculations we'll pretty much consider

105
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:12,539
a mass of zero now the atomic number

106
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,639
atomic mass atoms of various elements

107
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:17,159
differ in the subatomic particles and

108
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,219
Owen's atomic number is the number of

109
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,770
protons so here we see magnesium as 12

110
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,140
protons every oxygen atom will have

111
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,789
eight protons and here hydrogen will

112
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:31,269
have an atomic number of one

113
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,770
it has one proton in its nucleus the

114
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,120
numbers below here we see our average

115
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:40,359
atomic weights which we'll talk about

116
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:43,660
later the elements atomic mass number is

117
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,210
the sum of protons plus neutrons in the

118
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,970
nucleus so in furniture a Tomic weight

119
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:51,699
we're adding up the protons in the

120
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,820
neutrons since they accompany the vast

121
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,319
majority of the mass of the atom now

122
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,180
it's an average atomic weight which I'll

123
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,329
talk about in other lectures that's why

124
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,259
you get into these decimal points and

125
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:03,759
international atomic weights here for

126
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,750
all the elements you can find those

127
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,189
easily on the periodic table of elements

128
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,310
so the atomic number and the atomic mass

129
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:16,240
the atomic or mass number is the sum of

130
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:18,069
protons and neutrons and down here we

131
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,470
see the atomic number which is the

132
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:23,379
protons in a neutral atom this is the

133
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,210
same as a number of electrons so the

134
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:27,639
proton number will not change for helium

135
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:30,639
but when we say it's a neutral atom of

136
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,039
helium two of those protons we know are

137
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,569
present therefore we need two electrons

138
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,140
with their negative charge to balance

139
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:40,810
out the positive charge atoms of two

140
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,550
regions the electron cloud which takes

141
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,399
up the most space and is an area where

142
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,920
electrons circle the nucleus that is the

143
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:50,319
outside portion here here the neutrons

144
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,290
are made the nucleus is made of protons

145
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,089
and neutrons and determines the atomic

146
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,010
mass and that's the center region here

147
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:59,019
sees a large positive charge because

148
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:01,779
remember our neutrons also located in

149
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:03,849
the nucleus have a neutral charge this

150
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,379
electron cloud often confuses students

151
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,350
kind of like was it takes up the space

152
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:10,569
and atoms circling the nucleus it's kind

153
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,600
of like this example here the electrons

154
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:14,889
here are the birds and the person here

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,050
in the center is represent the nucleus

156
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,289
and the electrons kind of like the birds

157
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,790
are kind of center around this nucleus

158
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,790
most of those birds will be found around

159
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,680
that person or representing the nucleus

160
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,960
but they'll always be a few here to the

161
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,850
outside kind of looking at a density

162
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,519
standpoint we see a more dense located

163
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,310
here and less dense to the outside this

164
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,019
way we call this an electron cloud

165
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,280
there's not really particularly set

166
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:41,049
orbitals it's

167
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,059
this cloud region it kind of see this

168
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,040
darker shading or more dense located

169
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,769
around the nucleus and less dense around

170
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,120
the outside

171
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:50,918
lastly elements that matter is made up

172
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,160
of elements and an element is a

173
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:56,199
substance that cannot be broken down to

174
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,870
other substances by chemical reactions

175
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,639
so we see here just generic elements all

176
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:04,090
listed here being behind and broken

177
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,970
apart the most basic unit here is our

178
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:09,459
elements and we refer to a study more

179
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,680
the periodic table of elements but

180
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:14,969
hopefully this gives you just a general

181
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,970
basic overview of atoms
