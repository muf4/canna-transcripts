1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,689
irrigating and watering plants is an

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:08,160
essential part of growing but properly

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,138
monitoring plant moisture and knowing

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,900
and maintaining proper plant ministry is

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:15,388
very important and many growers will

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,789
miss this either over or under watering

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,500
so proper plant moisture want to be in

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,529
that you know ideal range don't want to

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,118
be too high or too low rare cases on

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,789
both ends typically I find a little bit

11
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:27,868
more common as the over watering so over

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,539
watering well what's the problem with

13
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,768
over watering often growers just love

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,050
their plants too much when they go there

15
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:35,399
if you need to do something so often

16
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,439
they feel like well plants need water so

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,270
the water it's kind of like filling a

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,640
cup of water then just keep the faucet

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,300
running - can cause it's wasting water

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,009
from one can also cause roots to rot

21
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:48,808
that's can be in very great negative

22
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,878
that can occur from this over irrigating

23
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,859
reduces oxygen content in the root zone

24
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,899
we see the extreme example here of trees

25
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,339
growing in pond here looks like it may

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,189
have been flooded and we see that

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,379
they're unable to survive so this is a

28
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,988
many of the negatives associated with

29
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,609
over watering plants be careful on what

30
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,530
media you're using because that can

31
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:08,879
dictate and help regulate how much water

32
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,950
you need to add and if you're changing

33
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,289
media's you need to change your watering

34
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,329
regimen now if you're under watering

35
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,830
plants this can cause plant stresses it

36
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:19,650
can be difficult to read wet the solar

37
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,298
of media once some media dries as better

38
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,460
if it's peat moss base to become

39
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,950
hydrophobic and really hard to re-wet

40
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:27,569
this is where if you forget about the

41
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,799
plants or a pump fails and you go back

42
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:32,728
to reward can be a very difficult

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,229
process to initially rewetting will dry

44
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:36,900
out sometimes and this is a high clay

45
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,209
and crack above media if it's contains

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,280
in particular peat moss or clay pebbles

47
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,199
that can be another challenge to get

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,570
that to re-wet back to its original

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,219
condition so of course your goal is to

50
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,078
have the correct amount when I provide

51
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,090
plants with the moisture they need allow

52
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,648
Reed's to grow and breathe keep in mind

53
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,689
that this amount that you're providing

54
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,750
them to have the correct amount could

55
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,849
change over the growth of the plant and

56
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,129
when that plant is small it's going to

57
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,379
require less water and as it gets larger

58
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,489
it's gonna require more water on this

59
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:06,839
can be changed too and you go to

60
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:08,788
transplant and type of media that you

61
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,348
may use so always make sure you're

62
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,780
maintaining the proper size not going

63
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,889
too much or too little trying to hit

64
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,199
that nice perfect

65
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:19,129
to keep your plants happy which won't

66
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,129
turn make you happy
