1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,600
here on this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,798
we're going to be looking at a product

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,560
you might be familiar with

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:17,199
called root shield and see how it

5
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:18,480
relates to cannabis production

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,760
so in this video i'm going to go over

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,118
using root shield for cannabis

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,519
production and give you some

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,320
studies that looked at investigating the

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,439
effectiveness

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,118
of this particular product so first off

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
here is a reference poster and here's

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,920
the long link you can also see in the

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,920
description

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,359
link to all resources but this is also

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,440
the poster

17
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,439
where they looked at fusarium in

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,039
particular with some other biological

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,238
controls i'll provide you with a general

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,159
summary

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,679
so first off what is root shield i

22
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,119
figure i should just first off describe

23
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,878
what it actually is

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,558
and it does have active ingredients and

25
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:51,839
this is there's root shield and there's

26
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,439
root shield plus

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
what does the plus stand for well it

28
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,599
contains two versions of trichoderma two

29
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,198
different strains of trichoderma here

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
and what is trichoderma it's an organic

31
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,039
biological

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,960
fungicide with dual active ingredients

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,879
in since we have those two strains there

34
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,319
to prevent a broad spectrum of root

35
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,118
diseases and promote

36
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,599
a healthy root system it's registered

37
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,000
fuse

38
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,919
in the united states except alaska rei

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,239
of four hours and post-harvest interval

40
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,000
of zero days this biological control

41
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,839
agent has been reported to be effective

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,239
against a range of root pathogens

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,520
and in this study root shield plus wpu

44
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,798
transfer wettable powder

45
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:32,640
was applied at a rate of 0.02 percent

46
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,640
so looking at biological fungicides in

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
general the evaluation of biobiological

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,280
agents against pathogenic fungi can be

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,118
challenging

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,560
due to the environmental variability

51
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,920
that naturally exists

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,680
so you have to look at these studies and

53
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,079
kind of see if they apply

54
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
and see what conditions that occurred so

55
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,478
we look looking at comparisons

56
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,158
focused on a single pathogen may seem

57
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,438
limiting for a grower's viewpoint but it

58
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,960
does offer some

59
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,519
degree of usable information and

60
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,280
hopefully you find that with this video

61
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,359
so if you see fusarium i'll give the

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,399
oxosporium in proliferation

63
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,478
uh polipher tatum these

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,560
pathogens have been isolated from all

65
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,000
stages of plant growth from vegetative

66
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,878
cuts to mother plants

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,080
that typically show as wilt systems so

68
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,359
grower may recognize i know it's a

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,319
pepper plant but we recognize these

70
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,840
wilting systems

71
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,439
if you look on it on a through a

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,479
microscope this is what the fusion would

73
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,759
actually kind of look like you're

74
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,679
associating with a root

75
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,679
if you were to play it on a petri dish

76
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,599
this is what it may look like

77
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
so treatments impact on disease looking

78
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,280
at the study presented here

79
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,120
root shield containing trichoderma

80
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
reduced infection we can see that

81
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,920
located right here negative control

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,479
means a control plant that was grown

83
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,479
without

84
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,318
any disease and then a positive control

85
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,518
is when it was inoculated with disease

86
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,039
and you can see how these different

87
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,200
products compare

88
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,318
and how they are definitely show

89
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,560
different degrees

90
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,518
of effectiveness so what's the

91
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,360
conclusion

92
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,439
based on the cannabis data provided

93
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,680
there was that root shield did produce a

94
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,079
notable level of disease reduction

95
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,000
however regalia produced a statistically

96
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,760
significant level of disease reduction

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,199
and just to go back to that for a second

98
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,878
this is where regalia was so it was

99
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,399
shown in that study

100
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:09,919
based on this data regalia may be a

101
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,959
better option but root shield would

102
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,280
still be

103
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,920
potential for offer some protection and

104
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
it may offer reduction in other diseases

105
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,598
so it should be considered as a

106
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
potential biopesticide when it comes to

107
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,560
canvas production

108
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,399
remember this would be root applied and

109
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,239
drenched as well

110
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,080
i found another article here looking at

111
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,920
the trichoderma

112
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
and kind of presented here again i'm

113
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,199
provided just a general overview

114
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,959
this was looking at growth and

115
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,759
development of cbd content of

116
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,560
hemp so the study specifics we're

117
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,560
looking at

118
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,158
the study aimed to investigate the

119
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,039
effect of trichoderma ethereum

120
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,719
inoculation

121
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,400
on agronomically and quality

122
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,840
characteristics of two

123
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,120
monishes hemp varieties fedora

124
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,840
17 felina planted in 12 liter pots

125
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
filled with soil and 8 liters of compost

126
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,000
look at the study for more details on

127
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,438
exactly the materials and methods if you

128
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,799
want to learn more information

129
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,560
however the product they used was

130
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
trichoderma hysterium and was a

131
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,878
commercial product

132
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,879
all the details provided here with the

133
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,798
concentration of that product as well

134
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,079
in a greenhouse pot experiment was

135
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,079
conducted in a complete

136
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,280
randomized design of two treatments of

137
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,519
the trichodermatarium

138
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,758
both at a low and a high dose

139
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,360
represented by t1 and t2

140
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,439
the split applications were carried out

141
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,560
through fertigation at

142
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,079
10 and 30 days after sewing so so this

143
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,680
is in the ground so the plants

144
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,039
10 days after and the next one is 30

145
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,478
days after and here we see the control

146
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,479
where no amount was added

147
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,279
t1 and t2 where they basically doubled

148
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,639
the amount of applied fungal spores

149
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,799
so yield characteristics related here um

150
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,160
to the cbd content yield characteristics

151
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,759
and cbd content was

152
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,840
affected by different trichoderma

153
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,319
historium treatments and hemp varieties

154
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:57,279
for the fedora 17 and also felina

155
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,839
so if we're looking here percent cbd we

156
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,478
are seeing

157
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,159
a change and these letters represent

158
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,319
statistically different

159
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,600
levels there and you can pause the video

160
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,639
and take a look at the blood dry weight

161
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,479
the blood length

162
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,199
the in the blood compact index the

163
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:14,478
percent cbd and also the cbd yield

164
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,478
expressed in grams per plant

165
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,159
so what's the conclusion of their study

166
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,758
if you look to go back and pause

167
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,080
the data but the conclusion was the

168
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,160
highest values of plant height

169
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,359
and dry weight were noticed with t2

170
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
especially in the

171
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,240
felina variety trigonometry serum

172
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,560
positively influenced characteristics of

173
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,120
inflorescence such as the number

174
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,959
fresh weight moisture and compactness in

175
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,199
both varieties while the dry weight

176
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,319
length and dry yield of influences was

177
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,879
not improved

178
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,759
finally the fertigation of trichodermal

179
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,519
serum and hemp

180
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,280
plants was beneficial at increasing

181
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,599
cannabidiol or cbd

182
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,879
content especially in the elevated

183
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,800
treatment levels

184
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,639
so again here's this comparison the

185
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
control to the treatment levels

186
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,800
something based on this data you may

187
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,720
want to consider adding to your grow

188
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,919
run control run a trial yourself see if

189
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,520
it does make a difference

190
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,519
but at least there's some data here to

191
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,079
support that it might be worth

192
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,680
the investment in labor to incorporate

193
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,680
into your growing operation
