1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,640
ever wondered how to assess the quality

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:06,898
of dry flower cannabis this debaco

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,580
University video will help you

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,580
understand this exact process

5
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,019
[Music]

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,660
all right let's get into understanding

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,879
cannabis dry flower quality well first

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,439
off what is dry flower cannabis well

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,538
this is the product of cannabis

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,759
cultivation typically referred to as the

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,820
buds dry flower cannabis is the final

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,219
form of the marijuana growing process

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,980
after the plant has been trimmed and cut

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,320
and dried and then cured this has many

15
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,419
medical purposes due to its relieving

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,058
effects it's the most widely popular

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,520
cannabis product as it's Unique to the

18
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,500
cannabis plant most consumer-based

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,660
products come from dry flour cannabis in

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,340
one way or another through extraction or

21
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:54,599
through the actual sale of the actual

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,420
buds

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,340
so how is dry flour kind of graded well

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,039
we're looking at the color of it the

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,500
trichomes the bud structure and overall

26
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,719
the uniformity in an extreme case this

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,159
would be considered your good color good

28
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,319
trichomes good bud structure good

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,880
uniformity good quality cannabis this

30
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,739
would be your lower quality we can see

31
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,478
just kind of the sparseness the

32
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,219
different coloration the lack of

33
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,379
uniformity and density

34
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:21,420
well looking at these uh parameters a

35
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,978
little bit more detail the color varies

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,659
widely based on the cultivar and

37
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,420
therefore should not be the sole basis

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,340
for your grading now for the trichomes

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,079
they are high density or what you're

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,000
looking for in amount of trichomes

41
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,039
correlates to a large amount with the

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,438
cannabinoid production however potency

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,180
does not necessarily mean quality then

44
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,219
we get to the actual structure of the

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,740
buds a larger denser bud structure

46
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,658
usually indicates higher quality growing

47
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:47,519
practices which hopefully translates to

48
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,859
higher quality end product the

49
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,319
uniformity while a bud cannot be truly

50
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,259
uniform the greater amount of uniformity

51
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,639
is desirable and here we see two bugs

52
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,859
that look very different but are both

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
determined to be of high quality colors

54
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,000
are very different but that's just based

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,079
on the variety and the shape very

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,239
different but we can see that there is

57
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,219
some degree of uniformity there

58
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,478
now chemically grating a dry flower

59
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,280
cannabis so that's kind of looking at

60
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,080
from a visual standpoint you can also

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,699
look at the chemical profiles and

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,379
testing is the best way to get a grade

63
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:19,139
of the quality of the Cannabis dry flour

64
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:20,759
that is required to be supplied with

65
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,699
customers and they demand that when

66
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,280
purchasing dry flour so because this is

67
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,859
required this paperwork or at least some

68
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,659
paperwork should go along with any lot

69
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,160
of dry flour cannabis produced and

70
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,419
available for sale this would be your

71
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,039
right they don't provide it from where

72
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,679
you're purchasing you should be able to

73
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,318
request it and get the report

74
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,840
uh that high quality dry flowers we see

75
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,000
here in the pictures of vibrant orange

76
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,580
purple and green colors larger denser

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,259
heavier buds thick coating of trichomes

78
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,260
usually has a sweet floral Aroma if

79
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:54,120
you're able to sample it a few stems no

80
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:55,799
signs of imperfections and proper

81
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,420
trimming and all these kind would be

82
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,360
examples of this even though this one

83
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:02,339
has yet to be finally trimmed that low

84
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,200
quality kind of that comparison this is

85
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,580
your lower quality up here would be your

86
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,280
higher quality kind of as a direct

87
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,500
comparison that lower quality is usually

88
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,900
kind of transporting compressed bricks

89
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,539
usually has a darker colorations with

90
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,879
more Browns and kind of Darker deep

91
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,158
green Hues a lot of stem and leaves this

92
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,679
very Leafly appearance dry earthy smell

93
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,019
and kind of a harsh taste tends to have

94
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,000
low cannabinoid production and trichome

95
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,099
count and this could be evident disease

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,658
or infestation or just really poor

97
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:33,479
growing practices or really just lower

98
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:36,239
grade buds maybe on the same plant

99
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,039
uh there is also failed dry flour so

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,658
keep in mind that when we talk about

101
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,298
that documentation

102
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:44,459
not every uh bun that every dry flower

103
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,500
passes inspection there are ones that

104
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,500
fail the inspection and that could be

105
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,139
for microbial analysis that could be for

106
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,938
heavy metals a whole host of things and

107
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,859
the Fatal dry flower refers to dry

108
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:58,079
flower that has been tested which is

109
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,879
required and has results that are

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,340
outside the acceptable range for

111
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,199
whatever compound testing as I said

112
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,299
includes mycotoxins heavy metals

113
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,339
biological contaminants mold pesticide

114
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,260
residues and there's going to be many

115
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,180
subsets under each of these categories

116
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,620
depending on what the lot failed for

117
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,900
determines if it could be used for

118
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,120
extraction because usually this would

119
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,100
remove whatever reason why it had failed

120
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,720
if it can go on to that process however

121
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,180
realize that the sale price can be

122
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,280
expected to be at most 10 only 10

123
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,560
percent of what the past product would

124
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,819
bring in just as a comparison is why

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,800
it's very important to have good quality

126
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,839
growing practices produce good quality

127
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,540
product that ends up passing inspection

128
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,959
so you get a good return on your

129
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,960
investment
