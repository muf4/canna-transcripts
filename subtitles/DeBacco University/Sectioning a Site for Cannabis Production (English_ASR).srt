1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,280
on this tobacco university video going

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,879
to go over

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,639
sectioning a site for cannabis

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,719
production and how we might want to

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,359
allocate different areas within a large

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,519
field

7
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,039
and how small or what parameters would

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,050
be used for making different

9
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:24,640
ideas or sections within a large field

10
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:26,160
[Music]

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,399
just as we see the different sections of

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,879
pizza let's go into sectioning the site

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,799
for cannabis production so first off

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,479
during the evaluation process

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,439
is when you should kind of have an idea

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,479
of where you might want to have

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,159
different sections

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,519
so when evaluating a potential growth

19
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,319
site there may be different

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,600
differences noticed in one or many parts

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,520
of the process

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,079
growers should section out these into

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,680
subsections to provide specific analysis

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
of these areas differently

25
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,359
than the rest now again how small you

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
make these or what differences do you

27
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,280
notice

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,960
well here we're seeing these dark green

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,320
patches we're seeing these much yellow

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,799
margins is in these brown

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,000
areas as well now it could be very

32
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,158
difficult to

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,359
individually monitor each individual

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,719
little area

35
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,879
so we're looking at where the general

36
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,039
trends are we see this area here

37
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,560
for the most part fairly consistent and

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,479
we see areas over here

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
a little less consistent as well as over

40
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,280
in this region

41
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,478
so when in doubt if there's two sections

42
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,000
in particular that you're going through

43
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,118
and evaluating that appear to be

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,879
different

45
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,719
at the very least growers are advised to

46
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,519
take separate soil samples

47
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,280
for each and can you identify any of

48
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,798
these issues within your field as we see

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640
here this kind of yellowing

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,479
banning that's occurring sometimes this

51
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
can be explained by visual differences

52
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,840
and other times it confirms

53
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,040
that the soil is the same and that

54
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,399
there's another reason for the

55
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,640
difference is noticed

56
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,840
so when we're comparing two sections

57
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,200
well it might be good to take a soil

58
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,600
test from here and here

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,040
if the results come back the same it

60
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,959
might be a water issue

61
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,960
it could be something else that's going

62
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,798
on could be a different kind of soil

63
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,158
a vein that runs through here but it's

64
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,320
good to know especially when you're

65
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,000
evaluating a new site

66
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,359
so at the very least which supposed to

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,599
be doing uh grocery

68
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,799
section should be defined as separate

69
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,519
fields even if

70
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,680
in very close proximity if separate soil

71
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
tests shows similar conditions

72
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,760
then a grower can know that to treat

73
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,440
these two fields in a similar manner

74
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,639
so here if we see these little driving

75
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,359
lanes here and we see these different

76
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,039
blocks

77
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
it would be advised at least initially

78
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,199
to sample these differently

79
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,120
now if these come back the same well now

80
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,958
we know in the future to manage those

81
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,719
very similarly however we're seeing an

82
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,598
elevation change and while they may look

83
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,359
very similar

84
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,359
there's the potential for for great

85
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,760
differences in the 20

86
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,920
soil test can really save a lot of money

87
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,159
in the long run

88
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,000
so how small the area should be section

89
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,598
can go through and how fine do we detail

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,318
something or how broad we detail

91
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,919
something

92
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,399
and really it comes down to the grower's

93
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,759
discretion however when first evaluating

94
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
an area these sections should be as

95
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,039
small as

96
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,719
reasonable to manage in the great scheme

97
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,560
of things soil tests are cheap

98
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,680
and in comparison you probably don't

99
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,959
have to go through this small little

100
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
detail level

101
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,439
but taking a couple more soil tests and

102
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,560
getting them analyzed just to confirm

103
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,598
something that would be a great point of

104
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,318
advisement

105
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,919
however if they do come back the same it

106
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,039
does not mean you have to keep sampling

107
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,878
that many times

108
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,318
but it could initially to get that kind

109
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,799
of idea together

110
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,598
especially if it's a new area now how do

111
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,760
we develop these

112
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,039
subsections well if the field is large

113
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,679
it can be broken into

114
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,199
subsections the boundary of subsections

115
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,360
is often based on past

116
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,280
practices for example as we see here

117
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,000
compost in a cover crop versus compost

118
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,158
only

119
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,719
and this might be the same field be good

120
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,120
to soil sample these separately

121
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,039
some fields also have multiple crops on

122
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
them that are rotated so that can also

123
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,158
be utilized as different subsections to

124
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,920
be sampling

125
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,239
the areas of rotation that have occurred

126
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,559
in the past may be within the same field

127
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,519
so subsectioning would be used to demark

128
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
these areas

129
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,200
and again gives the growers a little bit

130
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,200
more information

131
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,399
now as the grower it's important for to

132
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,958
go through the process of

133
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,879
label and documentation so getting a

134
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,280
printout of the area is important

135
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,120
to get before you go into an area this

136
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,360
will help you orient yourself and also

137
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,360
mark where you're taking soil samples

138
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,680
and what you're going to call each

139
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,720
sample when naming try to select names

140
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,160
that do not change

141
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,160
for example north middle if we're

142
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,840
talking we're in the northern area

143
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,360
and in the middle section of that

144
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,719
particular field

145
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,400
if you're labeling something called like

146
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,160
corn field this is not a great name

147
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,758
because it might be rotated and if

148
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,720
pepper's grown the next year and then

149
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,280
you might rotate back

150
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,639
into hemp and then go into corn so just

151
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,399
keep in mind you want to usually stay

152
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,319
away from crop names

153
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,239
if a farmer is currently using an area

154
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,519
you may want to also make note of what

155
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,519
they call the field

156
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,879
so if you have any questions you can use

157
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,279
their terminology

158
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,199
for example if you you may name it north

159
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,039
middle but if whatever reason the farmer

160
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,600
always calls it grams field

161
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,879
by current land owner that that might be

162
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
what you might want to call it simply

163
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,360
because

164
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,879
that current landowner might know oh

165
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,280
yeah on grandma's field

166
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,519
x y or z it can really just help you

167
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,038
learn it in the sense that you can

168
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,560
utilize some more of that history if

169
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,079
you're calling it by a different name

170
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,319
you might lose some of that background

171
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,918
or history that the previous land owner
