1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
now you get your soil test report back

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,519
you have a bunch of numbers on there

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,759
one of them might be organic matter

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,039
percentage and here on this tobacco

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,199
university video

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,399
we're going to explain its importance to

7
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,919
the overall

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
soil health

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,640
[Music]

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,640
all right let's look at organic matter

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,278
percentage importance in a soil test

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,439
report

13
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,039
now just looking at here a general soil

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,679
should be about five percent organic

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,960
matter

16
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:36,079
50 air and water using 25

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,600
water 25 air 45 inorganic

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,439
mineral matter we're going to focus here

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,359
on that little five percent

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,359
so first off what's the benefits of

21
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,238
organic matter well it improves water

22
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,159
retention

23
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,000
increases nutrient holding capacities

24
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,398
encourages better soil structure

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,320
enhances root growth increases aeration

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,120
provides supporting environment for soil

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,960
organisms

28
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,799
and serves as a reservoir for plant

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
nutrients when you read all these

30
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,119
benefits you would think i want to grow

31
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,198
in 100

32
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,519
organic matter uh but really that can

33
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,879
also cause some negative effects there

34
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,640
so this is uh good and these are the

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,840
benefits of it but it's good

36
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,280
in moderation so sources of organic

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,000
matter what are some areas we can get

38
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,159
organic matter

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,719
from and they include leaf mold peat

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,400
moss compost as well as manures

41
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,719
the ideal amount of organic matter

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,478
varies by crop and by soil type

43
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,719
for instance sandy soils may benefit

44
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:27,599
from greater additions of organic matter

45
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,519
than finer textured loans large editions

46
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,359
of compost or manure can result in

47
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,798
excessive applications of phosphorus so

48
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,719
keep that in mind

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,200
it's easy to apply excessive amounts of

50
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,438
phosphorus an application greater than

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,159
quarter inch of compost or manure can

52
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,839
supply an excess amount of phosphorus

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,240
so as i mentioned organic matter can be

54
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
a good thing but it's very easy and very

55
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,000
commonly done

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,640
where it's over applied now how much

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,078
organic matter should i be adding

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
the ideal amount of organic matter

59
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,000
really varies by crop and soil type

60
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,679
for instance sandy soils i said may

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,159
benefit from greater amounts of organic

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,840
matter

63
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,000
than those finer textured limbs so it's

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,000
important to know what base mixture

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,118
you're starting with large editions of

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,318
compost can cause

67
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,919
us excessive amounts to occur so be

68
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,598
aware that when we're looking at what

69
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,079
the ideal range should be

70
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,799
typically the darker soil will have that

71
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,959
darker

72
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,520
higher amounts of organic matter what do

73
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,439
you want to shoot for or aim for

74
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,040
a five percent would be a good average

75
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,919
to kind of kind of aim for if you're

76
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,919
looking at a number

77
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,039
if it wants to know what's the number

78
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,759
but you don't need

79
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,719
10 percent 15 percent that some soils

80
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,719
may have

81
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,560
if they've over added that organic

82
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,359
matter because you can can get into

83
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,959
excessive

84
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,879
nutrients particularly phosphorus if

85
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,360
you're using manures

86
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,039
now excessive organic matter additions

87
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,160
due to all the benefits stated growers

88
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,039
have a tendency to think

89
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,639
more is better however it is possible to

90
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,560
over add and get many negative

91
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,559
impacts and things like what could be a

92
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,039
negative impact from over adding organic

93
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,959
matter

94
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,239
well you can also you can get increased

95
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,598
disease pressure

96
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,680
in the sense you're holding so much

97
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,959
water that that can really

98
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,200
help breed a lot of negative organisms

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
and cause a chance for increased disease

100
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,000
to your plants

101
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,919
also some of these organic matters

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
especially fresh or organic matters

103
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,079
contain

104
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,080
nitrogen if you over at it you get the

105
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,840
nitrogen bloat of your plants

106
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,599
and also as i mentioned you can get

107
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,719
environmental contamination particularly

108
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,719
with phosphorus

109
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,318
so it's important to know that while

110
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,239
organic matter can be a great thing and

111
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,119
help improve your soil structure

112
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,400
too much of a good thing is ends results

113
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
in it being a bad thing
