00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,640
here we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,440
well-known cannabis options now there

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,638
are many many options just here to

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,839
provide you with

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:16,160
some representative examples for these

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,519
certain categories that will be outlined

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,039
here

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,559
now as i said there are many options

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,480
there's many current options

11
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,679
with many more entering the market each

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,118
and every year

13
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,439
so your stream should be selected based

14
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:30,000
on what best matches your specific

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,679
growing conditions with and to aid in

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,039
providing a general list a few strains

17
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,839
are mentioned here

18
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,000
to help act as a source for comparison

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,200
now finding unbiased data is advised

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
whenever possible

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
as string descriptions make each seem

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,719
like the only one you would ever

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
need to grow and you'll see some of

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,399
those kind of descriptions provided here

25
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,599
but why is to kind of get try to get

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,480
some unbiased data to try to get the

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,320
largest pool or ideas selection of data

28
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,238
to try to get an idea of exactly how

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
these may perform

30
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,640
so when we're looking at performance you

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,079
also want to be an informed consumer

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,439
so how do you become an informed

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,879
consumer well this is looking also at

34
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,920
the end products or what they may

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,280
produce

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,439
this is for any string purchased a coa

37
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
certificate of authenticity should be

38
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,079
provided

39
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,519
this holds true if you're purchasing an

40
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,640
end product or looking for what strains

41
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,319
to grow as well

42
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,239
as far as what may have produced that

43
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,919
now here we're looking at a concentrated

44
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,839
extract and cbd oil

45
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,600
but it's particularly looking at dry

46
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
flour as well

47
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,679
and even potentially more importantly

48
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
where is the testing line what is the

49
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,840
data showing

50
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,478
an independent lab so we're going to

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,118
focus here on high cbd strains

52
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,879
so be aware though that just because it

53
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,200
is a high cbd strain

54
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,519
you also need to take into consideration

55
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
that the 0.3 thc limit

56
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,879
which does make many of the high cbd

57
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,519
strains above

58
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,078
the federal thc limit so just because

59
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,039
it's high

60
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,158
cbd does not automatically necessarily

61
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,399
classify it as

62
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,320
hemp may still fall into the marijuana

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,840
category if you're above 0.3 percent thc

64
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,279
now popular common strains will be

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,719
provided as a starting point on the

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,560
following slides with

67
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,159
website provided descriptions to provide

68
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
some background for each strain

69
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,000
in the description there's a link to the

70
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,759
lecture sides there's also a link to

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,400
sources that you're welcome to check out

72
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,519
and as always any subscriptions that you

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,599
make to this channel

74
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,120
are always appreciated now indica cbd so

75
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,159
just looking at an indica's

76
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,800
cbd the og kush you can see all of the

77
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,079
consistent test certificate here where

78
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,680
it's going to give you some of the

79
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,519
cannabinoid

80
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,159
id it's going to give the weight the

81
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,840
concentrations in milligrams per gram

82
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,079
and again a signature here kind of

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,680
signed off when it was tested

84
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,360
and kind of some additional information

85
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
again something you should be getting

86
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,000
with any material you are purchasing

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,280
yourself

88
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
energy kush this is just said to have um

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,080
with resin notes of cinnamon diesel and

90
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
sweet grass this dense purple flower is

91
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,480
perfect for low thc

92
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,599
variation on a cannabis classic

93
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,679
the total thc content of just 0.28 this

94
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,560
batch of og flour is a great choice for

95
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
anyone looking

96
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,400
to get minimum thc doses with a full

97
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,598
spectrum product and again that's quoted

98
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,519
in the website

99
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:18,158
so if it truly does test at that 0.28

100
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,239
thc this would classify as hemp which

101
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,719
opens up a lot more opportunities for

102
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,120
growing this particular strain

103
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,158
they have an indica cbd this is cherry

104
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,640
wine

105
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,798
and as a name suggests terpenes in this

106
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,878
be to crackle with a pop of sweet stone

107
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,159
fruit layered with piney peppery

108
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,039
undertones i always love the

109
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,840
descriptions

110
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,120
that some websites give to cannabis

111
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
flowers here

112
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,280
you can see that the terpene profile is

113
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,039
additionally listed here and you can see

114
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,519
it does favor some more versus some

115
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,039
others

116
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,719
so again that might be important to you

117
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,039
for consideration

118
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,400
uh again cherry wine is also a cbd rich

119
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,239
powers capable of delivering a lovely

120
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,120
balance and smoke ability according to

121
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,799
the website

122
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
so again something just to consider

123
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,080
there where we're looking at you know

124
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,840
what is the thc level

125
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,599
and is it below that zero critical 0.3

126
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,479
level it definitely looks like based on

127
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,719
this test that it would be

128
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,238
however we also need to consider what

129
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,959
our states are using

130
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,720
for thc levels as far as is it just

131
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,519
delta 9 thc this would fall into the

132
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,479
category

133
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,399
but if we're looking at max dhc looking

134
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,478
at some of the conversion factors

135
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,679
and delta h is not considered but we

136
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,039
have that thc a

137
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,360
as well but some states take to

138
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,560
consideration so be mindful of what

139
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,120
state you're growing in

140
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,639
that can determine where that line does

141
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,879
lay

142
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
they have hawaiian haze and this is kind

143
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,079
of more of that

144
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
warm citrusy kind of tropical fruit as

145
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,478
they associate with it that's probably

146
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,399
how it got its name

147
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,478
you could see its terpene profile here

148
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,000
as well it's delta 9

149
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:52,639
thc level as well as the ghcv

150
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,160
and thca levels there so again be

151
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,680
mindful what state you're in

152
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,240
but this is another one to consider if

153
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,160
you're looking at a c higher cbd strain

154
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,000
that also has sativa-like morphologies

155
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
then we have this it's another sativa

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,319
based cbd the electra here

157
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
just again another option to look at and

158
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,918
as you can see with all these options

159
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
if these numbers do change these terpene

160
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,359
profiles do change

161
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,879
uh so i've tried to keep the test

162
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,120
relatively consistent

163
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,240
just so you have that nice sense of

164
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,160
comparison

165
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,680
now remember they also say choice if

166
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,320
you're looking for a relaxing daytime

167
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,319
strain

168
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,319
because they're assuming it's a sativa

169
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,959
but keep in mind again sativa is

170
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,478
referring

171
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,198
or is greater correlation to the

172
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,879
morphology and not necessarily the

173
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,639
effects i always caution people when

174
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,159
they read something like this

175
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,680
that it's all relaxing daytime stream

176
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,320
because it's sativa

177
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,959
not always the case these sativas and

178
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,439
indicas

179
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,439
are really more correlated with the

180
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,360
plant morphology

181
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,959
now we have a hybrid here of cbds is the

182
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,680
wife cbd

183
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,159
and looking at this one it's a high cbd

184
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,038
hemp strain that packs more than 18

185
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,680
we said they quote cbd with a skunky and

186
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:01,918
sweet

187
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,759
aromatic profile this hybrid hemp strain

188
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,799
is mellow with tangy flavors profile

189
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,680
notes of cherry

190
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,038
the y2d hemp flower has dense green buds

191
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,639
and you can see again here is your

192
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,839
certificate of analysis

193
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,759
something you definitely should be

194
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,239
looking at considering with

195
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,840
anything you're looking to purchase so i

196
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
hope this was helpful and just looking

197
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,560
at

198
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,758
some of the cbd varieties or strains

199
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,519
that are available

200
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,280
to at least start some of your research

201
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,959
as you go through and determine

202
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,959
what you may want to grow yourself
