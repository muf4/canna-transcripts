1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
swallowers no it's important to irrigate

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:07,619
their crops they might not realize the

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,210
options that they that do exist to what

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,879
are their plants so we're gonna go over

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,320
just a couple of those here so first off

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,080
irrigation options while there are many

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,579
options here to choose from the goal is

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,259
to officially deliver water to the

9
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,689
plants that's coming for all of them and

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,970
the best fit may depend on the exact

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,589
operation whether it's field roan or

12
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:27,599
indoor Verona container Verona what type

13
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:31,289
of media you're using you can see here

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,880
the athletic field here using pop-up

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,000
sprinklers kind of overhead irrigation

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,500
is the best for this operation others we

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,628
have hand watering against the version

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,299
of overhead or drip irrigation are all

19
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:44,878
options worth considering so first off

20
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,558
hand watering it's only good for small

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,269
operations and even in this situation

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,979
it's really not advised it's a very

23
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,660
time-consuming and not very efficient

24
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,369
process you should only be used to

25
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,349
supplement other methods to compensate

26
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:56,759
for potential dry spots so it shouldn't

27
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,800
be the main source it should be kind of

28
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,599
a supplement till one of the other main

29
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,229
sources simply because it's just so

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,879
time-consuming

31
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,250
you're really not offering that much

32
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,810
benefits to the plants especially in

33
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,810
areas where you have a very eaten

34
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,600
conditions overhead irrigation outdoor

35
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,490
applications only would be advised for

36
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,809
this I don't want to get a mess and an

37
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:17,879
indoor especially running lights it

38
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,549
could be a very negative effect there I

39
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,658
should still be used sparingly the

40
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,400
reason why overhead should be used

41
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,750
sparingly is it what's the leaves and

42
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,240
buds and this is why it's not a good

43
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,030
option I can increase mold that could

44
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,828
occur and get all bad things you if you

45
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,150
must use it I have run it early in the

46
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:35,429
morning when plants are typically

47
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,530
covered in morning dew anyway so you're

48
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,670
not kind of real etic rewetting leaves

49
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,400
you're already kind of getting leaves

50
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,170
and flowers that might be well already

51
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,390
you're kind of just rewetting them

52
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,618
you're not running it at a time that

53
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,618
you're kind of free inducing more

54
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:51,659
moisture than would be there normally

55
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:53,009
there's micro sprinklers so these are

56
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,570
kind of like an overhead can hardly get

57
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,459
the size orientation these are smaller

58
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,139
there's specific type of that overhead

59
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,688
irrigation and you're best utilized to

60
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,728
cover areas with low volumes of water

61
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:04,258
there's inverted for overhead and

62
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:06,629
there's vertical or pop-ups as we see

63
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,899
here and they spin so they act in a very

64
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:11,430
similar manner to overhead irrigation

65
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,930
there's also fogging equipment so

66
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,920
typically this is not considered a

67
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,540
source of irrigation

68
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,759
I don't think you're using a fogger for

69
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,310
irrigation using that more for cooling

70
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,159
cuz it's producing the lily that's very

71
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,439
very fine mist and see in the outdoor

72
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,840
operation here for kind of demonstration

73
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,430
purposes but they can be used in indoor

74
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,920
operations we see the lights hanging

75
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,620
here this aqua fog placed right in the

76
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,208
grow facility water is applied is

77
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,430
intended for cooling or humidity

78
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,259
regulation not to hydrate the plants

79
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,659
directly so even though you are using

80
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,939
water don't consider us as a form of

81
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,889
irrigation the goal is to wet the leaf

82
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,719
surface but not to the point of runoff

83
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,639
if we're looking at a true fogging

84
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,050
system some people will say they're

85
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,569
using the fogging system and kind of

86
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,219
like overuse it and what the leaves of

87
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,599
the plants and get it to run off and

88
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,819
kind of use it as a form of irrigation

89
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,189
if you're using a true fighting system

90
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,019
not very efficient for that purpose

91
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:07,050
better for cooling and humidity

92
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,090
regulation then there's drip irrigation

93
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,390
this is a very efficient way to deliver

94
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:15,390
water and nutrients as the water Li will

95
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,458
one drip at a time reach the plants we

96
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,889
could see kind of this long run here of

97
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,979
how that drip irrigation operates this

98
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:24,659
is a low volume low pressure system does

99
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:26,369
require an initial investment in all

100
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,680
this material but once invested it can

101
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,180
last for several years it can also be

102
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,930
easily automated with timers and

103
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,489
fertilizer injectors for canvassers ease

104
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,650
up coming in very popular these

105
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,680
irrigation rings they're typically uses

106
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,959
a modified drip irrigation system for

107
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,670
even watering of containers and that

108
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,620
could be soured pots or plastic pots

109
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:48,629
it's specifically marketed for Kansas

110
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,819
production because of the typically the

111
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:52,349
high demand of water for the plant and

112
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,949
also the ability to cover each

113
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:58,289
individual plant very efficiently keep

114
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,000
in mind if you are using containers for

115
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:01,409
indoor operations in particular all

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
containers need to have a way to catch

117
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,489
the extra water some sort of Basin below

118
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,950
them these catch bins or simple drains

119
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,360
necessary to prevent standing water from

120
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,969
collecting and sitting in the bottom of

121
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,380
the container either way for that

122
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:15,870
moisture to go to or that water to go to

123
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,579
especially if you're flushing plants and

124
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,530
just a gray to keep an eye on to make

125
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,329
sure that you are getting a sufficient

126
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,239
water in the chosen media that you are

127
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,530
using lastly if your are using storage

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,569
tanks as part of your irrigation system

129
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:29,939
it's important to monitor and clean this

130
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,349
on a regular basis too often if they're

131
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,660
sitting in place people just kind of

132
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,460
fill them and use them they won't worry

133
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,770
about you know any sort of contaminants

134
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,899
especially if they're outdoors they can

135
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:41,490
build up algae potentially if they're

136
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,199
mobile like this was in sealed still

137
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,490
keep an eye look and inspect it to make

138
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,229
sure there's nothing growing there you

139
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,579
don't want they can be difficult to

140
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,140
clean tanks that if you're used for

141
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,300
gravity systems and are high on a tower

142
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,639
but still worth the extra to quick time

143
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,100
to go check to make sure they are clean

144
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,349
so you don't ruin an entire crop due to

145
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,760
a dirty tank because of the lack of the

146
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,920
grower digging this there's a couple

147
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,230
seconds to kind of monitor it if it is

148
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,090
dirty taking the time then to spend to

149
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,860
clean that to make sure that the water

150
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:10,169
that irrigating their plants worth is as

151
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,129
clean as pure as possible to reduce the

152
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,129
chance of contamination
