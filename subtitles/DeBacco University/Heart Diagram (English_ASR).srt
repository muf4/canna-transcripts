1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
here I'm gonna go over the hurt diagram

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,140
and how it does not look like the image

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,910
pictured here I suggest you get a clean

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,759
sheet of paper out and a pen or pencil

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,888
so I want you to be able to draw a heart

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,809
and diagram I'm gonna go over kind of

7
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,399
the may seem like awkward way we're

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,118
gonna draw it but I think it'll make

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,339
more sense

10
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:22,679
so starting we'll just get you familiar

11
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,629
with the simple heart diagram these are

12
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,118
some of the basic components you should

13
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:30,118
be familiar with the atrium the

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,890
ventricle some of the valves well if you

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,710
I asked you to draw this it's a little

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,840
bit difficult the orientation where

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,058
everything is located so what we're

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,809
going to focus on for our sketch or our

19
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:44,549
drawing is not a necessarily

20
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:46,859
anatomically correct picture of the

21
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,988
heart but a square heart and what does

22
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:50,549
that look like well this is kind of a

23
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:52,578
square heart diagrams I think these are

24
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:54,929
very helpful the sense of understanding

25
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:57,570
exactly how things look and where things

26
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:00,000
are located so I'll draw attention to

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,960
this image first we see on the left hand

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,790
side here our a and our V you might

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,219
think well didn't they label this wrong

30
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,990
is in this little left side why is this

31
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:11,908
the right atria why is this the right

32
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,339
ventricle well that's simply because

33
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,689
we're looking at oriented in the body to

34
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,439
be the right side the body in the left

35
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:18,658
side of the body

36
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,669
so from our perspective looking at the

37
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,350
square diagram this would be the

38
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,840
deoxygenated this left hands had to be

39
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:27,359
the deoxygenated side or the right side

40
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,590
of the heart would be deoxygenated on

41
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:33,599
the left side of the heart is the

42
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,478
oxygenated blood and that's indicated in

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,789
red here the top here is our pulmonary

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,368
circuit going to the lungs that here's

45
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,649
our systemic go into the body so

46
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:45,328
starting with that right atrium that is

47
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,640
receiving blood from the body the

48
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,228
deoxygenated blood from the body so

49
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,079
that's where blood is first entering at

50
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:54,810
that right atrium then passing to the

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,339
right ventricle where then it's going to

52
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,469
be pumped out to the lungs

53
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,740
you see our blue line becomes our red

54
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:04,169
line our d'action blood becomes red even

55
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,000
though in real life it's just different

56
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,469
shades of red

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,189
after that blood comes back from the

58
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:12,930
lungs it's entering the left atrium from

59
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,629
that left atrium it's going down to left

60
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,030
ventricle

61
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:18,099
this chamber of the heart has the

62
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,509
greatest amount of muscle because this

63
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,509
left ventricle needs to pump blood out

64
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:25,750
to the entire body so we've got our

65
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:28,299
right atrium going to our right

66
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,400
ventricle going to then the lungs coming

67
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,100
back from the lungs so that left atrium

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,969
and into the left ventricle now we're

69
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:36,400
going to make this a little bit more

70
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:38,139
complicated that blood that's coming

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,939
into the right atrium well that's coming

72
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:42,939
in the vena cava so we want to label

73
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:45,340
that it's getting a pass to the right

74
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:47,289
ventricle when it leaves to light the

75
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,569
right ventricle it is going to the

76
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:52,150
pulmonary artery where it's entering the

77
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:54,280
lungs after it gets oxygenated in the

78
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,500
lungs it returns from the pulmonary vein

79
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,469
remember arteries carry blood away from

80
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,900
the heart veins carry blood towards the

81
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:04,960
heart this is oxygenated blood coming

82
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,180
back into the heart at the left atrium

83
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,159
it's Indian passed the left ventricle

84
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,099
and going out the aorta to the rest of

85
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:14,680
the body now one last thing I want you

86
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:17,530
know make note of and add to your square

87
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,480
heart diagram are the valve names so I

88
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,819
want just back here for a second from

89
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,349
our right atrium to our right ventricle

90
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,889
watch the label that says the tricuspid

91
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:28,650
valve then after the blood leaves the

92
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:30,759
right ventricle heads to the lungs

93
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,270
before it goes out the pulmonary artery

94
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:36,069
has to pass through the pulmonary valve

95
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,710
then that gets oxygenated comes back in

96
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:40,689
the left atrium as it travels from the

97
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:45,610
left atrium to the left ventricle goes

98
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:48,879
through the material valve from that

99
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,980
valves there before it pumps to the rest

100
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,490
of the body there at the aorta it has to

101
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:57,909
go through the aortic valve so make sure

102
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:00,370
you have the atrium the valves and also

103
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:02,979
the proper veins and arteries labeled

104
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,379
and in a square heart I find that's the

105
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:08,019
most easiest way for students to

106
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:10,509
understand once you have this completed

107
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,939
way to look now at this image the heart

108
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:14,769
detailed image it's heart to be able to

109
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,930
put together all the different

110
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:20,799
components there I do want to make note

111
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:23,110
that the a trio pin ticular valve here

112
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,120
is sometimes that is what it's called

113
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,580
here see our tricuspid valve and the

114
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,348
trail valve here they do kind of go by

115
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:31,089
name's I think it's a little easier to

116
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:33,550
tell them apartment a tricuspid here

117
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:35,589
between on the right atrium and the

118
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,668
right ventricle in the material between

119
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:41,168
the left atrium and the left ventricle

120
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:43,478
hopefully this is helpful starting to

121
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:45,728
understand the complexities of the four

122
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:48,098
chamber hurt and the pathway blood takes

123
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:50,139
through the heart as it receives from

124
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:52,089
the rest of the body goes out to the

125
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:54,370
lungs comes back in the lungs after it's

126
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:57,399
after need they get sent out the aorta

127
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,848
to all of the necessary components of

128
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,848
our body
