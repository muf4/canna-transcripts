1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,799
now you may not realize it but there's

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,850
actually different types of lab water so

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,890
we might just think water is all the

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:09,570
same h2o well that's not necessarily the

5
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:10,859
case just like some people aren't

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,469
familiar there's different types or

7
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,968
grades of maple syrup so when would we

8
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:16,378
use these different types of lab or what

9
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,769
are they I'm going to try to explain

10
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,330
here so these different types of lab

11
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,550
water are referring to different levels

12
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,229
of purity higher levels of purity are

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,278
needed for very sensitive techniques

14
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,518
where containments could negatively

15
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:32,719
impact the results so these higher

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:35,280
levels of purity we want to be using on

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,840
experiments and protocols will call for

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,989
these when you're using equipment that

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,340
has high degree of sensitivity why not

20
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:43,289
just use the highest purity all the time

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,390
well simply put it's because of cost

22
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,769
this cost a lot more also it's not

23
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,628
needed in the majority of cases would be

24
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,370
a waste so you want to be sure that

25
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:54,210
you're using the purity for the

26
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:56,099
sensitivity of the equipment that you

27
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,829
have go to the high sensitive equipment

28
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,929
you can use a lower grade it's a lot

29
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,588
less expensive you're going to get the

30
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:06,840
same end result so type 1 is ultra pure

31
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:08,760
water this is the purest grade of lab

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,299
water there is use for highly critical

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,909
applications mass spec is one that

34
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,890
really requires this ultra pure water if

35
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,840
you're doing trace element analysis that

36
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,549
can be another one because if there's

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,710
trace elements in that water those are

38
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,020
going to negatively influence the

39
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:28,769
results there's biotechnology we're

40
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:31,500
using RNAs aren't and DNA's free water

41
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:32,819
we're looking at is pure water it

42
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,420
doesn't have any way that comes going to

43
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,158
break down or mess with DNA studies that

44
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,560
you may be doing won't break down any of

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,420
those so again these are ultra pure

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,259
water type one the highest grade of

47
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,719
water very expensive as well pure water

48
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,368
tech to recommended source for ultra

49
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,219
pure systems to please from buffers

50
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:56,489
marker biology media prep it's very

51
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:58,468
clean water it's not quite type one used

52
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:59,699
in areas where microbiology we don't

53
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:02,129
want to grow other microbiology

54
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,460
organisms or looking at using something

55
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:07,798
that is a source of water and it's less

56
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,409
expensive in the tank one and often used

57
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,719
in these particular cases

58
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:13,979
type 3 is instrument fed fued water

59
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,189
should say

60
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:20,310
we're looking at its produced using RL

61
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:23,519
water reverse osmosis or the the

62
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,930
distillation process most commonly used

63
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,840
water grades it type threes the most

64
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,969
common are most cases is typically fine

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,189
glassware washers can use this humidity

66
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:35,159
chambers autoclaves all these can

67
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:38,159
typically require distilled water or

68
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,959
reverse osmosis water sills can use that

69
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,030
such a high degree that in some labs

70
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,580
will be distilled water on tap sort of

71
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,169
speak it would be a large tank or a kind

72
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,000
of a plumbing system that allows a

73
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:50,759
separate faucet to be used to get that

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,509
water so because this is a clean water

75
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,939
source and used in many experiments

76
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:59,129
lastly tap water as its name implies it

77
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,379
comes directly from the faucet tap often

78
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:03,479
contains minerals easiest to get and

79
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,919
least expensive if the procedure only

80
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,759
states water this is the type that's

81
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:11,339
assumed simply because the small amounts

82
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,109
of kind of other minerals or particulate

83
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,939
that might be in there aren't considered

84
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,340
to be levels that will impact the

85
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,079
results of the study and if it says add

86
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,670
water you can probably get away with

87
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,530
just tap water otherwise it will specify

88
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:24,298
the type of water that's required

89
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,590
hopefully it didn't complicate things

90
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:27,569
too much and developed a better

91
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,060
understanding of the fact that there are

92
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:32,659
different grades of lab water and where

93
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,659
they need to use
