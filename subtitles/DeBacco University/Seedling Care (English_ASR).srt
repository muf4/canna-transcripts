1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
okay assuming successful termination and

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,209
emergence you're gonna have this

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,820
seedling to care for so if you'd be

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:12,120
important to go and discuss how to

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,638
properly take care of that seedling so

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,108
ideally four to nine or so days after

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,089
soaking your seeds you should start to

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,279
see a break in the surface and emergency

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:21,989
occur the first leaves you're gonna see

10
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,750
these are leaves located right here in

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:26,788
here we're called cotyledons these or

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,559
seed leaves these are smooth and have

13
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,260
the smooth margins with no serrations

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,030
the leaves here and here kind of in the

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,920
east-west direction are called true

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,359
leaves in this case these are the ones

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,829
that look like the normal leaves and the

18
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,960
plant will continue to produce these

19
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,058
Catalans or see leaves only show

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,590
initially after emergence and then all

21
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:46,409
the leaves after that will be called

22
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,940
true leaves so sealants should be

23
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:49,799
receiving light so they can start to

24
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,929
produce turbine sugars you're looking

25
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,328
about eighteen hours of light the key

26
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,939
part is six hours of continual darkness

27
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,500
daily you do not need to use high output

28
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:00,509
lights for the stage of growth seasons

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,579
actually prefer less intense light kind

30
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:04,319
of show here kind of filtered light this

31
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,450
could be fluorescent lighting or dimmed

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,000
higher output lights used for the first

33
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,740
two to three weeks if you do only have

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,390
high intensity lights they can be used

35
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,728
just be sure to keep them a good

36
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,320
distance away typically at least three

37
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:18,659
four even sometimes five feet away from

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,099
your seedlings didn't that as possible

39
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,590
or put shade netting in between the

40
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,750
light and your newly emerged seedlings

41
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,930
fluorescents can be about six or twelve

42
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,209
inches away for the same result the

43
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,590
anatomy of the seedling gel-fit look

44
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:34,469
over here we've our cotyledons these are

45
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,299
our seed leaves true leaves and then

46
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,548
below will have a tap root which is the

47
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,049
main central root that comes down and us

48
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,909
that will have these small little root

49
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,240
hairs which are very important for

50
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,740
nutrient and water absorption caring for

51
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,469
your new seedlings I can't over stress

52
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,489
this enough do not over fertilize

53
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,950
typically seedlings do not need much

54
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:54,719
fertilizer at all and most growers will

55
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,189
add too much nutrients are overly

56
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,530
concentrated mixture and burn their own

57
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:00,118
seedlings i've grown at all the shelves

58
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,799
of all the latest nutrients they want to

59
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:03,989
feed their CDs right out of the get-go

60
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,570
want to make sure it's very dilute if at

61
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:08,969
all excusing the key part is they should

62
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,639
be receiving about 18 hours of

63
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:13,530
continuous light and even moisture in a

64
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,019
consistent environment that's more

65
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,459
Portland trying to compensate with

66
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:21,140
nutrients which oftentimes will likely

67
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:24,000
burn a small tender seedling one as for

68
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:25,979
Pythium or damping off which can awesome

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,409
occur in sealant trays or early on

70
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,149
especially if over watering occurs the

71
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,250
room temperature is cold which is below

72
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,750
60 degrees Fahrenheit or 20 B Celsius

73
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,419
will also encourage this problem to

74
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,389
occur and using the seedling heating mat

75
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,399
is advised to get above that temperature

76
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:43,379
to avoid or reduce the chance of Pythium

77
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,080
wiping out an entire tray of newly

78
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,900
emerged seedlings deep in your ceiling

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,100
going well fertilizing typically starts

80
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,010
one or two weeks after the initial

81
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,930
emergence over this initial week diluted

82
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,549
for lighter can slowly be added but

83
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,920
don't push the sealant along too much

84
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,719
because you can burn them kelp and humic

85
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,549
acids are good sources to start with is

86
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,590
the odds of harm or minimal the

87
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,900
commission could be helpful to Bennis to

88
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,890
develop in roots especially growing in

89
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,510
soil based media's irrigating your

90
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,458
seedlings the goals consistent moisture

91
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,739
too much or too little water can cause

92
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,289
negative impacts on your seedlings avoid

93
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,090
excessive water place ceilings on a tray

94
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:23,639
are great to allow good at drainage to

95
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,989
occur monitor soil moisture and remember

96
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,429
that depending on what light source use

97
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,890
can also impact the amount of water

98
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,360
using those high intensity lights they

99
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,649
may dry out a little bit quicker and you

100
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,940
want to keep those conditions as

101
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,799
consistent as possible for those

102
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:36,209
seedlings what makes the process a

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,650
little complicated is that water in each

104
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,459
of the plant will change as it grows

105
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,170
kind of one hit that nice average middle

106
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,519
misting systems can be installed key

107
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,108
part is to keep that environment as

108
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,810
consistent for those newly emerged

109
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,640
Schumann's as possible if you want to

110
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,719
transplant seedlings so in roots fill or

111
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,969
reach the bottom of the container it's

112
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,979
time for transplanting typically this is

113
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:58,289
about three weeks to a month after

114
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,179
initial seed soaking is marked by two or

115
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:01,679
three sets of true leaves again this

116
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,109
depends on the size continue that you're

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,430
using this is a very small plug that's

118
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:06,540
important to keep your ceilings under

119
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,670
light to help prevent them from getting

120
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,500
leggy want these to stretch out getting

121
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:12,679
led user they get really tall making

122
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,639
flop or heart develop weak stem use

123
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,228
ports of these root hairs that I

124
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,478
mentioned they're very important they're

125
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,769
single celled root hairs that are the

126
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,048
mainstay of nutrient and water

127
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,610
absorption while the importance of the

128
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,529
plant is high so it was the likelihood

129
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,270
of damage they're only one cell thick

130
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:29,459
very important we maintain

131
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,659
as many of those as possible did order

132
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,769
to do that we want to limit route

133
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,720
disturbance throughout the entire

134
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:36,269
planets lifecycle with a high priority

135
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,610
for growers especially in transplanting

136
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:40,889
or early on phase transplant is when

137
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,750
these routes can be very severely

138
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,658
damaged or any sort of disturbance

139
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,189
especially when the plant is small light

140
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:49,259
duration for our seedlings we kind of

141
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:51,149
see the change in night lengths or day

142
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,580
lengths depending on the seasonality of

143
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:55,589
the year typically you want that 16 to

144
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:57,598
18 hours of light with it eight to six

145
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:59,489
hours of continual darkness this will

146
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:01,379
also help keep the cannabis plant in the

147
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,240
vegetative state and not induce

148
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,379
flowering the type of light you use will

149
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,000
determine on the proper distance from

150
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:12,000
the ceiling the for its maximum if that

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,709
benefit no plants can be illuminated

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,379
with a green light so plants cannot

153
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:19,049
perceive this which will count as areas

154
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:21,899
of darkness the key part here is to

155
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,579
maximize the plant growth we don't need

156
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:26,008
to run necessary for 24 hours some

157
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:29,038
growers will the key part is if you get

158
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:31,229
under that 16 hours the budding and

159
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,318
flowering will be initiated even at the

160
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:35,818
seedling stage and want to avoid that

161
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,468
you want to encourage root growth so

162
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,539
excessive water will literally suffocate

163
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:41,449
roots and because they need to breathe

164
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:43,500
and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide

165
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:45,329
excessive water can also increase the

166
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,339
odds of root rots and soil pathogens

167
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:49,528
damping off Pythium site after and all

168
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,609
sorts of negative issues using that he

169
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:52,319
met will help elevate the soil

170
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,330
temperature and improve it route to

171
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,009
formation but getting hotter than 90

172
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:58,649
degrees Fahrenheit will lead to reduced

173
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:02,370
root growth so again what a warm root

174
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:05,399
zone but not a hot root zone as ceilings

175
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,680
get older I want to establish adequate a

176
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,329
root system above in the above-ground

177
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,370
portion will start to grow exponentially

178
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:13,348
it's important to transition plate from

179
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,968
ceiling to the vegetative stage often

180
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:16,439
this requires repotting into larger

181
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:18,689
containers to reduce pop mountain roots

182
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,310
which will stunt plants want to avoid

183
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:22,110
the situation where all you see is root

184
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,449
you can see this plant started in the

185
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,430
plug went to a larger pot and now is in

186
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,680
an even larger pot here and that

187
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,740
sequence of steps allows it to grow out

188
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,810
and fill those containers and allows for

189
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,788
efficient packing of plants in a small

190
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,870
area

191
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:38,098
lastly some people think well why bother

192
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,810
going through the transplant of all

193
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,180
these different plants I wanted to start

194
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,160
a 10 gallon pie

195
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,900
isn't it made negative effects because

196
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,010
ten gallon pots take up a lot of space

197
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:48,709
especially we're talking about a very

198
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:50,360
small seedling roots may not be

199
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:52,519
contained so they'll not be forced more

200
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,620
top growth which is kind of spread out

201
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:57,829
they're heavy to move they require a lot

202
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,300
of media or soil they don't allow for

203
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:01,279
root inspections during the transplant

204
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,410
process can we speed it is not properly

205
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,209
sex meaning regarding a lot of male

206
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,410
plants so that's why I go into this

207
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,969
process of translating that's not

208
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,100
necessary a bad thing and it's

209
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,660
transitioning your newly emerged

210
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,350
seedling to getting ready for the

211
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,350
vegetative stage
