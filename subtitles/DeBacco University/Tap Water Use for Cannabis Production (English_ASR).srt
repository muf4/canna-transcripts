00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,760
here on tobacco university i'm going to

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,089
go over tap water use

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,779
for cannabis production

4
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:08,779
[Music]

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,439
when it comes to tap water or city water

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,320
a lot of growers won't utilize it for

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,359
cannabis

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,439
but however it can be a viable resource

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,599
to use for irrigating your plants and

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,920
could potentially can cause no harm

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,439
however the basics of tap water or city

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,039
water is that it's

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,880
the easiest form of water as it comes

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,960
directly from the tap so many growers

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,880
this is what they mainly have access to

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,079
however it should be tested to know what

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,239
is in the water

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,079
this will vary based on your location

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,599
and even within your town

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,280
so if you're getting town or city water

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
you can call up the water company

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,640
and typically they're doing testing

23
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,238
anyway on a regular basis

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
it's good to know what is in your water

25
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,238
because one town or one location of town

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
might have different levels in another

27
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:56,718
location

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,600
so it's important to know what actually

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,840
is in your tap water or city water

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,439
can tap water be used for cannabis

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,760
production and in some cases

32
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,118
yes and it can produce quality yields so

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,159
a lot of growers will often want to shy

34
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,560
away from this want to grow

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,359
these massive purification processes

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,280
some

37
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,719
conditions that's justified but other

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,040
conditions it's not

39
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,879
and other cases potentially could cause

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,200
plant damage so it's knowing again

41
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,640
what is in your tap water so it's a

42
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,840
general term that we give

43
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,840
to a variable source of water now when

44
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
it comes to cleaning your tap water

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,280
depending on what your tap water

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,360
contains different filter options

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,400
may be utilized to purify the water to

48
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,319
make it usable

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,359
for cannabis production and you don't

50
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,199
need to use everything here in the

51
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,519
picture but these are just a sampling

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,118
of some filtration methods mainly used

53
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,519
for kind of house filters

54
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,879
that can easily be implemented to help

55
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,118
purify that water

56
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,399
that you have coming from the tap now

57
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,000
which filter is best

58
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,439
i put best there in quotes because

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,959
filter selection should be based on what

60
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:55,758
the grower wants to filter out of the

61
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,199
water

62
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,759
different filters have different target

63
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,879
substances so the best filter is one

64
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,718
that matches the substances the best

65
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,158
just because it looks clear doesn't mean

66
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,280
it's free of contaminants just because

67
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,039
it looks dirty doesn't mean it's

68
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
absolutely horrible

69
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,079
looking at these two water sources will

70
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,759
require different methods of filtration

71
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
and lastly some filter options there's

72
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,479
carbon filters which remove chemicals

73
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,919
and heavy metals

74
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,280
and then there are sediment filters

75
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,878
which capture and moves particulate

76
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
matters such as soil and debris from the

77
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,039
water

78
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,040
if you want to learn more about either

79
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,598
carbon filters or sediment filters
