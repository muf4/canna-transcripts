00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
you may have seen these odd-looking

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:03,919
plastic pots here with all the holes in

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,960
them

4
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,720
these are called air pots and in this

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,920
i'm going to cover air pots for cannabis

[Music]

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,759
let's learn more about air pots and

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,920
related to cannabis production

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,679
so first off if you may have seen these

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,720
so what are the benefits of using

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,719
air pots well the goal is a healthy root

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,238
system and a root development while

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,359
maximizing aeration

17
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,359
and that's where they get their name

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,039
from they're called air pots because

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,600
they're increasing aeration

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,079
to the growing substrate the shape of

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,239
the sidewall minimizes root circling and

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,960
encourages the formation of fibrous root

23
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:48,799
structure

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,480
this fibrous root structure is really

25
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,799
where a lot of the absorption

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,558
occurs in the plant roots for the for

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,320
the actual plant growth

28
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,000
a fibrous root structure allows for more

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
efficient nutrient and water

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
absorption so one of the advantages of

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,599
using a pot of this

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,240
style now the type of plastic pot here

33
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,399
so

34
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,158
they are made out of typically a plastic

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,280
material at least is what we see here in

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,200
the images

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,560
and usually it's a recycled plastic

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,640
material so that's an

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,719
advantage there we're looking at the

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,200
applicability and environmentalness

41
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,158
of the container they're made to last up

42
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,079
to 10 years

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,920
even in outdoor environments so it's not

44
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,359
something you buy once and just use ones

45
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
some you can use for multiple growth

46
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,118
cycles

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,000
and potentially multiple years as well

48
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,438
the air prunes the roots so the air pot

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,959
where does that get its name from well

50
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,158
we have this aeration but why would we

51
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,118
want to have air in that

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
sidewall well as root grows towards the

53
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,239
air holes

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,359
this will prune the roots once the root

55
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,759
is terminated

56
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,359
this induces root branching so this

57
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,920
increase in root branching is what

58
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,879
causes

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,478
an increase in the total surface area

60
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,078
and really helps that plant

61
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,840
be able to scavenge for nutrients as

62
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,679
well as water

63
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,840
this increase in root branching this

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,640
increase in surface area all benefits to

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
the plant

66
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,759
when we're dealing with a limited kind

67
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,600
of container area

68
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,520
with the root mass increase through the

69
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,840
branching this allows for a greater net

70
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,480
to capture nutrients in water you just

71
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,959
have a much finer area to go out and

72
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,959
allow that plant to be readily absorbing

73
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,080
water and nutrients

74
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,920
now they have a wide usage so this

75
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,080
concept works beyond just cannabis and

76
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,439
has been shown effective in vegetables

77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,360
landscape and nursery plants as well

78
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,719
currently seem to be more popular in

79
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,360
europe where which is

80
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,000
likely due to to the developing company

81
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,519
is based

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,199
in the united kingdom this is probably a

83
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,039
wire contributing factor

84
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,238
to why these pots tend to be a little

85
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,878
bit more popular

86
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
in the european market but they're being

87
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,919
used united states and really all over

88
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,800
the world because of the benefits

89
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,318
mentioned here

90
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,719
so even though they may look a little

91
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,719
strange on first inspection

92
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,959
you can see some of the benefits and why

93
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,598
growers are using them for a variety of

94
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,598
plants
