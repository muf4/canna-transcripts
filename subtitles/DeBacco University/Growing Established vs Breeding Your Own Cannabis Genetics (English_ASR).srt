00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,318
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,720
and here we're going to look at growing

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,000
an established strain of cannabis versus

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,439
breeding your own

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,519
when we're talking about cannabis

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,759
genetics and some of the pros and some

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,960
of the cons associated with making these

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,800
decisions

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,560
so first off let's look at if you're

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,320
growing an established drain and there

11
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,160
are many established strains out there

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,640
many options for you

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,240
so what are some of the advantages of

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
utilizing the options that are available

15
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,919
to you

16
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,678
well again if you're growing a small

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,039
number of plants your options for

18
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:32,320
experimenting are minimal

19
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,239
that is where you're probably going to

20
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
favor something that's established

21
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,839
it's also great for those that are

22
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,320
starting out growing and want something

23
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,960
that don't have to work a lot at and

24
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,960
kind of

25
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,878
a set of knowns comes with growing and

26
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,719
established drain so

27
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,119
knowing what to expect as far as height

28
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,079
and flower time all that can be a great

29
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,839
advantage

30
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,079
to a grower particularly starting out

31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,079
grower also growing the same established

32
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,799
drain allows for growers to refine their

33
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,640
skills

34
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,718
keep some sort of constants throughout

35
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,399
the different growths that you may have

36
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,558
these known genetics offer the source of

37
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,599
consistency and allow you to develop a

38
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,438
plan

39
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,839
of action and allow you to refine that

40
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,879
plan with the same set of genetics

41
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,640
restraint

42
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,399
now some of the disadvantages so why

43
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320
would you may not want to go through

44
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
this route of going with an established

45
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,599
drain well you may

46
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,040
not have the characteristics you desire

47
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,319
what you're looking for

48
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,400
the end product might be the same as

49
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,199
what you can simply purchase so can you

50
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,920
justify the expense of time and money

51
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,520
to go through and develop that you know

52
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,200
use that strain when i can really just

53
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,000
go and purchase that

54
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,159
maybe at reduced cost overall and also

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,599
reduces your ability to experiment when

56
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
you have something that's known

57
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,118
you kind of have that consistency which

58
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,079
can work to your disadvantage if you're

59
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,599
looking at doing some sort of

60
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,000
experimentation

61
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,679
different plant types on there then we

62
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,118
also have the option of creating your

63
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,280
own strain

64
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,959
and the exact traits you desire to be

65
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
bred or created can

66
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,879
be an advantage of going this room it

67
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,640
could also increase your interest in the

68
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,118
growing process particularly more for

69
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
the

70
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:03,680
slightly more advanced growers that are

71
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,478
like okay i've grown the same stream

72
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,118
forever and ever

73
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,639
let me try to create my own also allows

74
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:09,199
for the potential to create something

75
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,199
unique

76
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,119
and different as you can see here with

77
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,159
maybe colorations or

78
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,120
um terpene profiles or cannabinoid

79
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,439
concentrations

80
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,719
allow those to kind of develop your own

81
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,639
maybe something a little different or

82
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,039
unique to the marketplace

83
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,318
then we also have the disadvantages so

84
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,759
also to consider these when we're

85
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,598
creating our own strain is that it can

86
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,719
be very time consuming

87
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,560
and there's also no guarantee of success

88
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,560
to create your own strain also requires

89
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,519
multiple growing locations and isolate

90
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,519
male plants

91
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,840
so this is why it's typically more

92
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,360
reserved for the advanced grower

93
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,120
so my question is what would you choose

94
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,959
would you grow

95
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,039
an established strain or would you

96
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,719
select to create your own strain

97
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,799
that's up to you to decide and as you

98
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,598
can see there's pros and cons to each

99
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,599
decision
