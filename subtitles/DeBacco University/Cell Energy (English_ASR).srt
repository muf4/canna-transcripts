1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
okay here were a look at cell energy so

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,298
whether it's a eukaryotic cell we're

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,750
talking about or prokaryotic cell

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,460
all cells neden require energy just a

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,039
reminder you curiae excels contain

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,048
membrane bound organelles prokaryotes do

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,390
not an example the prokaryotes cell

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:21,809
would like a bacteria and a eukaryotic

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,070
cell could be a plant or animal cell so

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:24,929
first off there's energy in your cells

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,820
what's it used for well it's to maintain

12
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:29,368
temperature contract your muscles

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,039
complete chemical reactions allow you to

14
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:34,409
grow and assemble larger molecules this

15
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,600
is all things that your body needs

16
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:40,140
energy for and there's list could go on

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,969
from here start with metabolism all the

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,789
chemical reactions in organisms are

19
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,070
summarized as the organisms metabolism

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,469
these metabolic activities alter

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,020
molecules in a series of steps so the

22
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,910
digestive process would be an example of

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,149
this series of steps that goes through

24
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:59,218
to break down food items energy which is

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,890
the end result is the ability to do work

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,189
and enzymes which are proteins

27
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,659
accelerate each step of this process and

28
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:10,769
enzymes are able to regulate and

29
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,760
maintain a balance supply undemanding on

30
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:16,109
starch glycogen disaccharides

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,810
monosaccharides distribution of free

32
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,789
glucose all this together is kind of

33
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,490
forming the metabolism which is a

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,100
complex set of steps that are allowing

35
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:30,030
the body to kind of generate this energy

36
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:32,009
by breaking down food items so where

37
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,618
does the energy come from all organisms

38
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,530
must produce energy from the environment

39
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:39,569
store it for future use and use it in a

40
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,310
controlled manner lose can't consume

41
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:44,250
energy and just break it all down and is

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,659
produced all ATP there's also some heat

43
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,790
that's generated there's some wastes

44
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,439
that are generated so this must be done

45
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,960
in a controlled manner trying to

46
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,519
maximize United energy where's all this

47
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,559
energy come from that we eat well

48
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,289
whether you're eating meat products

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,329
we're eating grains or eating fruits

50
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,060
reading vegetables everything starts

51
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,368
from the Sun the Sun then produces the

52
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,259
light energy that allows autotrophs to

53
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:10,020
go through the process of photosynthesis

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,150
that then allows us to produce food but

55
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,319
ultimately using that food chemical

56
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,079
energy in the food

57
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,089
we're storing it as ATP stands for

58
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:19,379
adenosine triphosphate we're gonna have

59
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,628
a separate lecture on that particular

60
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:23,518
molecule this is what it looks like it's

61
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:25,739
basically the energy currents the body's

62
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,819
energy currency it's a way to think

63
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,920
about it and that's what the body's

64
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:32,280
going to use to allow these chemical

65
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:35,250
reactions this chemical energy to be

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,658
stored and to be used for future use in

67
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,789
the body so energy from fuels I digest

68
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:43,739
large molecules into smaller ones what

69
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:46,019
occurs here were breaking bonds and

70
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,090
moving electrons from one molecule to

71
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,280
another and the electrons move they

72
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,919
carry energy and that energy is stored

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,598
in another bond we release this heat are

74
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,230
harvested again to make that body

75
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:59,548
currency ATP adenosine triphosphate so

76
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:01,198
it's where our energy from our food is

77
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:03,000
going what's happening here we're having

78
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,030
the breaking of bonds and moving of

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,729
electrons electrons carrying that energy

80
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:12,079
is what's being basically stored and to

81
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:14,429
be used for later purposes in the body

82
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,900
now good kind of slide to kind of look

83
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,989
at which may initially look a little

84
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,030
confusing is this slide here we're

85
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,709
talking about oxidation and reduction

86
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,769
reactions and this is just the very

87
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:29,069
basics of this so something is oxidized

88
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:31,680
it loses an electron so molecule one

89
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:35,068
here is losing an electron so it's

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,219
oxidized then electron with its negative

91
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:41,638
charge is being transferred here to our

92
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:44,310
number two this is gaining an electron

93
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,259
therefore it's reduced keep in mind all

94
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,049
that trends have a negative charge so

95
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:51,658
for gaining electron is this will be

96
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,329
reduced so the kind of the trick to

97
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:56,638
remember this is Leo says go into the

98
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,329
line o stands for is Leo losing

99
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,180
electrons oxidation says Kirk ger since

100
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,199
we're gaining electrons is reduced so if

101
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,540
we know all that trends have a negative

102
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,609
charge if we're gaining electrons we're

103
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:11,638
going to be reduced so in order to gain

104
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:14,699
an electron another atom or molecule

105
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,879
here needs to lose an electron so this

106
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:20,470
would be the oxidizer component and this

107
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,620
would be the reduced

108
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,750
so this is an oxidation and reduction

109
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,670
it's referred to the transfer of

110
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,990
electrons it makes that a little

111
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,360
counterintuitive but if you're getting

112
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,790
electrons your reduced if you're losing

113
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,129
the electrons you become oxidized or is

114
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,860
sickly giving a more positive native

115
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:40,569
charge so this kind of helps you just

116
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,910
understand a little bit what goes on in

117
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:45,060
our cells nor metabolism so cells gain

118
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,060
energy
