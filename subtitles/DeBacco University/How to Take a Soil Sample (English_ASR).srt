1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,318
here on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,359
going to go over how to properly take a

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:06,960
soil sample

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,638
because it's very important that you

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,320
follow the right protocols

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,919
so that you're sending a quality sample

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,480
to the lab that you'll be basing your

8
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:20,800
results from

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,320
[Music]

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
all right here i'm going to go over the

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,640
steps on how to take a proper soil

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:26,159
sample

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,439
and then walking you through the process

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,039
myself as well hope you enjoy the video

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,119
well first off why would we be taking a

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,760
soil test and a soil test

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,879
can help tell the chemistry of the soil

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,359
that cannot be seen

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,359
based on only a visual inspection it can

20
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,719
also aid in deciding what amendments

21
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,000
need to be added to an

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,840
area with the proper sample can end up

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
saving the grower a lot of money so

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,199
it's important to not just take any

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480
random soil sample to be sure that

26
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:53,039
you're going about it in the proper

27
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:54,398
method

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,079
because you're going to be basing

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,480
hopefully a lot of

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,920
amendments and a lot of end kind of

31
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,159
processes from here

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,679
based on the results of that soil test

33
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,518
so take a quality sample

34
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,879
it'll pay off in the end for you and

35
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,359
your plants

36
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,719
so how to ensure a good sample well the

37
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,719
goal is to get a field

38
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,478
representative sample this is

39
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,118
accomplished by collecting many sub

40
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:16,478
samples

41
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,239
that are put together to create an

42
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,920
average sample you don't just want to

43
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,559
sample from one area and send that off

44
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,719
to the lab

45
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,879
you want to get a collection of samples

46
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,959
do not sample only in that one area as

47
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,798
simply put this will not produce results

48
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,039
representative of the field

49
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,320
as will only provide information about a

50
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,360
point in that

51
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,758
whole field area many point occurrences

52
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,239
can

53
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,000
many point clearances can occur that can

54
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,078
lead to non-representative

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,118
results so it's an example if i only

56
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:44,078
sample from this area what could have

57
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,438
happened in that area

58
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,438
well there could have been a fertilizer

59
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,959
spill it could be in the vehicle parked

60
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,319
or a tractor parked in that lot

61
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,879
there could be animal droppings there

62
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,199
could be uneven drainage in that area

63
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,399
a whole potential host of reasons which

64
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,079
is why i don't want to stick from one

65
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,159
area might take from multiple regions

66
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,798
collect them together to get a good

67
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
field representative sample so what

68
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,000
equipment do i need

69
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,759
and this can vary depending on your

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
exact sample method but in general you

71
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,159
need a map

72
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,759
it's good to know what area or areas

73
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,639
you'll be sampling and where each is

74
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,399
located

75
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,919
and what each is referred to as as far

76
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,640
as naming and labeling

77
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,318
your sample a shovel spade or coring

78
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,958
device i'll go over some of those

79
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,000
the goal is to collect a consistent soil

80
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,080
profile

81
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
you may want to avoid rusty iron tools

82
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,640
as this could artificially inflate the

83
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
iron

84
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,159
numbers just as a side note need a

85
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,878
bucket or some sort of holding device

86
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,799
this is where the

87
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,120
soil subsamples will be collected and

88
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,640
then mixed to ensure isolated samples

89
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,519
the bucket may be lined with a plastic

90
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,359
trash bag

91
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,719
to avoid any potential contamination

92
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
allows it to label that bag

93
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,080
seal it up and then you can move along

94
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:49,919
with that soil

95
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,519
small plastic bags here is where the

96
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,159
final representative sample will be

97
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,599
placed

98
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,840
and it should be double bagged when sent

99
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,199
to the lab and be sure you label each

100
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,759
bag with the name

101
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,039
of the field or identification name as

102
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,199
well as your own name

103
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,158
and then a marker to label label label

104
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,759
to make sure

105
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,519
you don't end up with all bags of soil

106
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,598
in the end and not remember where any

107
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,080
were exactly from

108
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,759
now where to collect the samples so this

109
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,200
uh we see here

110
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,120
how do we go about collecting samples

111
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,119
some different methods here well

112
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,039
first question is how large of an area

113
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,560
and really in short it depends on where

114
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,318
you go about collecting samples

115
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,878
fields that will be sampled individually

116
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,039
but if areas are seen to be different

117
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,560
there should be separate samples and

118
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,400
labeled separately as well

119
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,920
it could be field one good field one bad

120
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,120
it could be a good and bad area of the

121
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:39,119
field a high area in a low area

122
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
a wet area in a dry area for large

123
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,759
fields it's advised to break them into

124
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,000
smaller

125
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,439
subsections such as field four upper

126
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,519
field four or lower field four

127
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,680
north field for south feels for east and

128
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,158
west something a way to kind of separate

129
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,480
those

130
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,000
to create little smaller areas um just

131
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,438
to give you an idea of what might be

132
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,080
going on in one part of the field

133
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,438
compared to another now how deep do you

134
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,799
sample

135
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,799
well the goal really is six to nine

136
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,438
inches deep and this is considered to be

137
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,120
the main

138
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,878
root zone so you have to go through and

139
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
measure it you can measure some tools of

140
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,598
measurements on it

141
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,039
idea how deep your spade is put a little

142
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,959
marker line on it

143
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,400
but six to nine inches deep that's your

144
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,160
goal

145
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,079
now sampling methods so here we're going

146
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,880
to look at the spade method we see some

147
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,840
nice

148
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,360
uh pictures located right here first

149
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,000
part of course is to clear the surface

150
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,919
litter

151
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,959
uh and plant growth from the sound from

152
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,079
the spot you want to start with just a

153
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,000
flat soil line

154
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,359
you want to dig a hole about as wide as

155
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
your spade and as deep

156
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,199
as the layers you're going to sample

157
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
then with the spade tip place

158
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,960
one inch outside of the edge of the hole

159
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,839
cut down and remove a slice of one side

160
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,519
of the wall

161
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,959
so here we see the area cut a little

162
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,319
hole there we're going right down we're

163
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,039
cutting a one

164
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,319
slice thickness by six to nine inches

165
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,479
long area

166
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,478
keeping that slice at the blade of the

167
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,478
spade use a trial knife or stick to cut

168
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,319
away the sides and slice

169
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,319
leaving the center section about one

170
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,839
inch wide so we kind of keep that area

171
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,599
you can cut it down a little bit or you

172
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,879
can just use that same whole sample

173
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,160
there

174
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,399
ideally this one inch by one inch

175
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,240
vertical section your soil is your sub

176
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,839
sample so that would really cut down on

177
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,079
the amount instead of having one area be

178
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,079
so

179
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,359
large you can cut it down or you can

180
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,279
just use the whole thing

181
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
for using a larger pail you want to

182
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,279
place all these subsamples into a

183
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,038
plastic container mix them together well

184
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,319
and then remove about two cups or one

185
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,319
pint of this mixture

186
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,439
this is your composite sample to send to

187
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,240
the laboratory for

188
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,879
analysis and this is an ex explanation

189
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
here

190
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,279
looking at the spade method then we also

191
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,160
get into the pv

192
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,959
pvc pipe sampling method uh where we're

193
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
looking at

194
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,198
the same thing can be applied to a pvc

195
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,519
pipe or also a coring device as well

196
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,680
so so when we're looking at our core

197
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,599
device or pvc sample

198
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,800
acquire two foot length of inch and a

199
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
half pvc pipe

200
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
mark six and nine inches on the pipe

201
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,478
pound it into the ground

202
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
at least to the six inch mark but try to

203
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,918
get to the nine inch mark remove the

204
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
core dislodge into the pail and repeat

205
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,959
this

206
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,160
six to nine times this now the advantage

207
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,719
of the coring device

208
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,160
is it's typically stainless steel and it

209
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,680
makes it a lot easier

210
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
but if you don't want to get one of the

211
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,000
kind of higher end stainless steel

212
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,239
methods

213
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,839
if you've got a sledge hammer and two

214
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
foot length of inch and a half pipe

215
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,198
you can go through and do this same

216
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,638
exact method realize with the pipe

217
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,319
you'll be getting more samples so again

218
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,478
that five gallon pail is advised

219
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,759
mix it all together take your subsample

220
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,399
label label label

221
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
send it off to the lab now preparing

222
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,038
your

223
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
soil sample for analysis in the sense

224
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,279
that you want to mix your subsamples

225
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,839
together

226
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,638
you've collected into one large sample

227
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,079
this is

228
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,918
too much to send to the lab you want to

229
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,079
take only a two cup sample

230
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,519
from what you have collected as an

231
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,639
estimation if you're in the field how do

232
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,399
i estimate two cups

233
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,240
well let's kind of think about what two

234
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,318
hands uh can hold there

235
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,439
that would be the consideration of about

236
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,280
two cups

237
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,360
place that soil should be placed into a

238
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,198
labeled bag double bag the sample

239
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
include your paperwork and send it off

240
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,960
to the lab

241
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,079
and as i mentioned before do not forget

242
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,839
the paperwork

243
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,359
for your own sake as well as for the

244
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,359
sanity of the lab workers

245
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,960
be sure to clearly label everything and

246
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,479
you also want to double check to make

247
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,120
sure you've also included the

248
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,560
necessary paperwork with your sample

249
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,519
don't fill it out and then back

250
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,000
everything up and

251
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,680
forget to send it off so make sure you

252
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
have that paperwork included

253
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,759
with your sample in any payment as well

254
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,840
that might be required

255
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,960
so with this you want to make sure

256
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,959
follow this method

257
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,079
sounds like a little bit of kind of a

258
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,318
laborious

259
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,839
task but in the end this will definitely

260
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,439
save you a lot of work and allow you to

261
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,839
make informed decisions

262
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,839
to maximize your plant yield overall

263
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,120
all right so here i am in the field i'm

264
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,038
going to go over how to take a

265
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,879
soil sample with a couple different

266
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,240
methods now the goal is going to be the

267
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,680
same the end result that we're going to

268
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,319
get is going to be the same amount of

269
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,319
soil

270
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,840
field representative so while i'm in a

271
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,360
large corn field here

272
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,119
we're going i'm going to show you an

273
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,160
area at one point but we'd be

274
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,800
replicating this

275
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,720
soil sampling technique throughout the

276
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,439
entire field to get a representative

277
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,759
sample

278
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,038
and there's two main methods one there's

279
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,360
a soil core method

280
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,639
so in this example here i've got an

281
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,400
actual soil core

282
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,319
this is the probably the you know

283
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,239
easiest way if you're going to be doing

284
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,439
a lot of samples this is by far the way

285
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,918
i would recommend

286
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,199
you're going to take your soil core this

287
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,198
area here is about

288
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,120
six to nine inches depth is what you

289
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,879
want the reason why you want that to be

290
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,000
that deep is that is basically the root

291
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,599
profile

292
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,038
now that what makes the soil core so

293
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,759
nice is it stainless steel

294
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,199
it's all inclusive you don't have that

295
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,599
you can take a little simple

296
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,278
inch and a half piece of pvc pipe put

297
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,800
that in the ground mark it with that six

298
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,320
to nine inches your goal is to get to at

299
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,639
least six inches

300
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
if you if you can if that goes well go

301
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,039
up to nine inches

302
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,159
you don't want to really go much more

303
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,360
than that because that's really your

304
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,639
root zone profile there

305
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
you would take this you'd pound this

306
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,958
into the ground and you take that

307
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,159
core and put it into your bag right here

308
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,079
i've got a bag

309
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,838
over a five gallon pail to make sure

310
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,600
everything is consistent

311
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,040
i've also got the measuring i've got

312
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
some bags i got gloves

313
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,079
i can take this out when i get my soil

314
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,439
sample and label this

315
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,360
because i'm in one field here we might

316
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,880
be going through doing multiple fields

317
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,120
so keep that in mind that keeping

318
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,559
everything labeled is very important and

319
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,600
that's a great way to do that

320
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,958
in addition the bag also keeps any

321
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,080
contaminants that might be within the

322
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,039
soil in the bucket

323
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,399
separate so again you could use a pvc

324
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,278
pipe i like the inch and a half because

325
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,120
it comes out

326
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,360
relatively easy you're kind of going

327
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,600
through and able to dislodge it much

328
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,039
easier if it was a smaller diameter pipe

329
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,440
but since we've got the official soil

330
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,759
core here it operates in the same method

331
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,279
so here's my sample area and here's my

332
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,159
corn plants plants or whatever

333
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,600
and put that here on the soil and then

334
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,399
i'm going to push that down

335
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,320
to about that mark i give it a little

336
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,120
rotate and when i go to pull this out

337
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
you're going to notice

338
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,800
i've got my nice core right here

339
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,800
now with this core that i have i'm going

340
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,838
to be taking that and adding that to

341
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,599
the bucket right here so what's great

342
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,279
about the official soil probe is that

343
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
because it's got this half cut

344
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,480
makes it really easy to go through and

345
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,919
now replicate this

346
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,159
however i realize not everyone has a

347
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,759
soil core so what's something that you

348
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,639
may have around

349
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,399
well you may have a regular spade and

350
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,559
you can do the exact same method

351
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
so in this area here what we want to do

352
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,319
is we want to make a

353
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,639
we want to make a hole so we go through

354
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,040
get our spade

355
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,000
now we're going to remove chunk of soil

356
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,639
now we don't want to take this

357
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
as our soil sample what i'm doing is i'm

358
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,319
cutting a

359
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,040
hole down here got some earthworms

360
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,040
always nice to see

361
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,360
and i'm going down that same about six

362
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,959
to nine inches but with my spade what

363
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
makes this why is i want to speed with

364
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,439
this

365
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,519
flat point here is i'm going to go

366
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,240
through now and not take this soil as my

367
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,399
sample

368
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,360
there's a profile here i'll take my

369
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,559
speed take about an

370
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:03,200
inch away from that go straight down

371
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,958
and take that out so what essentially

372
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,879
i've got now

373
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:10,719
is that one inch profile of the soil

374
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,159
now you could take this entire sample

375
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,440
put it in there you're going to be doing

376
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,559
a lot of samples i don't want to carry

377
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
around that much

378
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,319
weight of soil because the bucket gets

379
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,838
heavy you can go through and you can

380
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,399
remove a portion of that

381
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,839
as long as you're consistent and take

382
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,078
only maybe the center portion there so

383
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,600
you can take out some of this

384
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,359
keep in mind you want to keep that side

385
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,959
of that center region

386
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,320
why that's going to be your consistent

387
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,599
soil there because you got a lot of

388
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,600
enough moisture in the soil here

389
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,319
take that essentially that core that

390
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,319
profile

391
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,278
add that to our bag go back through

392
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,440
refill this in so we don't trip over it

393
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,879
in the middle of the night

394
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,200
and then go through and replicate that

395
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,278
again and again when we're done

396
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,680
we've got all of our soil we don't need

397
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,720
to send the whole full bag of soil

398
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,319
we only need approximately

399
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,720
if we mix everything up from all of our

400
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
cores

401
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,439
get a good kind of representative sample

402
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,559
and what we need to send to the lab is

403
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
basically what

404
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,239
two hands can hold this is all the soil

405
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,519
sample we need we want to send them a

406
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,560
five gallon pail

407
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,159
we also don't want to send them a

408
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,679
thimble amount we want all that

409
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,519
basically two hands uh

410
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,879
can hold and that's the volume of soil

411
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,839
we wanna add

412
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,078
i recommend just a regular little lunch

413
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,800
bag

414
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,879
when you get your old soil mixed up and

415
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,838
you get it nice kind of

416
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,879
together you want to remove anything

417
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,720
large that you see them this

418
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,759
the lab will screen that out but why

419
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,160
send it to them you know they're going

420
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,399
to screen that out anyway

421
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,439
visually what this generally looks like

422
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,759
it's approximately this much

423
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,360
label the bag double bag it and as

424
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,720
always when you're sending this

425
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,720
make sure you also include the

426
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,120
appropriate paperwork the lab will thank

427
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,560
you

428
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
and those help you ensure that you're

429
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,278
getting accurate results and they know

430
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,518
exactly

431
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:01,039
where that soil who that soil belongs to

432
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,039
and where the results need to go to

433
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,879
all right so we're going to use this

434
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,360
field as a representative field for

435
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,360
taking soil samples so when we look at

436
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,680
the field overall we don't see any major

437
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,600
like really low spots or any dips so we

438
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,120
can do this to normal random sampling

439
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,800
so this here is going to be my first

440
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,120
point to randomly sample

441
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,838
and let's go through and see where else

442
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,440
i would sample

443
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,480
this particular field i'd also take a

444
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,480
sample from here

445
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,440
i would take another sample from here

446
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:40,799
and i take another sample from here

447
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,320
and another one from here and this looks

448
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,799
like a good spot i'll take another one

449
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
from here

450
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,838
and another sample right from here
