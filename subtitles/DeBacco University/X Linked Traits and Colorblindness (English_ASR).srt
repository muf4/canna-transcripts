1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,740
okay looking at x-linked traits and

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:10,080
colorblindness which is directly related

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:13,710
to the X chromosome so this excellent is

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,388
basically sex-linked inheritance the

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,429
Harringtons is determined by genes and

6
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:21,239
the sex chromosomes females have two

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:25,140
copies of the X chromosome and the males

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:27,570
have one copy of X and one copy of Y the

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,719
reason why this is important is the X

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,359
chromosomes can contain about 2500 genes

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,089
while the puny little Y chromosome only

12
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,460
contains about 15 so excellent genes are

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,989
only found on the X chromosome and are

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,420
typically passed from mothers to sons

15
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:45,089
never master Danford in males since

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,879
there's no y counterpart so we can

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,000
almost disregard the Y so if you're a

18
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,439
male you have one X chromosome meaning

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,009
whatever genes you have on that are

20
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,808
expressed in evidence the females have

21
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,019
two x's meaning if there's a defect in

22
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,549
one they kind of like a backup copy

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,989
where the nails simply do not

24
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,530
that's why males were more likely to be

25
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:09,359
colorblind than females so this x-linked

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,070
dominant recessive trait so males are XY

27
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,469
a single copy of the X chromosome

28
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:14,938
females have two copies males only get

29
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,009
an X chromosome from their mother

30
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,379
females get an X chromosome from each

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,969
parent both mom and dad it kind of shows

32
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:25,170
it here here's our two x's and the

33
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:27,150
female our X and our Y from the nail so

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,009
x-linked dominant recessive males only

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,420
get X chromosomes from their mother it's

36
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,659
the only place that they can get it cuz

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,299
dad can cannot give two x's to their

38
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,299
daughters but their sons get one X from

39
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,950
mom and the Y from their dad now when

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,530
we're looking at our chromosomes we look

41
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,250
down here if it's an X and a Y we know

42
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,079
this is the map for a male if this was

43
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,719
two x's we know this would be the a map

44
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:54,059
for a female females get the X

45
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,500
chromosome from each parent they're more

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,200
likely to show x-linked dominant

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,599
disorders because they have essentially

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,490
two copies so adherence of an x-linked

49
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,589
dominant mutation from infected mother a

50
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,718
woman with an x-linked dominant disorder

51
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,659
has 50% chance of having an affected

52
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,789
daughter or son with each pregnancy and

53
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,859
that shows here we have our affected as

54
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:17,069
the white again

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,070
only has one X in the puny little Y sons

56
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,129
will get that one X from mom and they're

57
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:25,889
only extra mom where daughters will get

58
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:30,359
an X from mom and an X from dad

59
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:33,269
so as a result the odds are in this case

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,160
here the affected son and daughters have

61
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:40,680
a 50% chance of having it affected gene

62
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:43,530
now far excellent dominant with the

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,390
affected father being the case the sons

64
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,069
will always be safe because in this case

65
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:48,149
they have to get their extra mom and mom

66
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,569
is unaffected

67
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,879
the daughters however they will all be

68
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,859
basically affected by this because they

69
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,959
have to get one of those X's from dad in

70
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,510
this case it's a dominant x-linked they

71
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,219
will all Express that tree so that's

72
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:04,519
good in the bad of how excellent

73
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:06,990
dominant recessive disorders

74
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,689
another example here just put it into

75
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,969
some colors same basic pattern as before

76
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,409
I want you to take a look at these you

77
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,740
can pause the video to see if you can

78
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:18,539
kind of trace and see how this plays out

79
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,269
remembering that females get an extra

80
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:24,979
mom and dad males have to get their ex

81
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:27,120
from mom and this again shows a next

82
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:29,129
dominant affected and mother here in

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,509
this case represent I read and just see

84
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:35,189
how that kind of traces out X recessive

85
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:38,159
carry your mother remember carrier will

86
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:40,560
only have on half and how that affects

87
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,680
both sons and daughters sons could be

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,140
unaffected or simply affected there's no

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,250
middle ground in this case females could

90
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,449
be unaffected or a carrier in this case

91
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,340
so that's it the colorblind fun part

92
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:55,619
here so what is colorblindness so just

93
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,090
the basics it's an admirable condition

94
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,830
characterized by the inability to

95
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,780
clearly distinguish different colors

96
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,660
from the spectrum there were G Biff

97
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,400
spectrum difficulty mild to severe do

98
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,419
two cones located on the redness from

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,640
the back of your eye you have these

100
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,479
photoreceptors their retina they're

101
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,449
called cones

102
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,548
they're receptive to color rods or see

103
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:16,829
more than just black and white this is

104
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,978
an X chromosome link tree now we're

105
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,769
going to focus on humans what dogs don't

106
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:25,319
have the same cones that we do so not to

107
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:28,490
disappoint you but if phyto there you

108
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:31,129
have his favorite red toys a little

109
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,470
fire-engine or something that's red and

110
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:35,629
you're showing them the red color he

111
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,900
can't see the red he's gonna see it as

112
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:41,449
this kind of greyish off yellowish color

113
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:44,839
he'll recognize the shape for you is the

114
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:47,060
red fire hydrant but he's not gonna see

115
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:49,668
the red color so if you're looking to

116
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,560
buy dog toys you want to stick with the

117
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:54,589
blues or the yellows because that's what

118
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,870
they can see green not so much Purple's

119
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:58,848
also not so great Reds are pretty poor

120
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,860
just based on the cones that they have

121
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:02,689
in their eyes

122
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,069
so in here too colorblindness again

123
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:07,759
we're looking at excellent

124
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:11,030
so carriers in this case will always be

125
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,150
female by the circles males will either

126
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:18,589
be unaffected or colorblind because they

127
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:20,109
only have one X chromosome so close by

128
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:23,628
this house would this look worldwide

129
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,060
affects about one in 12 men or one in

130
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:27,379
200 women and in total about four and

131
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,990
half percent of the world population is

132
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:31,158
colorblind with most being male this is

133
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,710
kind of interesting this kind of gives

134
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:38,240
you an idea of the American flag there's

135
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:40,579
one two three four and five and how

136
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,500
people with different missing different

137
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:44,959
colors would look at the American flag

138
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,399
now if you are colorblind yourself it's

139
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,918
not going to be able to appreciate the

140
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,339
differences presented here and some of

141
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:52,879
the tests so this would be perfect color

142
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:55,158
blind test

143
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,158
now this by no means is a medical way of

144
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:59,959
diagnosing what color blindness you may

145
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,699
or may not have but you can look at

146
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,318
these and you should see potentially

147
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:06,199
some numbers in these some might be

148
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,789
easier to tell than others you're

149
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,460
welcome to go through and take a look at

150
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:12,318
the mall and see what you see I am gonna

151
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:13,519
reveal the answers so if you want to

152
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,310
take a pause this would be the time to

153
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,718
pause it okay for those looking for the

154
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,968
answers here we go

155
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:21,560
I know it's the ones on the bottom here

156
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:24,468
we're squealing lions this is kind of a

157
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,569
mess of squiggly lines some people have

158
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:29,389
an easier time seeing some than the

159
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:30,830
others I'll flip back for a second some

160
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,610
people say that the twelve is really

161
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:38,198
easy to see up here others 242 some

162
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,520
considers that 71 or is it a 74 and 74

163
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,300
so you can just get an idea here of the

164
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,310
answers

165
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,829
for those playing along to at home this

166
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,600
is another example here today right now

167
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:49,939
if you're seeing numbers you're not in

168
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,850
good shape I should be seeing shapes in

169
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:53,990
this one because animal shapes and if

170
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,170
you'd like to you can pause the video

171
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,090
now before I reveal the answers so if

172
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,590
you're looking to compare the two this

173
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:05,089
is what you should see kind of a bear in

174
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:06,109
this region with kind of maybe a male in

175
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:10,189
the foreground a female in the

176
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:12,620
background a fox in this region kind of

177
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:14,120
a squirrel and a rabbit over here just

178
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,870
giving the idea what you just actually

179
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,860
should be seeing in that image so

180
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,870
colorblindness it's a condition affects

181
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,910
men more than women heritage genetic

182
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,180
trait hiring Caucasian males and any

183
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,280
other group great video here explaining

184
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,459
and showing a little bit more we found

185
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:34,189
right here for some descriptions just to

186
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:36,109
give you an idea of you know what causes

187
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:38,600
colorblindness and does your read look

188
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,939
the same is what I interpreted as red

189
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,340
there's your green looks the same green

190
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:46,430
is most often the color most people have

191
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:49,009
trouble with and just to end here colors

192
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:52,519
of the rainbow even the idea of try to

193
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,110
give you some examples of some different

194
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,069
types of colorblindness remember

195
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,370
colorblindness doesn't mean you just

196
00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:00,349
can't see all the colors there's

197
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,870
different types of colorblindness

198
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,060
and depending on what how defective your

199
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,540
cones may be or what mutations may have

200
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:11,030
occurred affects the amount of colors

201
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,010
that you may be able to see and how your

202
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:15,709
cones in the back of your eye in the

203
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:18,889
retina interpret the colors and keep in

204
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:21,019
mind your dog there even in the best

205
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,839
division he's not technically colorblind

206
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:26,750
he just lacks the cones to see red sees

207
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,609
definitely more of the yellows in blues

208
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,149
there hopefully this was helpful and you

209
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,150
learned a little bit
