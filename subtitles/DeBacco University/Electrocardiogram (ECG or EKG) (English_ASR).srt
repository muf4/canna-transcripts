1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,160
okay here we're look at an

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:08,369
electrocardiogram sometimes abbreviated

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,870
ECG or EKG we're gonna get appreciation

4
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:11,910
for these little peaks and valleys and

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,939
what these actually mean and how they

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,190
indicate what's normal for a properly

7
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,149
beating heart

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,500
so starting the interests in general

9
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,379
like other muscles the heart muscle

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,899
contracts when stimulated and in EKG

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,969
shows hearts electricity electrical

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,339
activity so it's electricity actually

13
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,979
moving through the heart we're looking

14
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,210
at the heart cells depolarizing and

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,250
repolarizing and that's what we're

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,620
seeing with these little kind of peaks

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,269
and valleys they're all labeled and

18
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,250
we're gonna go over each section and

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,170
what it actually means this is a good

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,549
kind of general summary we have

21
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,100
something called a P wave that's a

22
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:50,009
depolarization of the atria and responds

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,530
to the SA node triggering then the PR

24
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,000
interval here is a delay of the AV node

25
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,289
a lot of the filling of the ventricles

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,579
the QRS complex is a depolarization of

27
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,739
the ventricles triggering the main

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,049
pumping contractions notice it's a big

29
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,658
peak here it's a main contraction phase

30
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,700
here the STT region it's beginning of

31
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,219
the ventricle depolarization it should

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,920
be generally flat and the T V T wave

33
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:14,879
here is the ventricle repolarization so

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,159
we're gonna look at these in just a

35
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,649
little bit more detail but you can see

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,900
these distinctive regions are all

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,990
labeled and so are certain segments and

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,640
complexes so to kind of give that into

39
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:28,530
motion we look at camera peaks and

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,209
valleys this had no presents it a little

41
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,939
bit fast but you're welcome to pause it

42
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:33,868
here but the heart beat originates at

43
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:39,118
the SA node

44
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:42,079
it's the sy Sano atrial node was

45
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:45,599
abbreviated SA node and this is

46
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:47,548
spontaneously depolarizes this wave of

47
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,739
depolarization spreads to the atria

48
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,259
causing them to contract so we see that

49
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,478
an initial kind of signal here right

50
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,090
there going right to here this second

51
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:00,629
portion right here this is the AV node

52
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,368
or the atrial ventricular node this

53
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,500
passes the ventricles via the bundle of

54
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,450
his it is conducted rapidly over the

55
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,090
surface of the ventricles in the

56
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,699
Purkinje fibers as we see here ventricle

57
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,530
contraction empties the heart and if we

58
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:15,750
notice here are a

59
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,550
she are contracting first and then

60
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,430
followed by both of our ventricles

61
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,680
contracting this is a diagram of the

62
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,750
heart with all the muscle removed just

63
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,719
looking basically the conductive nerve

64
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,430
fibers here in the heart again it's kind

65
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,109
of shows the waves that are occurring

66
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,010
simultaneously with the beating of the

67
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,650
heart now under staying an ECG here the

68
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:39,899
p-wave where the atria are full of blood

69
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,830
and the SA node fires that's what we see

70
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,510
here the P wave the P hues segment is a

71
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,790
time it takes the signal travel from the

72
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:49,649
SA node to the AV node so a little bit

73
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:50,879
of a delay there that's important we

74
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,280
don't want the whole country heart

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,009
contracting at the same time continuing

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,349
on that wave QRS complex and that's the

77
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,239
firing of the AV node the contraction of

78
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,530
the ventricles keep in mind the

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,330
ventricles have to pump blood all into

80
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,959
the lungs in the body that's why we see

81
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,969
this large peak there the R wave is the

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,909
main massive ventricles contracting so

83
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:13,439
specifically within the QRS complex that

84
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,449
our wave is the main mass of the

85
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,340
ventricles contracting followed by the

86
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:20,578
ST segment located here

87
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,159
it's the interval between the ventricle

88
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:25,829
depolarization and repolarization this

89
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,939
is a flat region paying that much has

90
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,209
happened in a little bit of a delay

91
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,739
process leading to the T wave which is

92
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,409
the repolarization of the ventricles

93
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,939
mathilde slight increase there in

94
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:37,349
addition to the description I'm giving

95
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,069
you there's also a couple other videos

96
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:42,629
here that you're welcome to look at

97
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:45,090
these electrical signals again put in

98
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:48,000
kind of a picture into colorization of

99
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,069
the wave we see the SA node here it's

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,769
our first little bone then we're having

101
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:55,289
our impulse going to the AV node that's

102
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,849
that flat line here then we see the

103
00:03:55,289 --> 00:04:00,120
bundle branches carrying the signal that

104
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,829
signals being passed down here good all

105
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,180
the reaching all into the heart apex to

106
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,129
the bottom of the heart let's see that

107
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,129
right here and then when our ventricles

108
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:10,889
contract this entire area that's our big

109
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:12,989
peak here so again tying in what's going

110
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:15,328
on with the actual heart with the actual

111
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,250
sections of this wave our very important

112
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,350
putting this in a little bit of more of

113
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,220
a circular form you can see here it's

114
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,050
the same basic pqrst sequence this just

115
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,780
put it in a circular form because again

116
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,600
it does reoccur again and again

117
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:31,489
so some representations here I'll

118
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,600
provide it in a circle giving that

119
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:38,269
cyclical nature and we could see the

120
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:43,910
exact same sequence again tied in with

121
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:49,219
the PQRS and t-waves and segments of the

122
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:51,470
cardiac cycle lastly I think you're

123
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,180
becoming more popular more prevalent we

124
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,330
have seen this sign that airports are

125
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,759
public areas called AED these stands for

126
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,439
automated external defibrillator it's a

127
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,930
portable electronic device that applies

128
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,000
electricity which stops the arrhythmia

129
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,100
allowing the heart to re-establish an

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,350
effective rhythm what's great about

131
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,450
these is they're fully automated with

132
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,070
simple audio and visual commands and

133
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:16,399
they're designed so basically anyone can

134
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:18,139
pick them up however their use of them

135
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,810
is being taught in many first aid and

136
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:22,370
CPR classes so if you've gone to one of

137
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,589
those classes you may have had

138
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,990
experience with these but they are in

139
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:28,729
very public areas and they do have a

140
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,819
very stepwise walk you through the

141
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:33,200
process sequence here so you may have

142
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:34,639
been familiar with these and this is the

143
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,918
way we could restart the heart if

144
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,629
someone did have the potential heart

145
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,629
issue in a public area
