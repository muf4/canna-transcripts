1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,198
sometimes it's important to not overlook

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,720
simplicity

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,399
here we're going to look at diluted

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:16,079
irrigation tank for

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:18,000
cannabis production

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,278
if you're looking to add fertilizer into

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,118
your irrigation water

8
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,640
well simply diluting it in an irrigation

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,198
tank and pumping it out to the plants

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,320
can be an effective way so here we're

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,400
going to cover using

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,399
fertilizer in a diluted irrigation tank

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,199
for cannabis production

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,799
so this is by far the simplest method so

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,079
if a grower is irrigating from a tank

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,759
anyway this makes sense

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,480
and is an easy method for adding

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,238
fertilizer it only requires a water tank

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,159
and a water pump but i put even maybe

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,679
you can potentially eating gravity feed

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,799
it to plants if you're using drip

22
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,519
irrigation

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,280
so very simple it doesn't require a lot

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,760
of parts and typically parts growers

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,000
might be utilizing anyway

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,119
so looking at the two options here or

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,159
two components that you would

28
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,320
potentially need

29
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,000
with a tank in the pump tank should be

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,399
blocked from light to prevent algal

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
growth

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,000
as it can be increased due to the

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
addition of diluted nutrients in the

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
water so we can see here somebody

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
putting

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,439
black tarp in some way blocking the

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
light spray painting the tank

38
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,599
in some way can also help potentially

39
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,679
heat it and also prevent

40
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,959
algae from growing on the inside then we

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,400
have the pump to make sure the

42
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,599
components can handle the salts or

43
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,080
nutrients that will be added to the

44
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,438
water

45
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,599
so you're not wearing out any internal

46
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,679
components as this may cause corrosion

47
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,438
and or wearing out the pump parts faster

48
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
than if it just was normally with

49
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,519
irrigation water

50
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,200
then it does require some calculations

51
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,599
so it's not just a kind of mix and let

52
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
go

53
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,118
the amount of fertilizer to add should

54
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,879
be added to the tank and allowed to mix

55
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,319
fully with the water you just want to go

56
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,759
in through and splash in your nutrients

57
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,679
and just let it go

58
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,840
recirculating that mixing that up in

59
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,200
some way is definitely advised

60
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,960
you won't have the fertilizer set on the

61
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,399
tank either especially if it sits for a

62
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,559
period of time as this could increase

63
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,478
the odds of plant damage especially if

64
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,200
the water is being applied

65
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,200
to the leaves or via head irrigation

66
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,478
methods overhead irrigation methods

67
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
also if you're not using the whole tank

68
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,000
and it sells to the bottom your plants

69
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,759
could get a much concentrated more

70
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,758
concentrated dose than you'd want

71
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,199
and that could also cause plant damage

72
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,279
so again keep a couple of these

73
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,399
few things simple things in mind might

74
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,800
be a set of

75
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,719
you already have in place go through add

76
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,800
it you don't need any special equipment

77
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,800
and the plants will thank you
