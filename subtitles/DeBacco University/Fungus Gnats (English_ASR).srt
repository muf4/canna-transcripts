1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,810
here we're gonna be learning a little

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,088
bit more about fungus gnats me see it

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,790
zoomed in picture of one here Jesus is

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,500
about three millimeters long just to

5
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:13,410
give you an idea of the size of these

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,570
fungus gnats so often discovered in

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,698
plants or Moop that jostle effect you

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,160
can kind of see them moving about at

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,630
that point how the larvae is about two

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,329
to four millimeters long and half

11
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:27,118
translucent bodies and blackheads you

12
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,409
see the image here they also have a poor

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,839
ability to fly even though they do have

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,140
some wings portably the fly meaning they

15
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,090
can't fly very long distances where to

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,859
look which is key for the identification

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,200
for these is inspecting the roots for

18
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:43,170
dark spots we can see the evidence of

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,690
one right here and two here and one guy

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,700
over in this area and a bunch kind of

21
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,019
located here they're commonly found in

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,750
the growing media since they infest

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,270
infest plant roots close to the soil

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,670
surface so they don't dig down very far

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,050
they are close to that surface area and

26
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,059
that's important we're looking to try to

27
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:01,979
find these and identify if you do have

28
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:05,548
these in your container or near your

29
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,950
plants the coal here to prevent them is

30
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,939
to keep the surface as dry as you can

31
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,650
help reduce the pressure on the plant

32
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:15,959
now this can be after you plant you

33
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,969
could top dress with like perlite sand

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,188
or rice hulls these are all ways to kind

35
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,618
of keep that surface very dry which can

36
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:24,750
really reduce and prevent the fungus

37
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,659
gnats from getting established you can

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,519
increase with numbers when plants are

39
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,909
stressed by nutrients or excessive

40
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,890
irrigation so by over watering or kind

41
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,659
of over stressing the plants can meet

42
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,790
other ways you can encourage fungus

43
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,030
gnats trigger that excessive irrigation

44
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,060
keeping that soil surface wet will only

45
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:47,009
hurt your plants by both suffocating the

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,859
roots but also potentially increasing

47
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,329
these on this gnats population bogus

48
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,069
gnats can also live on green algae that

49
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:54,449
may be growing in media or containers so

50
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,029
important to keep that clean for a

51
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,500
variety of reasons avoid excessive water

52
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,030
in the media in the environment as this

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,549
only encourages a fungus gnat

54
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,890
development how to control them well

55
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,159
there's predatory mites it can be an

56
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,538
option some feed on both the eggs in the

57
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,609
larvae which is a great one to select

58
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,829
adults do not feed on the plant and

59
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,740
females can live to 200 eggs and the

60
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,320
seven to ten days BTR Bacillus

61
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,960
thuringiensis can be applied to the

62
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,349
media surface and it's effective against

63
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,760
the larva as we can see here this is a

64
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,049
leaf sample here these are peanut leaves

65
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,929
which is shows you the example of the

66
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,189
effectiveness of bt this is a normal

67
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,430
peanut leaf this is when it's been

68
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:37,469
treated bt and you can see the much

69
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,020
reduced feeding activity and the ones

70
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:41,490
truth bt who knows that if not you can

71
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,960
see the mouth parts here for the fungus

72
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,150
gnats indicating there can be pretty

73
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,310
aggressive feeders and really be very

74
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,310
destructive to your plants
