1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,109
now cloning is a common practice with

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,580
cannabis plants so we're gonna go over

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,040
if you were to dedicate an entire room

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,780
to that what would it look like you know

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,149
you can see many growers will and they

6
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,919
can be small operations they can be very

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,019
large operations depending on the

8
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,550
cloning just to point out initially here

9
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,050
on both of these instances you see the

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,760
labeling which is important to keep

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,469
track of those clones so you know

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,920
exactly what you have and where it came

13
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:25,469
from

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,699
now the general comparison of clone

15
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:28,469
rooms to regular rooms it will they

16
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,330
should be the smallest of the rooms and

17
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,858
this is including or comparing to

18
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,210
vegetative and flowering rooms

19
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,710
simply because the plants will be the

20
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,870
smallest and you want to control

21
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,219
humidity a temperature so keeping

22
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,229
everything small makes it a little bit

23
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,689
easier to go about doing that

24
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:45,238
then comparison to like a large flower

25
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,009
room clone rooms for as far as lighting

26
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:48,689
goes fluorescent lights are advised that

27
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,009
this is reduced power consumption and

28
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:52,140
minimal heat generated

29
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,609
however ceramic metal halides are

30
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,859
gaining popularity for the reduced

31
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,869
number of bulbs and ease in comparison

32
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,179
to fluorescents typically t5

33
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:02,218
fluorescents have been used however I

34
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:06,420
think going forward Cermak male halides

35
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,280
are going to be replacing t5 fixtures t5

36
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,430
fixtures with fluorescents require long

37
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,579
bulbs many bulbs this is one light here

38
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,590
when light bulb can do a large area very

39
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,599
similar to what two fives can do also

40
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,100
bulb life is much longer into mobile

41
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,629
ballast here so there's a lot of

42
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:24,419
advantages going to ceramic metal

43
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:27,089
halides over fluorescence in t5

44
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,400
fluorescence in particular again that

45
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,560
lighting that us this is at six hundred

46
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,320
and fifteen watts for male halide or a

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,150
thousand watt metal halide can be used

48
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,938
to efficiently cover a large area land

49
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,049
propagating large number of clones

50
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:42,539
keeping this light intensity low on

51
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,479
plants so the foliage is not burned can

52
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,189
be accomplished by paying this light of

53
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,679
good distance away usually at least

54
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:51,269
about five feet if you get two moveable

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,799
ballasts that's also a great option

56
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:54,060
because that was it hang it the same

57
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,700
height and just kind of go through and

58
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,930
adjust it there or hang shape anything

59
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,390
between the light and the plants that

60
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,000
can help again reduce the chance of

61
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,739
burning the tender plants if you're

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,259
trying to maintain or use the same

63
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:11,159
lights for multiple purposes so here we

64
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,348
see scaling up so clone room or a clone

65
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,829
tent in this case and staking up a two

66
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:16,409
by two

67
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,230
area.this the clones that are propagated

68
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,659
in this 2x2 area can support an 8x8

69
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:22,919
flowering law so when a plan accordingly

70
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,870
because remember in this small

71
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,329
propagation plants roomy very close

72
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,719
together I did this for a little size

73
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:34,740
comparison this is a 2x2 grow tent this

74
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,930
is only a 4 foot by 2 foot 10 so an 8 by

75
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,020
8 is a much larger area so if you pack

76
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,700
this small 2x2 structure and you want to

77
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,439
make all those clones to make it you

78
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:45,810
want to be sure that you also have for

79
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,939
at least flowering stage and 8 by 8 grow

80
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,590
tend to help support though all the

81
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:53,099
clones that are produced in that small

82
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,569
2x2 area prepare the material we want to

83
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,370
make sure that mother plant will be

84
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,590
providing the clones is a healthy plant

85
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,530
because that's critical to the success

86
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,509
of the vegetative process or the

87
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,890
propagation process here the cloning in

88
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:07,500
particular I want to make sure that

89
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:10,739
mother or stock plant is as healthy as

90
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,449
possible so in that clone room we want

91
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,520
to keep the conditions around 70 to 80

92
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:15,869
degrees Fahrenheit simply hanging a

93
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,030
thermometer would be great to help

94
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,030
monitor that make sure you're staying

95
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,919
within that range humidity 70 to 100

96
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,289
percent again depending how early in the

97
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,030
propagation cloning process 100 percent

98
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,699
very early and then reducing that over

99
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,340
time to 70 percent those higher amounts

100
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,560
early will help reduce the chance that

101
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,560
the Leafs are going to burn as things

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,479
are going to desiccate out yeah I want

103
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,739
to prepare for the outside if our clones

104
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,889
are going to go into an outside

105
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,599
environment for that transition plan

106
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:47,309
should be putted into larger containers

107
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,159
and deeper containers to allow for a

108
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,110
larger root development and profile to

109
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,209
be established before going the very

110
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,470
stressful outside environment the also

111
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,360
should be what's called hardened off

112
00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:00,449
before being placed in the field by

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,190
exposing them to bright light again when

114
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,629
it work them up to brighter light before

115
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:07,109
we just throw them outside into the

116
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:08,489
harsh full Sun of the outside the use of

117
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,320
ceramic metal halides can reduce

118
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,330
hardening off time has printed

119
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
transition to the harsh again natural

120
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,390
sunlight so I want to be mindful what

121
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,939
lights you are using if you go from

122
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,469
fluorescents those are very subdued

123
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,089
lights and great for propagation

124
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,680
well if you're looking at ultimate going

125
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,379
outside you might want to use a higher

126
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,490
discharge light it's for reduce the

127
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,829
chance those plants are going to burn

128
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,439
when they hit the outside

129
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:34,649
the summary here these clone rooms can

130
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,750
be simple effective even use grow tents

131
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,969
in some instances Rockville can be used

132
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,819
as routing media humidity domes across

133
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,410
the nights are often easy and effective

134
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:45,300
we can also add a heat mat here to help

135
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,920
encourage routing here so we have the

136
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,189
humidity dome to maintain the amenity

137
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,410
and he'd met here to keep those rooting

138
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,879
areas a little bit warmer he is the

139
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,130
transfer clones to more light and less

140
00:04:53,879 --> 00:05:00,500
MIDI to ease their transition to the

141
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,500
soon-to-be vegetative environment
