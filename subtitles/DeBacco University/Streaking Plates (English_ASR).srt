1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
okay I'm Gor proper technique to streak

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,500
plate so yeah beautiful place that look

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,130
like this we're trying to isolate and/or

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,599
grow bacteria for example so a goal

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,460
plate streaking if done properly you'll

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,759
be able to take a small sample and

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,679
either multiply it or separated isolated

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,390
samples so here we're just looking at

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,278
multiplying it and you're looking at

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,080
trying to isolate individual colonies

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,219
and you look a little closer here you

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,419
can see these counties are definitely

13
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,009
different than these you might be at a

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,199
pic one of these and then go through and

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,170
multiply that on a separate plate so

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,190
that's the goals of plate streaking

17
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,109
required tools or a petri dish

18
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,079
agar the culture you're dealing with

19
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,820
inoculating loop and also a flame then

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,009
we're going to through in flaming the

21
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,770
not flitting loop here we're using a

22
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,929
Bunsen burner so it's important to keep

23
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,180
in mind that the top of that middle cone

24
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,469
is the hottest portion you want to be

25
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,238
way up here when you're sterilizing you

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,058
know want to be way down here that very

27
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,218
top portion of that center cone is the

28
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,929
best and hottest part when you're

29
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,480
looking at sterilizing your inoculating

30
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,890
loop transfer the culture when i

31
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,670
sterilize the loop as I showed in a

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,900
previous slide let it cool so you don't

33
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,219
want to just go directly from the hot

34
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,500
flames of the culture because you'll

35
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,118
burn and kill them all then after it

36
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,129
cools I'm gonna pick up the culture from

37
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,349
the stock plate spread the culture using

38
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,209
a zig zag pattern and only one portion

39
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,069
of the petri dishes you see here kind of

40
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,959
this back and forth motion well that's

41
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,239
gonna do is it's gonna allow through

42
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,750
friction cultures to be transferred to

43
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,699
the media on that petri dish then we can

44
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,560
get spreading that culture you know what

45
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,909
sterilized a loop a lot to cool in a

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,250
cooling that can't stress that enough

47
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,170
streak through the original area and

48
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,810
spread cultures using that same zig-zag

49
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,670
pattern on only one portion of the petri

50
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,439
dish repeat this process dragging

51
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,629
through for most recent streak as you

52
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,519
left off on what does that mean well

53
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:52,319
here was our initial Street well you can

54
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,179
see our next when we drag through that

55
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,379
initial one and there's exact pattern

56
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,409
again stopped reenact it we sorry we

57
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:03,569
sterilized the loop cleaned it put it

58
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,859
back down here went through that initial

59
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,019
streak and again back and forth back and

60
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,729
forth and this is kind of a way to help

61
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,239
ensure we're spraying that bacteria and

62
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,650
spreading it out well this is gonna be

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,539
gone into what's called

64
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,579
T Street which is kind of a formal term

65
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:19,109
for this it's a very common pattern used

66
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:21,120
in microbiology labs because it looks

67
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,920
like a tea you'll start here you'll

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,599
zigzag back and forth you'll end here

69
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,068
and then you'll go through and you'll

70
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:27,810
drag through that you'll kind of go

71
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:30,358
through another area we sterilize the

72
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,949
loop and do a third time so you could

73
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,140
see here's our initial we drag through

74
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:35,908
that another spreading and then a third

75
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,889
and if it comes out properly it'll look

76
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:41,340
like this and this is great milking it

77
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:43,108
isolating bacteria individual colonies

78
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,120
and this and then allows you to pick

79
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:46,829
those colonies and then transfer it and

80
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,039
multiply it on another plate at a later

81
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:49,040
date
