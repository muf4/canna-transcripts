00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,759
welcome to another video here on debaco

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,879
university

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,960
today we're going to be looking at

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,519
characteristics of common fibers looking

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,679
at both

6
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,279
natural and synthetic fibers in this

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,120
presentation

8
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,558
now natural fibers while there are many

9
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:15,919
the ones we're going to be focusing on

10
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:16,640
here in this presentation are going to

11
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,839
be wool

12
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,760
cotton hemp jute and silk we can see

13
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,278
that there are many other fibers however

14
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,920
these are typically

15
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,399
made into clothing and likely to be

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,599
found

17
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,839
and analyzed for comparison purposes

18
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,759
now the wool fibers themselves are

19
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,679
typically in natural hair grown on sheep

20
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,719
and composed of protein substances such

21
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,558
as keratin

22
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,000
wool fibers have crimps and curls which

23
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,039
create pockets and give the wool a

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,719
spongy feel

25
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,799
and create insulation it creates kind of

26
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,280
that air spaces that allow

27
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,038
to have great insulating properties the

28
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,840
outer surface of the fiber consists of a

29
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
series of

30
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,840
serrated scales which overlap each other

31
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,759
we can see that image here

32
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,680
this is a microscopic view but they kind

33
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,679
of look like scales of a fish

34
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,119
and this makes the possible for these

35
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,600
fibers to cling together

36
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,518
and produce felt and this insulating

37
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,920
factor is great here for the sheep

38
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,560
and llamas and alpacas but they have

39
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
that very

40
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,719
similar insulating property with their

41
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,478
fibers

42
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,239
going on to plant material looking here

43
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,920
at cotton it's the most important

44
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,560
textile fiber in the world

45
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,240
cotton is a natural vegetable fiber and

46
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,240
produced on the cotton plant

47
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,359
and it kind of looks like cotton balls

48
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,519
on the plant

49
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,438
however this is in its natural form this

50
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,759
would be harvested here

51
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,118
cut and magnified about 100 times you

52
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,560
can see some of the fibers are rather

53
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,159
flat and looks like a ribbon when it

54
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,159
twists let me see that evident right

55
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,000
here hemp or flax fibers

56
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
they are cellulose fibers with

57
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,280
properties that are similar

58
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,118
and are scarily differentiated

59
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,960
at the fiber form so this

60
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,799
differentiation between these two

61
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,239
as far as identifying specifically which

62
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,640
one that we have

63
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,078
is complicated by the treatment process

64
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,959
so sometimes it can be difficult to

65
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,718
identify

66
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,640
whether you're looking at a flax or a

67
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,959
hemp fiber

68
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,239
now jute fibers themselves are one of

69
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,399
the most important

70
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,799
and affordable natural fibers and it's

71
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,120
harder than other textile fibers

72
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
typically they're made into for example

73
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
burlap bags

74
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,919
in jute twine because they're

75
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
environmentally friendly and normally

76
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,919
used for these kind of materials

77
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,959
or tufts of carpet where there's a lot

78
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,119
of structure

79
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,959
that's needed also the fact that they're

80
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,878
biodegradable is great that there can be

81
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,878
used outside a lot of times to buying up

82
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,598
tomato plants we use a jute twine

83
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,959
keep in mind while it is biodegradable

84
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,878
it doesn't break down necessary very

85
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,840
quickly and can be left in the field for

86
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,239
a little while

87
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
before it naturally over time will break

88
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
down

89
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,159
there's also silk fibers so silk fibers

90
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,958
also made of proteins these are secreted

91
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,719
by a caterpillar specifically a silkworm

92
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,479
and they feed on selective plants and

93
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,318
they actually spin cocoons

94
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,318
they form this silk as a protective

95
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,479
shell to perpetuate their own

96
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,878
life man interferes with the life cycle

97
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,639
of the cocoon stage to obtain the silk

98
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,079
which is a continuous filament for

99
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,839
commercial importance

100
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
and it can thought of to produce very

101
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,360
high end fibers in this case

102
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,919
looking now at synthetic fibers so rayon

103
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,519
acrylic polyester nylon and spun glass

104
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,199
are the ones we're going to be looking

105
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,239
at here that fall under the

106
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,199
synthetic fiber category now rand's the

107
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,599
first one

108
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,158
here it's brand will absorb moisture

109
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,238
more so than cotton it's also breathable

110
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,000
comfortable to wear and easily dyed into

111
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,519
vivid colors this is what makes it a

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,680
popular choice

113
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,759
for clothing for example it also doesn't

114
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,080
build up static electricity

115
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,479
nor will it will it develop that pilling

116
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,799
unless the fiber is made from short

117
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,959
low twist yarns rayon shares the

118
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,959
properties similar to those of cotton

119
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,519
rand fiber itself is comfortable soft to

120
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,199
the skin and has moderate dry strength

121
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,799
and abrasion resistance

122
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,639
so again all properties that make it

123
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,040
very favorable to made into different

124
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,158
textiles particularly clothing

125
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,878
acrylic can be thought of as artificial

126
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,798
wool imitation it has wool's warmth and

127
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,280
softness but does not absorb water

128
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,480
but wicks moisture to the surface where

129
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
it evaporates

130
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,919
so that's important know if you're

131
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,039
looking at you know type of clothing or

132
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,280
something that may have involved

133
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,238
water this shows an example of acrylic

134
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,600
fiber

135
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,518
showing the melt termination in the

136
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,359
lower right right right here

137
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,360
and the mechanical damage determination

138
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,399
in the upper left up here so again we're

139
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,680
looking at the microscope

140
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:30,319
there are ways to help identify this

141
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,959
polyester so polyester is the most

142
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,199
commonly used

143
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,039
synthetic fiber often blend with other

144
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,400
fibers like cotton to get the best kind

145
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,960
of of both worlds

146
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,560
because while polyester fibers have good

147
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,560
elasticity and wrinkle resistance

148
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,759
shape retention excellent wash and wear

149
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
performance and durability

150
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,800
if it's widely used however polyester

151
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,520
fibers are as poor in moisture

152
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,120
absorption its clothing makes the wear

153
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,159
feel hot and sticky which people don't

154
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,918
want to feel

155
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,199
but does have a lot of other advantage

156
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,039
properties

157
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,600
so as a result this is why it can be

158
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,400
mixed with other fibers

159
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,039
so that polyester alone kind of produces

160
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,638
that static

161
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,560
electricity easily when result of

162
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,079
clothing absorbing dust clinging to the

163
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,720
body and has poor comfort

164
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,599
this way to be have a blend of this but

165
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
it alone

166
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
sample plaster fiber sample here

167
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,399
polyester thread

168
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,240
inference color is high order white

169
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,918
which can be seen here with multiple

170
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,840
interference orders evident where the

171
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,599
fiber cross at right angle so we can see

172
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,000
that evident here and here

173
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,680
and here we're looking at this bar would

174
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,240
represent 50 microns for looking at size

175
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,120
nylon does not absorb water but also

176
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,439
means that the

177
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,478
movement combined to create static

178
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,639
electricity

179
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,680
so this is again something else where

180
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
may not be a

181
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,478
pure uh garment made only of nylon and

182
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,560
some of the look and feel of silk as you

183
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,560
can kind of see the shininess to

184
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,879
the twine kind of here it's made of

185
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,439
nylon it's used in sheer

186
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,159
it's used in sales parachutes gallons

187
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,038
veils

188
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
swimsuits car tires so it has a lot of

189
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,038
uses

190
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,359
different types of nylon that also can

191
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:05,759
be

192
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
replaced wool as the fiber used in

193
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,800
carpets

194
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,038
here's a sample of nylon fiber from a

195
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,720
furnace air filter we can kind of see

196
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,079
how we're getting those what it looks

197
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,479
like when it crosses over

198
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,318
and also the distance here we can also

199
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,758
get it looking at it woven here

200
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,800
on the microscopic scale lastly we have

201
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,280
spun glass

202
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,079
this is one of the strongest textile

203
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,239
fibers

204
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,000
having the greater specific tensile

205
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,000
strength than steel wire

206
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,759
and the same diameter at a lower weight

207
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,800
so just that alone

208
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,199
speaks to its rigidity and its strength

209
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,079
now the glass uh fabrics have excellent

210
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,680
heat resistance

211
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,599
with a softening point of about 1 55

212
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
degrees fahrenheit or 846 degrees

213
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,319
celsius

214
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
and a melting point it's very high of

215
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,840
over 2000 degrees fahrenheit and over

216
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,439
1100 degrees celsius glass fabrics are

217
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,079
non-combustible highly resistant to

218
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,160
attack

219
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,399
by most chemicals and unaffected by

220
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,400
sunlight fungus or bacteria

221
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,758
so this is great if they're going to be

222
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,918
used in

223
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,199
areas that maybe have a lot of sunlight

224
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,918
exposure

225
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,680
need resistance to chemicals so they do

226
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,918
have some great properties

227
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,598
and it's very strong however it may not

228
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,120
always be the case that we may need it

229
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,199
has a different kind of texture or

230
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,560
feel and this is why some of your other

231
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,199
fibers are more commonly found in

232
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,680
clothing

233
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,478
but for specialized tasks spun glass

234
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,759
definitely

235
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,758
has a purpose
