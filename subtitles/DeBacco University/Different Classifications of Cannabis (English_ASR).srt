1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,879
thank you for tuning in to another

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,799
debaco university video

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,240
in this video we'll be looking at

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,120
different classifications

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,519
of cannabis and how we kind of define

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,678
some of those classifications as well

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,118
so first off it's all cannabis say in

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,600
the hemp sense that hemp

9
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,278
fiber marijuana all fall under the broad

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,439
category of cannabis

11
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,679
within the cannabis category though each

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,160
offer further classification

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,518
and has specific definition allowing for

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,320
distinction from the different

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,799
subsets within the broader term that we

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,159
call

17
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,919
cannabis so we have hemp being defied by

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,558
the fda and farm bill

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,600
particularly the 2018 farm bill that was

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,919
signed into law in december 20 2018

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,760
among other things this new law changes

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,679
certain federal authorities relating to

23
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,479
the production and marketing of hemp

24
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,679
they define hemp as the plant cannabis

25
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,238
sativa el

26
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,439
and any part of that plant including the

27
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,198
seeds thereof

28
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,718
and all derivatives extracts

29
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:04,399
cannabinoids isomers

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,879
acids salts and salts of isomers

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,880
whether growing or not with a delta nine

32
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:13,759
tetracannabidiol concentration of not

33
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:17,039
more than 0.3 percent of a dry weight

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,280
basis and that is thc if you were one of

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,759
delta 9 thc that you may be familiar

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,000
with

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,879
this is how they define hemp hemp is

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
basically

39
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,679
not more than 0.3 dry weight thc is how

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,719
the fda

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,920
and farm bill of 2018 define

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,519
hemp now we have also fiber hemp so

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,040
within hemp there's kind of all these

44
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,679
different kind of

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,520
subsets but fiberhemp is a sustainable

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,320
and high yielding industrial crop

47
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,959
that can help meet high global global

48
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,199
demands

49
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,118
for fiber so it's been used in this

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
sense as the actual kind of

51
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,118
twine here or fiber production for

52
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,519
clothing for example as well

53
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,159
hemp can be grown for fiber seeds and or

54
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,920
for

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,159
dual purpose in a wide range of

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,118
geographic zones and climates making it

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,759
favorable

58
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,599
to grow in different areas so it's not

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,319
just like it's got to be isolated to one

60
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,719
area

61
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,519
it is favorable over a large rain of

62
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,359
geographic zones and also the products

63
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
that it can produce can also be used for

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,400
a wide variety of

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,200
different tasks or different kind of

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,800
textiles foods cosmetics medicines

67
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,359
antimicrobials there's a whole bunch of

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,920
things

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,080
kind of looking at a potential for the

70
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,639
use of a fiber hemp

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
and then marijuana lastly here how we

72
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,199
how do we define marijuana then

73
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,360
uh this can be called weed pot dope or

74
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,799
cannabis just in the kind of quick term

75
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
and this is usually referring to the

76
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,280
dried flowers and leaves of the cannabis

77
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,598
plant

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,919
and this contains some mind altering

79
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,639
psychoactive compounds like

80
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,399
thc for example and this is as well as

81
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,878
other active compounds it can also

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,200
contain cannabidiol which is cbd

83
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,120
and they are non-mind altering but what

84
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,399
again defines it as truly

85
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,039
marijuana goes back to the 2018

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,319
farm bill and marijuana would be defined

87
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:09,759
as simply having greater than

88
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,199
0.3 percent tht and a dry weight basis

89
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,959
so immediately as soon as that plant

90
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,079
sees that flower goes above that

91
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,239
threshold there

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,040
it crosses the divide between what we

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,158
define here is hemp to what we commonly

94
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,400
refer to here as

95
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,359
marijuana so again important to make

96
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,360
that distinct

97
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,480
distinction and hopefully you were able

98
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,319
to learn something

99
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,318
within this video here
