1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,110
okay in this lecture series I'm going to

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,298
show you some identifications for

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,120
verticillium well so you can determine

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,059
if you're seeing this in your grow

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,829
operation so the identification will

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:15,359
sasso low-born fungus ii survive for

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,460
four to fifteen years depending on

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,350
conditions well makes this a little

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,689
concerning is that either even under

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,820
unfavorable conditions verticillium can

11
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,160
last for four years and under more

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,420
favorable fifteen how it will look on

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,699
the leaves to kind of get this kind of

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,050
house belief kind of turns yellow

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,640
ultimately curling and getting a little

16
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,739
bit of burn associated with it

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,539
another microscopes got this instinctive

18
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,968
cluster like look with these circles

19
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,460
almost like grapes at the kind of

20
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,320
appearance though that occurs now we're

21
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,910
to look for Britta silly Molly well

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,549
first off you want to inspect the roots

23
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:50,009
because this is soil borne however in

24
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,558
addition to that if you have a plant

25
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:55,649
that suspected of having this you can

26
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,259
cut the stem on the plant that's thought

27
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,689
to be infected is recommended the reason

28
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,820
why this is because this is a vascular

29
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,829
disease so let us enter the root goes

30
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,599
through the vascular system and though

31
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,090
it can be discoloration found as we see

32
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,919
here resumed can infect the xylem of the

33
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,040
plant as little as 24 hours ago a very

34
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,200
quick and aggressive fungus wilting may

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,140
only occur on part of the plant and it

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,969
can be vascular system specific what

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,180
this means is it may only enter a

38
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,590
portion of the xylem indicating half the

39
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,729
plant will kind of wilt the other half

40
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,609
will look just fine

41
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:32,368
this shows kind of this specificity of

42
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,719
this disease that can occur rather does

43
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:35,790
the whole plant going down if it only

44
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,459
gets into one particular bundle of xylem

45
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,350
only a portion of the plant they wilt

46
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,819
and if you cut the plant may see these

47
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:43,919
distinctive rings and that's again

48
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,889
indication potentially of having

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,840
verticillium well how to prevent it well

50
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,879
the fungus can survive and so for long

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,978
periods with or without plant material

52
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,009
present so that's really not good news

53
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:59,188
for growers know your chosen media

54
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,590
source make sure it's reliable and newly

55
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:03,359
open containers is strongly encourage

56
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,040
mean don't be reusing or having very old

57
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,219
containers hanging around Bavarian law

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,469
prevention is also the only reliable

59
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,550
method of control for this fungus this

60
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,009
kind of gives you an idea what it'll

61
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,080
take under the microscope

62
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,659
how to control it well there is limited

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,920
control once affection occurs sorry

64
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,259
there's no real good news there

65
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,179
something the sites may help but it

66
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,459
should not be really relied upon for a

67
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,409
cure for this problem again it shows you

68
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,180
a little bit kind of the leaf the leaf

69
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,250
structure we'll have a look and we'll

70
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,590
yellow and if you do put into that

71
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,449
standard typically we'll see that Brown

72
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,189
region because it is transported through

73
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:40,079
the xylem which is in the vascular

74
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,239
system of the plant so well there's no

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,469
great control prevention is the name of

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,469
the game with verticillium wilt
