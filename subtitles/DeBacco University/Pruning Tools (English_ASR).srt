1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,379
well there may be many pruning tools to

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:06,209
choose from and generally fall into

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,388
three main categories which I'm going to

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:11,609
discuss briefly here of those three

5
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,230
the first one is plant removal and this

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,119
is done at the point of harvest and

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,118
requires heavy duties loppers we see

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,129
here it seemed to be very robust and

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,640
good for cutting the entire plant down

10
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:26,939
at the main stem then we have four large

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,469
cuts which should be avoided ideally but

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,589
often necessary at some points we have

13
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:33,420
these large heavy-duty hand pruners the

14
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,909
last one is detailed pruning let me see

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,620
evident here this requires more labour

16
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,628
but can result in a more efficient plant

17
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,179
over the season and these have a very

18
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:46,019
small cutting area and these are kind of

19
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:48,149
for the cutting those nice weak stamens

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,129
those nice kind of weak leaves out makes

21
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,140
a very quick very efficient operation

22
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:53,698
can fit your whole hand in there so

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,670
those are the three main types of

24
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:59,718
pruning tools there to use was a typical

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,719
cannabis operation
