00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,839
welcome to this tobacco university video

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,919
here we're going to be looking at carbon

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,798
accident enrichment levels and cannabis

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,719
production

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,638
while this beginning picture may show

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,798
rice is also a 3

7
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,239
c3 plant much like cannabis so we're

8
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,800
going to develop some conclusions

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,519
and we're looking at enrichment levels

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,490
is more

11
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:26,559
always better

12
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:28,399
[Music]

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,399
all right so looking at just a picture

14
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,359
here of the rice we can see

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,839
400 or about 390 to 400 is considered to

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,600
be atmospheric or normal carbon dioxide

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,600
levels and we can see how there is a

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
difference in rice production

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,120
definitely as we go below that we see it

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,520
kind of dwindling off

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,599
and above that we are seeing an increase

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,399
in yields or at least in biomass

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,399
so how does this apply to cannabis so

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,840
first off if we're looking at what level

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,120
we want to keep our plants at there's

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,399
some considerations

27
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,000
well the first consideration is

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
basically atmospheric levels which is

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,799
about 400 parts per million

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,558
this is offers the advantage of no

31
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,000
additional equipment would be needed if

32
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,920
you were looking at enriching your

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,239
plants with 400 parts per million

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,200
simply want to just keep air circulating

35
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,839
the disadvantages

36
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,799
is this can limit yields to the whatever

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
the atmosphere

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,720
is able to provide and if you're in a

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,799
closed growing area you definitely want

40
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,959
to make sure you're moving air around

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,240
because there is a chance that foreign

42
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,599
parts per million that is normal

43
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,280
atmospheric levels

44
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,719
in your growing facility it could be

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,799
lower

46
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,078
so what if we enrich to the 400 to 800

47
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,320
part per million range

48
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,359
well the advantage is increasing yields

49
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,758
however this does

50
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,680
start to require specialized equipment

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,959
even in the 400 to 800

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,000
part per million range so what about 800

53
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,438
to 1200 parts

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
what's if a little is good why don't

55
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,359
just go a little bit more the advantage

56
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,280
this can also or still increase yields

57
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,879
it can use lights that produce a greater

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,040
intensity as well

59
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,000
to take advantage of this increased

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,600
carbon level

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,438
the disadvantages is the cost of the

62
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,399
equipment and actual the carbon dioxide

63
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,798
however you're going to be

64
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,320
using or producing it in the sense that

65
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,118
as you get higher levels it's going to

66
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,438
require more

67
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,199
and more carbon dioxide to be added to

68
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,199
your growing area

69
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,439
and then we have the upper end of the

70
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,598
range 1200 to 1600 parts per million

71
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,199
well advantages is that ensures carbon

72
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,479
exit will not be limiting

73
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,399
however the disadvantage it will have

74
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,199
the highest cost simply because you are

75
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,280
adding

76
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,238
a high dosing level from a plant

77
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,039
standpoint

78
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,560
of carbon dioxide so we have to weigh

79
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,959
all these different factors

80
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
what range of carbon monoxide levels are

81
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,959
you going to keep

82
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,959
your plants at
