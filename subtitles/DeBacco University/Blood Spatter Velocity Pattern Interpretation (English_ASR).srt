1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
okay here we're going to be looking at

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,559
blood spider velocity pattern

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,240
interpretation meaning how quick was the

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,519
blood traveling and how is that going to

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,400
look when it impacts

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,480
a surface so first off there's blood

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,600
spider velocity classifications

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,240
i mean just says no f slash s is feet

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,640
per second

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,759
m s is meters per second as far as a

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,000
rate goes

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,920
low velocity is classified mainly as

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,679
your gravity forces only

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,679
meeting velocity is like the force of a

15
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,880
hammer swing and high velocity be

16
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:35,439
gunshot producing a fine mist of blood

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
so first off our low velocity the spot

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,718
diameter is mostly between

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,878
four to eight millimeter range common

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,800
low velocity situations are free falling

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:46,000
drops due to gravity only

22
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,718
a cast off dripping splashing or

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,320
arterial spurting would all kind of fall

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,439
under the classification of a low

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,960
velocity blood

26
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,959
spatter this uh splash pattern

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
again a volume less than one milliliter

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
subject to low velocity

29
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,839
impact could be thrown or tipped visual

30
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,759
characteristics include

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,000
large central irregular areas surrounded

32
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,158
by elongated peripheral spatter

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,359
patterns kind of see here is an example

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
of a water drop and again

35
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,079
while water is slightly different

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
properties in blood this gives you just

37
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,560
an idea

38
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,680
of what might be occurring to develop a

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640
spatter pattern for blood this is kind

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,159
of what it would look like in a

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,040
cartoon-like image

42
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,479
in the sense of for a low impact

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,520
velocity

44
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,959
here's a blood simulated squirted from a

45
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,158
syringe at a height of one meter and

46
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,879
this kind of gives you again that low

47
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,680
velocity

48
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,319
kind of cast off like look to it and how

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
things

50
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,959
may kind of be interpreted in that sense

51
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,359
there's a little zoom in

52
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,719
version of that again this is all low

53
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,920
velocities you can see a lot of the

54
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,759
blood staying together

55
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,759
drops being very large in this case it

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,359
almost looks slightly raised as well

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,519
from accumulation of blood

58
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,680
this was a fair amount this was five

59
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,959
milliliters squirted

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,960
this kind of gives you an idea of that

61
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,438
kind of that cast off that kind of

62
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,478
direction there that kind of spattering

63
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,718
that has occurred

64
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,478
so this again can be used for

65
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,719
calculation of convergence

66
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,560
as well as many other things as far as

67
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,759
determining where that blood originated

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,000
from

69
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,519
now the arterial spurt pattern this is

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,719
blood exiting the body under artillery

71
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,360
or pressure because your

72
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,000
heart is producing that pressure so your

73
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,319
arteries

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,280
in particular there's having a lot of

75
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,119
pressure of blood

76
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,719
well if there's a laceration that occurs

77
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
there can be an arterial spur that

78
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,959
occurs

79
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,800
these are large stains with a downward

80
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
flow and vertical surfaces

81
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
waveform from position flow may be

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,280
apparent

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
so what does that look like in this

84
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
extreme case here this would be an

85
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,159
example of arterial spurt

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,120
this area here would be a spatter

87
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,560
pattern in general

88
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
this shows that arterial sport would

89
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,039
kind of could have been a laceration in

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,639
extreme case say to the neck region

91
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,479
then we get to medium velocity blood

92
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,919
splatter so the blood source subjected

93
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,359
to medium velocity impact

94
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,199
again we're talking a little bit faster

95
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
here spot diameter is going to be

96
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,238
smaller than our low velocity it's going

97
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
to be mostly in the one to four

98
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
millimeter range because it's traveling

99
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,158
at a quicker rate

100
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,239
of speed so this is the point of impact

101
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,479
at 15 centimeters in front of a vertical

102
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,719
target surface and here's a six inch

103
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,919
ruler for comparison and looking here

104
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,359
at a medium velocity blood spatter okay

105
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,559
here we're looking at high velocity

106
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
blood spatter

107
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,840
this is going to be producing a fine

108
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,800
mist with spot size

109
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
less than 0.1 millimeters small mass

110
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,120
limits

111
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,399
spread to about one meter and some

112
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,480
larger outputs can reach

113
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,158
further um this is typically evident

114
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,199
from like a gunshot where there's black

115
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,359
spatter from an

116
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,318
entry wound or the forward spider from

117
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,599
an exit wound

118
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:40,399
or as a result from high speed machinery

119
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,000
you can see here the difference visually

120
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,760
that that high velocity blood spider

121
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
definitely has

122
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,679
now gunshot back and forth spider so

123
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,158
here we have the gun being fired

124
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,439
that blood stained foam held just above

125
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,679
the target surface

126
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,878
so the bullet passes from left to right

127
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,200
just above the sheet

128
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,719
bullets traveling in this direction bull

129
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,479
enters the foam

130
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,479
it's going to exit the foam here and you

131
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,560
have your back splatter entry and you

132
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,840
have your forward splatter to exit

133
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,840
and this is ultimate where the bolts

134
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,039
going to end up up so it gives you this

135
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,759
idea of

136
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,120
how there's differences when it comes in

137
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,878
initially contact with an object and how

138
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
it's exiting an object

139
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,639
again this can be very important looking

140
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,680
at a wall or determining which direction

141
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,680
a gun was fired

142
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,600
or determined where it may have impacted

143
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,079
a particular surface

144
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,879
go to the back spatter here originates

145
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,560
from the

146
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,159
entrance wound passes back towards the

147
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
weapon and the shooter

148
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
seen only at close range of fire areas

149
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,439
to analyze would be inside the barrel

150
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,439
x-ray of the weapon

151
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,719
okay in the arm the chest of the shooter

152
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,120
this kind of shows you the black spider

153
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,600
on a

154
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,478
steadying hand and how fine the mist can

155
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
be

156
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,199
on that particular hand there because

157
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,680
this is again high velocity

158
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,439
the gunshot forward spatter here

159
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,639
originates from the exit wound so here

160
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,759
we have the impact

161
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,840
of the object in this case we'll say

162
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,040
it's the head of the individual and then

163
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,799
here we have the

164
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,199
kind of forward splatter here from the

165
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
exit wound passes forwards in the same

166
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,199
direction the shotgun the boat's

167
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,319
traveling in this

168
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,120
direction it produces more blood

169
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,279
than the previous back spatter it can be

170
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,038
seen at any range of fire

171
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,119
investigate nearby surfaces such the

172
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,839
object the person especially the wall or

173
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
area behind the victim if that warrants

174
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,959
it in the particular case that you're

175
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,160
investigating

176
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,918
this high velocity blood spatter

177
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,199
forward splatter and target is placed 15

178
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,279
centimeters behind the point

179
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,478
high velocity impact force better the

180
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,599
closest view here

181
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,319
and this kind of gives you that

182
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,800
appreciation for those that fine mist

183
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,079
that occurs and the varying amounts

184
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,600
basically on the entry

185
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,599
or the exit wound there
