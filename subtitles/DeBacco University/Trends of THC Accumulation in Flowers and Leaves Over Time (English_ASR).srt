00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,279
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,000
going to be going

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,919
over trends in thc accumulation in

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,400
flowers and leaves over time

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,399
looking at some data to see how this

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,599
cannabinoid accumulates in different

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
parts of the plants

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
over a period of time

9

[Music]

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,640
all right let's get into the trends of

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,160
tghc accumulation in flowers and leaves

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,839
so first off this is the research

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,920
article that i'm basing the information

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,640
on so welcome to take a look at it again

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,399
just providing a brief summary here so

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,280
the time course for accumulation of

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,759
delta nine

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,480
thc and flowers in medical marijuana

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,320
plants

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,759
so floral and leaf samples were

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,039
collected from two strains that they

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,878
looked at here

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,160
at multiple intervals during the flower

24
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:51,839
induction stage

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,279
this plant material was collected from

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,199
greenhouse grown plants

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,120
the accumulation of the delta nine thc

28
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,079
in these samples was determined and we

29
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,320
presented here

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,759
in graphical form so what do those

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,039
graphs kind of look like well here's

32
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,438
what we're looking at

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,799
uh we have the same sour willie a

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,239
variety here

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,240
we're looking at that accumulation of

36
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,679
our delta iron here we have the leaf and

37
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,158
we have the flower so again on

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,560
our y-axis we have the delta nine thc

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,400
percent dry weight in both examples

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,960
and then we have days post-flower

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,600
induction here on the x-axis

42
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,039
uh letter a this kind of graph here what

43
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,359
this is showing this report

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
is the average of three plants for delta

45
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,519
nine thc levels and floral

46
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,399
samples is the solid line and leaf

47
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,599
samples here

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,560
is the dotted line panel b over here

49
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,158
is showing the delta nine thc in floral

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,159
samples from the top of the plant

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,079
which is the solid line and the bottom

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
of the plant which is the dotted line

53
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,199
what we're noticing overall is that the

54
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,799
leaf stays

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,799
pretty stable and doesn't really

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,520
accumulate a whole lot overall

57
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,118
the flower does increase over time but

58
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,640
we can see that there's also some great

59
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:59,519
variability

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,040
looking here at the higher portions of

61
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,759
the plant leaves versus the lower

62
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,359
portions

63
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,959
seems like the higher portions tend to

64
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,319
accumulate a little bit more

65
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,318
especially towards the end here we're

66
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,598
noticing a little bit of a pickup there

67
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,238
now the other variety that they looked

68
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,639
at um let me make myself a little

69
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,920
smaller same basic uh idea here

70
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:20,238
same basic kind of data collection uh

71
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,199
trends you can see definitely that

72
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,520
flower is

73
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,560
a little bit more variable overall

74
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
trending upwards

75
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,719
as it progresses in the leaf really not

76
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:32,000
a whole lot and upper leaves having

77
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,080
more delta nine thc accumulation

78
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
than lower leaves but both showing a

79
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,000
little bit of an increase a little bit

80
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
of this bump up

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,120
here from day 50 to day 55.

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,719
now that thc content we're looking at

83
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,719
the content of these samples from both

84
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,800
strains increased in floral samples with

85
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,919
increasing time post induction

86
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,800
in leaf samples delta 19 levels decrease

87
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,839
slightly during the same period so as we

88
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,680
saw there

89
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,598
when it's relatively the same if we just

90
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,719
look here again relatively the same but

91
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,799
it does have a slight

92
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,280
decrease here definitely not as dramatic

93
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,599
as we saw with the change in the flower

94
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,759
there there's an increase in those so

95
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,598
the content variability well

96
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,919
considerable variation of the delta nine

97
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,119
thc content and floral samples at each

98
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,039
time point was

99
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,158
collection was noted i tried to show

100
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,560
that with the large

101
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,079
error bars there on the graph multiple

102
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,080
flowers were collected from different

103
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,879
parts of the plant to generate an

104
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
average now thc content related to

105
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,318
location

106
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,039
on the actual plant well floral samples

107
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:32,719
from the top

108
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,560
or high portion of the plant have higher

109
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,959
levels of delta 9 thc

110
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
than floral samples from lower portions

111
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,360
of the plant

112
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
and this can kind of correlate with the

113
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
amount of light they're getting exposed

114
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
to versus the

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,158
lower buds down here this is why some

116
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,920
growers choose pruning methods that try

117
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:48,639
to get as many buds kind of pointed

118
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,199
towards the

119
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,039
light there as possible try to maximize

120
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,719
their cannabinoid production in those

121
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,039
floral parts

122
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,639
now a consistent pattern of accumulation

123
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,400
was observed in the sense that the same

124
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,798
pattern of accumulation was observed in

125
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,799
two

126
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,719
additional strains as presented in the

127
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,519
research increasing the biological

128
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,318
replication

129
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,080
of this observation the delta nine thc

130
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:10,719
content was highest in flowers in the

131
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,040
upper

132
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,400
third lowest in the flowers from the

133
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,238
lower third

134
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,600
and intermediate in flowers in the

135
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,560
middle third to kind of give you that

136
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,560
idea that you're going to have the

137
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
greatest amount of thc

138
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,918
middle amount and then your lowest

139
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,280
amount if you're looking at really

140
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,560
trying to prime

141
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,879
and pick that prime flower for the

142
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,000
highest levels of cannabinoid

143
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,519
accumulation

144
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,839
so with this in this kind of data here

145
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,359
provides you kind of an extra incentive

146
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,159
to keep those buds pointed towards the

147
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,639
light

148
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,759
to maximize that cannabinoid production

149
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,759
there for you
