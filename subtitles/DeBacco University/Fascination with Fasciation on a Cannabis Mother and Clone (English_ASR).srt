1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,160
in this debacle University video we're

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,080
going to look at fascination with

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,820
fasciation on a cannabis mother and

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,620
clone plant we're going to hear from

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,839
Connor out from the greenhouse to show

6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:14,160
us one of the plants that is going

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,079
through and cloning as you can see in

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,899
the picture here to see if we can

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,899
perpetuate this fasciation trait

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,859
[Music]

11
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,719
all right well first off I should Define

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,759
this in fasciation if you're not aware

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,280
is really Define its development of

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,259
elongated flattened in stems on a plant

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,079
we can clearly see that here compared to

16
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,878
the normal this can be also expressed in

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,980
the flowers from the apical part of the

18
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,899
of the plant we can see this one in

19
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,459
comparison to the normal one dandelions

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,500
can also have this so we can see the

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,179
normal dandelions in the background with

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,259
this fasciation one here in the

23
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,359
foreground

24
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,399
now is this good or bad particularly

25
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,259
related to cannabis well typically it's

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
not considered to be advantageous other

27
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,238
than a unique ornamental characteristics

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,518
however in cannabis this change in

29
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,438
flower morphology can lead to some

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,260
interest and we can see all these plants

31
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,759
exhibit a fasciation now the question is

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,240
you know is this good or is this bad

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,880
definitely is looking very unique

34
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,079
so what are some potential causes for

35
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,899
this to get it kind of like the root

36
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,519
cause is what this might occur well this

37
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,500
is typically the result of a genetic

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,000
mutation of the meristematic region of

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,579
the plant remember meristematic region

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,200
is the area of high cell division this

41
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,819
is evident by the elongated and

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,100
flattened cells this is kind of what the

43
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,078
top of the plant looks like right here

44
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,699
as seen in the example here it's the

45
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:40,500
apical meristem showing the change in

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,000
this morphology and it's really not

47
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,379
shown on the side branches and you'll

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,239
see that in a moment with Connor out in

49
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,219
the greenhouse since this occurrence is

50
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,259
typically isolated it could be pruned

51
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,239
out after grower decided but in this

52
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,700
case the grower has attempted to clone

53
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,019
it for the future to see if this trait

54
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,420
will continue

55
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,859
now does fasciation equal a super bud

56
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,200
you know we're seeing this change in

57
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,519
morphology in that apical meristem well

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,520
is that going to make a super Bud well

59
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,098
typically uh the apical Bud the top bud

60
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,139
can initially look very impressive but

61
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,699
often the actual development is quite

62
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,979
poor so what it may look like it might

63
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,560
be a super dense Bud sometimes though

64
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,419
there is a lack of density due to Rarity

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,159
there is the reason for the cloning is

66
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,719
to Simply increase the sample size to

67
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,299
see if this is if this initial

68
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:26,219
observation repeats itself however even

69
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,080
if it could structured superbud was to

70
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,580
develop you have to keep in mind that

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,500
the odds of botritis would likely be

72
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,599
much greater so extra attention would

73
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,000
have to be taken for this plant to

74
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,780
ensure you're not losing this unique

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,878
quality to a botrytis or a bud rot mold

76
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,680
so let's go out to Cotter and see what

77
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,859
he has to show us with the fasciation

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,080
plant we've seen in the greenhouse

79
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,879
hello everyone once again we are back

80
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,219
here in the greenhouse

81
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,859
um we're here looking at our fascinated

82
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:57,300
plants again our mutations

83
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,060
um here we have

84
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,819
one of our original fasciated plants you

85
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,920
can see it started down way down here it

86
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,060
started getting wide started thinning

87
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,759
out

88
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,199
and if you follow along up

89
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,419
you can see

90
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,939
it only keeps getting wider

91
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,799
it's around two and a half inches almost

92
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,500
getting to three and it actually up here

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,939
started to curl in on itself almost like

94
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,459
a piece of celery

95
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,539
there's a crease that goes down the

96
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,640
middle

97
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:30,299
and that eventually follows all the way

98
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,559
up to this new apical meristem growth

99
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,300
and this

100
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,280
this plant specifically

101
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,159
has some of the most unique growth

102
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,439
because there's no fasciation on any of

103
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,539
the side branches coming out look at the

104
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,859
difference between the thickness of that

105
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:47,939
main stem

106
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,180
and this Branch it's it's absurd

107
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:53,280
and once again if you look up to the top

108
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,900
near the apical Marathon you can see how

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,459
bushy it's really getting

110
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,860
compared to a normal standard growth

111
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,658
I'm a little nervous as it as it starts

112
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,620
to Bud that we might be running into

113
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:07,259
some

114
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,939
humidity moisture issues with this large

115
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,739
mass of growth but I'm going to watch it

116
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,359
carefully and make sure to thin out any

117
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,580
leaves that I need to

118
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,659
but it is just a beautiful work of

119
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,819
nature

120
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:20,399
and if you want a little

121
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,418
comparison for size that is a quarter

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,779
sitting

123
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:27,079
in the middle of the stem it just looks

124
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,079
crazy

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,139
yeah I look forward to what what this

126
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:37,978
plant comes to um I'm hoping for a

127
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:40,500
fairly unique kind of wide flower nice

128
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,659
big bud but once again I do have to

129
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,680
worry about those moisture issues as it

130
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,380
does

131
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,680
Bush up some more

132
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,620
welcome back guys we're here looking at

133
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,139
um our fasciated plants again

134
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,240
these mutations along the stem were so

135
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,879
unique that I decided that I wanted to

136
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,300
try to continue on the Legacy

137
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,918
and well I did

138
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,579
um here we have two clones

139
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:10,139
these are baox strain a high CBD variety

140
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:14,519
and they were taken

141
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:16,620
from this fascinated Branch right here

142
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,459
and if you look at these clones they

143
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,478
have

144
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:24,478
continued to fasciate they have these

145
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,740
long wide stems that are really strong

146
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,560
and dense

147
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,600
you see how thick it really is

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,600
when you get those angles

149
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,939
both clones are exhibiting this feature

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,280
this one almost already like a half an

151
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:41,639
inch wide when in reality it should only

152
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,619
be millimeters thick at this point

153
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,019
and I'm really trying to keep these

154
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,300
going and possibly get a whole Bay of

155
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,399
fascinated plants if possible

156
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,720
I love this mutation and I can't wait to

157
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,719
see what it does once it fully flowers
