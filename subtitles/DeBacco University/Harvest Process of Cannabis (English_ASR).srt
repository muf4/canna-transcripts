1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,160
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,160
going to go over the harvest process

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,400
of cannabis going to give you some

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,879
options such as whole plant or selective

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,400
as well as an indoor and an outdoor

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,880
environment example

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,080
so you can try to apply this process and

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,080
be thinking about

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:29,919
your chosen path when you go to

10
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:31,358
considering harvesting cannabis plants

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,359
all right let's get into the harvest

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,880
process of cannabis and remember those

13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,238
real world examples

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,920
we provided at the end here so first off

15
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,439
even before you get into harvest while

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
many growers focus on the harvest

17
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,359
process

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,120
remember that before you begin the

19
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,159
process of harvesting you should have

20
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,000
the next step

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,398
all set to go and that next step very

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
important drying and curing process

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,920
make sure you have that set up before

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,600
you start taking any plants down

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,120
there's no sense harvesting if you're

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
not ready to move the material through

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,280
the final phases of the process

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,000
simply because you have a greater chance

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,198
of losing

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,079
that crop and material there so how do

31
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,079
you determine

32
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,599
when to harvest when's the best time to

33
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,519
harvest well this comes from an

34
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,359
inspection of the buds themselves

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,359
a combination of stigma and trichome

36
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,478
development is used to pinpoint the peak

37
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,879
harvest times

38
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,719
if you want to see some representative

39
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,920
images of both the stigma the trichome

40
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,920
looking at the bud size

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,680
and development there are other videos

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,478
on this channel that can help you with

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,400
that

44
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,319
in short though when the stigmas are tan

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
brown coloration and the trichomes are

46
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,118
mostly cloudy with a few starting to

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
turn amber color

48
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,560
this is typically a sign that the

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,719
harvest time is basically

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,079
quote unquote now when you're kind of

51
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,759
seeing that age of development that's

52
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,359
kind of that peak harvest time

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,959
and you want everything set up for the

54
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,399
drying and caring phase ahead of that

55
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,879
so when you get to this you can go

56
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,879
through with the harvest process

57
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,078
so preparing the plants preparing the

58
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,599
growers as well

59
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,759
when you determine that the plants are

60
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,280
close to harvest time be sure to allow

61
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,478
some time to flush them when you're only

62
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,879
giving them water

63
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,718
and not nutrients to remove any excess

64
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,679
buildups of nutrients or salts in the

65
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,158
root zone

66
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,680
also by just giving them water you're

67
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,319
reducing your input cost

68
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,920
without impacting your yield for more

69
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,719
information on that again more other

70
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,238
videos

71
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,080
keep in mind that this is applied to

72
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,520
both indoor and outdoor operations as

73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,120
well as hydroponics

74
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,879
uh hydropodox you have the shortest

75
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,280
duration of flush time

76
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,560
and for soil you're with a higher clay

77
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,919
base you're gonna have the longest

78
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,039
duration of time

79
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,958
between uh for flushing

80
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,959
so we need to move uh we need to have

81
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,400
more than just the plants uh be sure you

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,878
have the following on hand to make the

83
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,640
harvest pricing as efficient as possible

84
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,799
you need to have pruners a transport

85
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,878
surface as well as time and labor

86
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
to go through the actual process of

87
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,840
taking down the plants

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,519
harvesting them now there will be other

89
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,120
videos on what trims and dry trims that

90
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,120
you can look at in this channel

91
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,719
as far as doing the final detail trim as

92
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,759
we see here but just taking the plants

93
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,199
down can be quite labor intensive

94
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,959
so those pruners that i had mentioned

95
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,719
when we were talking pruners or when i'm

96
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,479
mentioning pruners i'm talking something

97
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,080
more like the image here

98
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,840
they're used for cutting back branches

99
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
and are different from scissors

100
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,878
that are used more for detail work so i

101
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,518
consider these to be

102
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,878
scissors these are more your pruners

103
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,239
they're typically the rough and tough

104
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,679
plant takedown tools

105
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,000
they're especially useful for moving the

106
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519
central stem on that ground level

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,639
on smaller plants and larger plants

108
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,319
you're kind of cutting that plant down

109
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,798
that you're going to use pruners for

110
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,000
your scissors i consider to be more your

111
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,959
detailed trimmers

112
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,158
for example now that transport surface

113
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,759
that i had mentioned

114
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,280
since you're likely to have the growing

115
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,079
location separate from the drying

116
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,759
location

117
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,760
a method of moving the plants needs to

118
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,280
be implemented depending on the size of

119
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,598
the harvest and distance this can

120
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,280
involve a trailer or even a cart

121
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,959
in either situation the goal is to have

122
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,199
a clean surface

123
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,319
and to not overly pack the plants during

124
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,000
transport to avoid

125
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,759
physically damaging the plants during

126
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,759
this process

127
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,120
some go with like cattle trailers and

128
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,039
actually hang plants right

129
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,200
in there others will go with selective

130
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,158
bins so all of these are different

131
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,479
options

132
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,598
but the key part or consistency with all

133
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,798
these is clean

134
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,560
we have to wash them out between

135
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,680
transport and not really kind of like

136
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,280
packing them in there

137
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,120
you're kind of kind of loosely putting

138
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,080
them here or even hanging them

139
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,719
are both good options and as i mentioned

140
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,519
the time

141
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,879
and labor so having an idea of the scale

142
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,680
of your operation which we'll see in

143
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,319
some

144
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,319
videos here showing indoor and outdoor

145
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,399
scale the operation is important

146
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,000
and the plants you determine to be ready

147
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,560
for harvest make sure you have enough

148
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
time in helping hands to get the job

149
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
done

150
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
often this is a labor intensive process

151
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
so be sure to pace your progress and

152
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,680
keep an eye on everyone

153
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
for both typically to make sure that

154
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
plants are being harvested in the way

155
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
you want

156
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,040
but also just a good practice to keep an

157
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,399
eye on everyone that's working for you

158
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,160
i make sure no one gets lost or

159
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,079
dehydrated or heat stroke or anything

160
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,199
like that so again keep that in mind as

161
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,439
well

162
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,879
now we've got two ways we can harvest uh

163
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,560
pro campus in general

164
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,560
we have the whole plant harvest and then

165
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
we also have selective plant harvest

166
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
well whole plant harvest the advantages

167
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,560
is allows for clearing the entire plant

168
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,240
material

169
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,079
all at the same time which is great

170
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,038
makes for easy planning and clearing of

171
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,680
the area

172
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,959
great if the planned end product is uh

173
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,079
concentrates because you're taking all

174
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,560
the buds all the fla

175
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,079
all the plants at the same time the

176
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,000
disadvantage is it's the most labor

177
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,519
intensive of the harvesting options

178
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,959
and all the plant material has to be

179
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,478
handled at the same time and it's going

180
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,279
to be very difficult to kind of

181
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,599
hang and dry entire plants but as we can

182
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,038
see in this image it is possible

183
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,520
the other option if it doesn't sound

184
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,519
like it fits your operation we have also

185
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,879
going on to selective plant harvest so

186
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,839
this allows growers to select

187
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,279
only the buds at their prime can provide

188
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,439
the opportunity for other buds to

189
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,079
continue to develop and ideally get more

190
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,079
yield

191
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,918
in the same area however the

192
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,680
disadvantage does require multiple times

193
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,439
to go through the plants and harvest

194
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,560
and time and care needed to be taken to

195
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,800
carefully remove

196
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,839
only those buds that are at the peak of

197
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,280
harvest

198
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,119
so you've now you've learned about these

199
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,399
methods you have an idea about the kind

200
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,800
of harvest process

201
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,478
now i'm going to go into both an outdoor

202
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,520
and an indoor operation

203
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:10,079
so you can get an idea of applying what

204
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,879
method you might choose to these actual

205
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,639
real world

206
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,639
situations so i hope you enjoy

207
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
now keep in mind this is field grown so

208
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,719
you are going to have some natural

209
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
variability especially growing this many

210
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,520
plants with some very

211
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,280
with the variable of the weather and

212
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,639
reaction to maybe the transplant of

213
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,279
going into containers

214
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,560
but overall i can see that there's

215
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,318
definitely this

216
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,079
great kind of transition from the

217
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,560
vegetative stage right to the flower

218
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,399
stage

219
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,918
and now getting to late flower stage

220
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,159
which will soon progress

221
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,519
to the harvest stage and that will lead

222
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,960
to the drying and curing

223
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:49,279
stage as well so this is a nice kind of

224
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,879
view here of just kind of the end of the

225
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,399
season harvest there

226
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,918
and we'll look some of these buds a

227
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,279
little bit closer up here so you can get

228
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,279
that appreciation

229
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,159
for exactly what all these plants have

230
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,000
gone through and are producing

231
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,680
so here we are out in the field looking

232
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,918
at the development of the buds and

233
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,519
assessing how far along they are

234
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,120
and we can see looking at some of the

235
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,478
leaves near the buds we're seeing that

236
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,199
coloration that amber

237
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,399
kind of change to the leaves we're also

238
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,598
going to be getting into

239
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,799
looking at the actual bud themselves

240
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,279
now we're seeing a full kind of

241
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,199
development here we're noticing we're

242
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,119
going to get a little closer view here

243
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,120
of the actual stigmas to see how they're

244
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,519
actually looking and they're developing

245
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,199
quite

246
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,639
long we're seeing a lot of that brown

247
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,000
coloration indicating

248
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,519
they're kind of nearing that end of

249
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,199
development now we don't want to always

250
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,519
compare to what's around us because it

251
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,598
can

252
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,120
depend on the planting time of the

253
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:39,759
actual crop depending a little bit on

254
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,918
the weather

255
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,000
but looking behind me we see the leaves

256
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,359
turning so this is a sign that

257
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
we're having that reduction in light

258
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,960
that change in photo period and that's

259
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,319
signaling these plants to go through and

260
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,318
develop

261
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
now here as we're taking a real specific

262
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,598
look at this bud in particular

263
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,598
you definitely see some of the

264
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,319
development that is occurring and the

265
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,360
degree

266
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,960
of development that's occurring now

267
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,598
those leaves definitely getting some of

268
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,680
that little purple coloration to them

269
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,800
indicating we are getting to the colder

270
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,560
times of the year

271
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,160
indicating hopefully also those

272
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,879
infosight might be as just a stress

273
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,039
response

274
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,479
and some some varieties will produce

275
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:17,918
more of that purple

276
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,359
however we're really looking at is kind

277
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,598
of the stigma and hopefully the

278
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,120
development of trichomes with the loop

279
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,120
and we're noticing here that we're

280
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,240
getting that kind of brown coloration to

281
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,680
the very end

282
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,360
that's a sign that we're getting near

283
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,720
that end of development

284
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,080
okay that this bud's going to be ready

285
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
to harvest pretty soon

286
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,599
here's another bud on the same plant

287
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,200
also inspecting this one

288
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,800
not the apical meristem this is one of

289
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,039
the side branches

290
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,719
but we can see continued and consistent

291
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,399
development which is great to see

292
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
realizing that this may not get to the

293
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,879
full development that we saw the first

294
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,879
one

295
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,879
but definitely seeing very consistent

296
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,720
colorations very consistent stigma

297
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,679
development so again it may not reach

298
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,320
the full size

299
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,239
as the apical meristem but definitely

300
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,240
progressing along the same

301
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,519
progression that we saw the apocalypse

302
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,560
and indicating this plant might be

303
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,240
harvested

304
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,838
all around the same time which makes it

305
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,440
great from a grower standpoint

306
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,440
we don't have to go through and harvest

307
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
all the individual buds at separate time

308
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,000
tables

309
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,000
so this is that little zoom out here

310
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,839
looking at the whole plant

311
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,839
and the many located behind this one

312
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,360
so overall here you can see in total in

313
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,799
this grow space it's about 6 000

314
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,480
plants so it's harvest time

315
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:42,000
which is a busy time and sometimes you

316
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,519
can be a victim

317
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,919
of your own success but just keep going

318
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,519
through

319
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,079
keep harvesting and hopefully you'll be

320
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,919
rewarded

321
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,920
in the end with a very successful crop

322
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,839
and there's plenty of work to do here

323
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,360
that we can see so as we're going

324
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
through the greenhouse here we can see

325
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,039
all of the plants

326
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,519
see kind of this greenhouse environment

327
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,919
have some fans on for air circulation

328
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,639
try to prune those lower leaves out now

329
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,278
we are getting close to the harvest time

330
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,319
so we are seeing the buds developing and

331
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,320
here we see the

332
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,600
upper portions being where the light is

333
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,240
exposed and of course

334
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,959
that's where most of the prime or apical

335
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,399
buds

336
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,559
are positioned see some lights there

337
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,240
those lights are there for early stage

338
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,000
growth and if it's cloudy out

339
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,159
offers a little supplemental light the

340
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
main light source for these plants

341
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,759
is of course the sun which makes this

342
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,600
greenhouse environment very

343
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,360
energy efficient now there is some heat

344
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,320
and cooling of course and some lights as

345
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
you can see

346
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
but for the most part the sun is the

347
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,639
energy now utilizing that sun we see the

348
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,720
screen of green method here where all

349
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,600
those buds have kind of been pruned

350
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,000
and kind of directed to go through that

351
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,159
mesh

352
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,078
material and that mesh material allows

353
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,000
them to support themselves allows a

354
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,239
great way to be able to support

355
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,639
all those plant materials to try to

356
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,200
maintain these those apical buds

357
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,199
so they get the maximum amount of light

358
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,759
and that's why we saw earlier the lower

359
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,440
portions

360
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,159
being pruned out with the leaves now

361
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,560
there are about 6 000 plants here

362
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,679
so quite a lot to take care of getting

363
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,719
ready to harvest

364
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,359
so there is a lot of work to come

365
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,839
with the harvest process of all of these

366
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,839
plants
