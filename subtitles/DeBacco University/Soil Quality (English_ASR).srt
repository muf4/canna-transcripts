1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,679
okay I'm gonna go over so quality and

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:06,899
the take-home quote here is treat your

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:09,058
soil soil well and it will return the

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,219
favor to you so you want to be careful

5
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:13,169
and mindful of your soil I don't want to

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,599
mess it up and ideally the crops you get

7
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:19,140
off it will be more than bountiful for

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,000
ya so obvious question is just what is

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,500
soil quality well it's a combination of

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,329
things it's often referred to as soil

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,000
health but really more properly called

12
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,799
soil quality in this soil health is kind

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,509
of the physical properties your soil the

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,009
chemical properties and the biological

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,140
properties and how they all interact and

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,820
overlap that little portion right here

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,700
in the middle would be your soil health

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,530
or so qualities we're going to call it

19
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,800
so first off what is soil well soil is

20
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,710
or should be about fifty percent mineral

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,390
25 percent air and 25 percent of water

22
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,058
just gives you hundred percent now

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,820
whether you have clay or silty clay or

24
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,589
silt loam or silt or sandy loam depends

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,420
on the percent clay the percent silt and

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,390
the percent sand that you have in your

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,160
soil you'll notice the percent clay has

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,859
a large bearing on what type of soil it

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,688
is clay is very small particles and they

30
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,819
influence the properties of soil quite a

31
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:11,239
bit now good for growing conditions that

32
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,169
they said here's the 50/25/25 split

33
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,699
compacted soil though you'll notice a

34
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,000
greater percentage of the solid and

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,670
poorly drained soil has more water and

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,200
also that same percentage solid but more

37
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,579
percentage of water and that's your

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,710
water a lot of your air percentage goes

39
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,060
down so these are some conditions you

40
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:28,618
may have experienced or have fields that

41
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,590
have this but ideally you're trying to

42
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,030
shoot for that 50/25/25 split if you get

43
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,920
the soil test free back and they say

44
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,930
silty loam well this gives you an idea

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,549
on this triangle of what percentage clay

46
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,299
silt and sand that you do have in your

47
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,500
soil balance is the key regardless of

48
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,290
soil you're talking about

49
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,340
so the key part of yours to be balanced

50
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,430
there's a lot of different things going

51
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,359
on not as simple as just one one kind of

52
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,950
leg here of the lever could be multiple

53
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,840
things going on so looking at the

54
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,850
results you get back from the lab it's

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,799
important to realize what's high value

56
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,019
somewhere are low values and the goals

57
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,030
to have a balanced soil so you want to

58
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:08,519
bring the low values up without adding

59
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,530
even greater amounts of nutrients to the

60
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,550
high values and is it difficult

61
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,979
balancing yeah and there's some

62
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:17,040
give-and-take within everything

63
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:19,009
so quality this is gives you an idea of

64
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,199
the complexities the Moltres chart

65
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:23,969
what's in antagonism or synergistic with

66
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,530
certain nutrients and how you affect one

67
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:28,560
and how it affects all the others

68
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,090
this is going to get very complex I can

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,830
be very hard to understand at least

70
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,840
initially there's micronutrients in

71
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,120
hearing there's some major nutrients and

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,069
how they all interact but as I showed in

73
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,049
the last minutes that balancing act that

74
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:41,310
you're trying to maintain you don't want

75
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,099
to just look at one and just raise one

76
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,620
by increasing one you're also going to

77
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,298
potentially affect some others so just

78
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,739
important to keep that in mind and when

79
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:53,760
in doubt start on the low end because

80
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,739
you can always add more so more is not

81
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,078
better as I said you want to turn the

82
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,370
low end excessive amounts of some

83
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,110
nutrients can restrict plant growth

84
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,150
negatively impact the environment and

85
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,540
basically cause you unnecessary expenses

86
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,769
we have a deficiency range here and a

87
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,989
critical arrange in that sufficiency

88
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,849
range so you wanna yours your yields are

89
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,009
increasing the certain point that

90
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:15,598
sufficient arranger doesn't change if

91
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:16,979
you keep adding nutrients at this point

92
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,349
you get to this toxic range you could

93
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,280
actually have a reduction in the elds so

94
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,739
your goal is to reach that critical

95
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,859
level that's at the point what we call

96
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,730
no fertilizers response is likely so up

97
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:28,290
to this point you keep that in

98
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,328
fertilizer your percent yield keeps

99
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:31,858
going up then there's a certain point

100
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:33,750
and this would be the exact point here

101
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,280
we're adding more fertilizer it does not

102
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,709
give you more yield just increases your

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,180
cost in your time and you're destined so

104
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,920
you want to try to be as close to here

105
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,109
as possible now if you overshoot a

106
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,488
little bit that's okay if you understood

107
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,540
a little bit that can be okay too if you

108
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,400
had some fertilize you can bring it back

109
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:49,108
up the key part is to know when you're

110
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,000
close or protein that critical level

111
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:54,959
because if you go too high could really

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,030
cause some issues so what do I add to my

113
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,170
soil there's liquid versions of some

114
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,090
nutrients there's wettable powders

115
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:02,369
there's granular which one do I choose

116
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,280
well they all have pros and cons to them

117
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,039
on the liquid the pro is it's really

118
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,689
easy to measure typically or run through

119
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,400
an injector easily and we'll see to talk

120
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:13,799
about drip irrigation and fertilizer

121
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,269
injectors however the downfall to

122
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,340
liquids is that they shouldn't feed it

123
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,139
any point in their life so storage of

124
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,089
them could be an issue they take up

125
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,819
large volumes to Neph gallons

126
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,168
five-gallon storage and often there's

127
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,189
just stabilized or in and that could

128
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:29,199
settle over time that's

129
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,610
you're saving a year-to-year a lot of

130
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,289
times you'll see a little bit of a layer

131
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,400
developing the bottom I want to try to

132
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,629
shake them and stir them it's midwinter

133
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,219
just to go through they're not settling

134
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:41,620
out so they don't lose that stabilizer

135
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,800
still over time it's hesitancy to drop

136
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,449
that a solution that can be an issue

137
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,370
multiple powders they don't sell over

138
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:51,009
time they're great small volume for

139
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,139
storage but the cons is it can be messy

140
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,509
and hard to measure often require

141
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,889
pre-mixing before tank mix and kind of

142
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:58,209
like making the chocolate milk should

143
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,300
put it in the container here shake it up

144
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:02,469
before you add it to the glass here so

145
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,020
it can be a little bit harder than next

146
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,420
I'll put the ranges they store small and

147
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:10,120
they don't settle over time then we get

148
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,530
to granular these are easily broadcast

149
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,439
no special equipment needed literally

150
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:16,509
can take a gloves and a pail and go and

151
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,509
spread them they can't be fed through an

152
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:21,039
irrigation system for the irrigation to

153
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,930
interfere again it's not possible as

154
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,280
granular there's different size we know

155
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,990
there's some larger particles are some

156
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,479
smaller particles think of it like

157
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,460
applying sand and that can be

158
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,520
advantageous I tend to be cheaper and

159
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:35,889
bought in larger quantities when you're

160
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,089
looking at soil health or so quality pH

161
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,159
should be your number-one concern

162
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:41,139
typically Connecticut ourselves acidic

163
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,780
and we have two types of lime

164
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,699
so all I'm is not treated the same just

165
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:47,649
assume the line needs to be added every

166
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,659
year I've had some fields that do need

167
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:51,789
to be lightened on every year somewhere

168
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,550
every other year summer every fifth year

169
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:57,520
some you fertilize once with lime and

170
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,650
you're kind of done I caution you about

171
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,799
using wood ash this can dress lee

172
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:05,109
increase your ph it's great at raising

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,689
your pH but it can add it to become too

174
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,879
high in two eyes just as bad as too low

175
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:13,120
we're shooting for just slightly acidic

176
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:15,100
6.8 for most crops 6.5 is our goal

177
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,439
most native soils we can be hovering

178
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,390
around five some cases a little bit low

179
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,639
or some case a little bit higher or

180
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:24,250
tsun4 around that neutral adding wood

181
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,339
ash I've seen soil approaching 10 which

182
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,050
causes all sorts of other issues when

183
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:30,609
we're adjusting our pH using lime the

184
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,710
two types are dolomitic which is

185
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,580
commonly called agricultural lime and

186
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:38,469
this is high in magnesium it's about 12%

187
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,579
magnesium and there's calcitic or garden

188
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,800
lime and this is a lower magna

189
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:44,839
seem content so if your magnesiums

190
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,090
already high you could be looking at

191
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:50,628
more of a calcitic or a garden lime to

192
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:52,568
be adding to your particular soil NPK

193
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:54,800
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium

194
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,990
nitrogen and put in parentheses here we

195
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,569
determined that with a nitrate test kind

196
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,360
of a little difficult special test to

197
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:04,098
kind of go through and follow do nitrate

198
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,889
tests that want to do to get true

199
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:07,848
analysis of your soil nitrate levels

200
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,310
phosphorus want a caution it's a

201
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:12,259
freshwater contaminant if you over add

202
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,668
phosphorus yes--it's will say it's

203
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:16,098
important for roots and getting them

204
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:18,168
growing with you over add phosphorus it

205
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:22,310
can contaminate fresh groundwater wells

206
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:24,318
in area ponds potassium K is commonly

207
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,199
needed can be pulled out of soil pretty

208
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,830
readily by some crops you show up as a

209
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,348
deficiency in some some areas some other

210
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:34,728
macronutrients calcium lime does contain

211
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:36,468
calcium but for the most part it's not

212
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:38,060
really plant available so it looks like

213
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:40,459
in the raw form it's kind of a silvery

214
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,889
look to it magnesium they talked about

215
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:44,359
can be an issue with Tomatoes epsom

216
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,908
salts is great for that for the

217
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,038
magnesium or dolomitic lime if your

218
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:51,228
soils low in it also epson salts gave

219
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,620
you some sulfur which may be more of a

220
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:53,628
concern

221
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,838
due to lack of acid rain were receiving

222
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:59,270
back we had a lot of acid rain coming

223
00:07:56,838 --> 00:08:01,009
from some of the power plants out in the

224
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:03,560
Midwest they since have cleaned up their

225
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:05,718
stacks as we rose less sulfuric acid

226
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,519
because the acid rain was sulfuric acid

227
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,949
it was raining down and some fields were

228
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,448
getting quote free sulfur now that we're

229
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,009
getting that as much acid rain we're not

230
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,228
getting that free sulfur we can't took

231
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:17,060
for granted in some cases so certain

232
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:20,139
instances you may see low sulfur not

233
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,139
necessary in the large scale

234
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,710
micronutrients are also important not to

235
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,810
over add a lot of people get hung up in

236
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:29,658
the micronutrients your irons your

237
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,848
manganese your Boron's your coppers your

238
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:33,500
zinc your chlorides don't really focus

239
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:35,000
on days after you get your pH

240
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,408
straightened out in your macro

241
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,629
straightened out then you can move to

242
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:41,208
these they're typically bear deterrent I

243
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:44,088
a test of the leaves not to say a soil

244
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:46,429
and overall ation of your focus rarely

245
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:48,050
is a problem on their own I have seen

246
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:50,708
growers over add these and get into

247
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:52,759
issues I kind of use the association of

248
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:54,019
micronutrients consider them to be like

249
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,819
a spice

250
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,470
you can take a perfectly good steak and

251
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,150
over spice it and it will taste horrible

252
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,460
same thing here you can take a

253
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:04,569
micronutrient and over at it and it can

254
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,190
really cause havoc on the plants in soil

255
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,050
cell micronutrients while living in them

256
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,130
odds are very low this is a problem and

257
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,079
some growers are asking you all below

258
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:16,309
should I test for molybdenum

259
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,450
no it's such a small amount if it's in a

260
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:20,299
fertilizer it typically comes with a

261
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,620
warning to may be harmful of ruminant

262
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:24,529
animals for foraging grass where

263
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:28,850
applications have been made this I found

264
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:31,250
online here was the link on the

265
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,690
description to look in the resources

266
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,429
there this is what it would look like

267
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,190
but really it mimics a lot of other

268
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:40,609
things and in our area I have never seen

269
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,980
this really to be a problem microbiology

270
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,320
also getting a lot of talk driven by the

271
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,000
hobbyist gardeners stick to some of the

272
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,530
basics have some supporting evidence

273
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,090
more than just the manufacturers

274
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,120
brochures there's a lot of advertising

275
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,889
saying this is the best micronutrient if

276
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,759
you add this guaranteed to get bigger

277
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:59,929
crops not always the case so you want to

278
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,039
make sure your pH and your

279
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:03,609
macronutrients is straightened out

280
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,230
before you start moving to microbiology

281
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,840
some examples of some of her beneficial

282
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,190
bacteria actinovate Aizaz companion

283
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,530
there's some examples here

284
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,240
these tend have some a little bit more

285
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,309
supporting evidence and some other ones

286
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,870
i've heard about so these might be worth

287
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:20,629
an initial look if you feel everything

288
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,360
else is straightened out for fungi roots

289
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:25,429
shielding mycorrhizae root shield is

290
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,039
root shield plus mycorrhizae is being

291
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:29,959
found in potting mixes too so this could

292
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:32,990
be some good beneficial fungi to look at

293
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,150
and target however earthworms can't be

294
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,860
overlooked they have many benefits be

295
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,419
kind to them and you'll get their free

296
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,620
castings you have to go out and buy any

297
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:41,120
they'll just work their way through the

298
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,039
soil and if they're happy you'll be

299
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,110
happy coffee grounds can be great way to

300
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,610
encourage the initial population you can

301
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,250
actually even grow them over the winter

302
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,330
and a slightly heated basement if you're

303
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,279
looking at something to do over the

304
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,560
winter n-- want to get a head start and

305
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,159
getting some earthworms for the area you

306
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:00,019
plan on growing in the spring

307
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,559
tillage disturbing the soil as little as

308
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,899
possible

309
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,279
till with a purpose i always say there's

310
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:07,110
different types of tillage or zone

311
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,970
there's chisel plow want to maintain us

312
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,829
she's didn't pay for city with the soil

313
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,290
in the plant keep living roots in your

314
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:14,309
soil and keep the soil covered mentioned

315
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:17,578
this in a couple of other videos with

316
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:19,049
cover crops and weed management but

317
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:21,059
tillage you want to remember that you

318
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,859
are disturbing the soil this can be good

319
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,328
if you have a purpose but just just keep

320
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,190
going through and keep beating up less

321
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:28,620
soil can I'm negative effects over the

322
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,079
long term how to maintain high quality

323
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,000
that species diversity in soil in plants

324
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,009
people in roots all year keep the soil

325
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,208
covered this can be a non invasive way

326
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:38,789
it's called a broad work if you have a

327
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:40,439
very small area basically jab this in

328
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:43,259
the ground after you put it in the

329
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,970
ground your rock it back and you just

330
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:46,528
break necessarily get some aeration in

331
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:50,040
without really turning or flipping the

332
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:51,480
soil tissue testing turnaround time is

333
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,740
important if you do want to go through

334
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,409
new tissue testing to determine your

335
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,389
plant health increased cost reduced time

336
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:59,458
between sampling result is worth the

337
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:00,990
price so if someone will turn the

338
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,578
results back and under a week and you

339
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,440
have to pay a little bit more that's

340
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:06,088
worth it because tissue testing you're

341
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,399
typically looking at a quick result to

342
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:12,089
fix a problem here we see it tomato leaf

343
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,769
on a bean leaf here exhibiting some of

344
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:16,560
these symptoms this is a nutrient this

345
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:18,600
is potassium in particular and you're

346
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,609
able to go through and have that be an

347
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,399
issue correct that with some liquid feed

348
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,889
again can save your crop so turnaround

349
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,049
time is important for the leaf analysis

350
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:30,120
if you do want to go this route again

351
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:32,189
start with the pH looking at that your

352
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,389
macronutrients once you get those in

353
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,060
line a lot of other things will come

354
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:37,980
together but there are other options the

355
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:40,698
key part is treat your soil well and

356
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,699
it'll treat you well
