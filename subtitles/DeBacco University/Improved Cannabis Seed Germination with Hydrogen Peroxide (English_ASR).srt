1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,559
so in this tobacco University video I'm

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,639
going to talk about how simple hydrogen

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,239
peroxide can be utilized to help

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,718
increase seed germination I'll tell you

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,880
what percentage to use based on the

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,320
research study and how you can achieve

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,118
that same concentration with various

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,118
products you might be

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,439
[Music]

10
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:28,359
purchasing all right let's look at how

11
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,079
improved cannabis seed germination with

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,320
hyen peroxide can be accom lished first

13
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,600
off giving you just a little background

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,960
on Growers usage of hydrogen peroxides

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,239
some Growers may use it as a simple pour

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,120
through it'll cause a lot of bubbling uh

17
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,799
this can be effective for root or

18
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,280
substrate based diseases but this

19
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,078
lecture really we're going to focus on

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,359
just the germination rates the some

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,198
Growers may already be utilizing this

22
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,439
particular product for other purposes H

23
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,439
peroxide is common uh it's used in most

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,920
first aid situations typically a 3%

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,558
solution as a mild antiseptic used to

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,239
prevent infection of minor cut scrapes

27
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:02,919
and burn Burns product works by

28
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:05,239
releasing oxygen when it's applied to

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,118
the defected area um and you see this

30
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,960
kind of bubble for foaming that occurs

31
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,599
remove the dead skin basically clean the

32
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,319
area and that's a sign that it's working

33
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,759
I do want to make note that if you are

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,399
purchasing concentrated hyen peroxide

35
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,799
typically 25 to

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,600
35% and you get that directly on your

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,280
skin it will cause it's a a burn uh

38
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,559
basically turns your skin white um as

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,879
seen in the image here so that's highly

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,399
concentrated that 3 % would just cause

41
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,158
the bubbling effect now with hydren

42
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,920
peroxide remember that light can break

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,079
it down so this is why it's typically

44
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,879
found in a light block bottle um because

45
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:43,478
that can reduce the concentration over

46
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,078
time and there's usually a used by datee

47
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,280
stated on it so keep that in mind if you

48
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,279
are choosing to utilize this particular

49
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,640
product so let's get to the research

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,560
article um here that talks about this um

51
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,879
germination um different cannabis seeds

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,439
soaked in different concentrations uh of

53
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,118
hydren peroxide

54
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:05,559
so here's some of the data that they

55
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,520
were looking at so the germination of

56
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,679
six-month-old seeds of blueberry of

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,719
cannabis Variety in concentrations of

58
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,959
hydron peroxide solution as well as a

59
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,280
water control so a here the top uh

60
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,640
picture here is represent photographs of

61
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,120
germination seeds and seedlings in H2O2

62
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,479
hyen peroxide for various concentrations

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,519
of water in day one day 2 day three and

64
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,639
day four so you can see their actual uh

65
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,680
data here so if we look at water right

66
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,958
AC process is what it looked like after

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,360
1 Day 2 days 3 days and 4 days and you

68
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,360
can see that in relation to the other

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,000
concentrations of Hy peroxide now down

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,239
here uh panel B is a comparison of the

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,080
germination percentages with those

72
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,640
different concentrations of hyon

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,080
peroxide and we could see here it kind

74
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,439
of puts the visualness of the data here

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,519
into actual numbers and we see something

76
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,239
very distinctive happen and that is the

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,239
middle bar here the second bar I should

78
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,800
say is the 1% and that has had the

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,480
quickest rate of germination compared to

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
the other concentrations and also the

81
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,759
water

82
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,000
control so then they took this up and

83
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:14,239
they did a 5-year-old seeds so D of

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,959
5-year-old seeds of the Finola and x59

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,360
varieties in 1% hyen peroxide solution

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,920
compared to the water control and we

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,200
could see again the water compared to

88
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,679
the two compared to the other two

89
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:30,238
varieties in 1% both uh varieties

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,319
responded very well to that 1% in that

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,280
comparison of germination and this was a

92
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,399
1% peroxide solution media and water

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,759
control is shown here in the mean with

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,080
five uh seeds being uh tried here each

95
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,878
replicate around 30 seeds were used in

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,439
total there give you a little comparison

97
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,239
there and always look at the article if

98
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:52,280
you want more of the details of

99
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,400
information so growth and survival of H

100
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,479
of hyon peroxide Solutions germinated in

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,039
an MS media so this is looking at more

102
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,679
of a um petri dish kind of look look at

103
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:05,078
but again same basic thing water over

104
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,079
Day from the first day they replaced all

105
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,000
so basically Day Zero to day one to day

106
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,000
three there so Day Zero is just after

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,479
transferred to the MS media plates after

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,560
they're soaking and then 24 hours after

109
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,159
and 72 hours um after transpl to that uh

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
medium there and that's just typical

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,400
petri dish General multi-purpose uh

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,879
media that was utilized there and we're

113
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,879
seeing the results yet again of that 1%

114
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,360
solution uh showing visually that best

115
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,478
rooting so what does the study conclude

116
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,199
what do you kind of like it to the the

117
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,839
bottom of the study here to improve

118
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,199
germination rates of your cannabis seeds

119
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,319
soak the seeds overnight in a 1% Hy

120
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,319
peroxide solution in a dark uh room at

121
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,240
room temperature this is a great for

122
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,279
situations that require stability such

123
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,680
as tissue culture so what the basically

124
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,879
this study concluded however how does

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,360
this kind of relate to your germination

126
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,839
rates how can this help uh benefit you

127
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,680
while some Growers May soak their seeds

128
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,198
overnight this is typically not often

129
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,160
advised though shown it can work uh but

130
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,759
this information still can be useful

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
simply instead of soaking your seeds in

132
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,439
plain water for whatever duration of

133
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,279
time you choose to use you can simply

134
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,199
add hydron peroxide to create a 1%

135
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,198
solution as you're soaking your seeds

136
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,120
and that can help improve your

137
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,319
germination rates so the question now

138
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,759
becomes is how do you get to that 1%

139
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,080
rate so I'm going to use the simple

140
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,479
chemistry here C1 V1 equals C2 V2

141
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,318
concentration of your starting stock

142
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:28,800
solution with your initial volume will

143
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,680
equal the concentration of your final

144
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,520
dilute solution with your final volume

145
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,519
so if you're using a typical bottle here

146
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:39,599
that's 3% if you have 16 o of that um

147
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,198
how do you get that 1% solution so in

148
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
short starting with your solution

149
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,560
there's three times as strong as you

150
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,400
need so taking 16 ounces of stock

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,439
solution adding 32 o of water will

152
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,638
result in 48 o total of a 1% solution

153
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,439
and you can see basically I went through

154
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,639
and calculated that right here basically

155
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,279
solving for v2 now another part here

156
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,519
what if you have that concentrated in

157
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,638
this case 32% food grade hydren peroxide

158
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,279
well if you're using that same 16 o of

159
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,918
the food grade hydren peroxide in short

160
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:13,038
you're going to be taking 16 ounces of

161
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:16,719
that stock solution and adding 496 o of

162
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:19,719
water which result in 512 o 4 gallons of

163
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,199
a 1% solution may be applicable on very

164
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,639
large scales but 4 gallons of a 1%

165
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,079
solution might be more than you need so

166
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,360
if you still have that same concentrated

167
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,680
solution and now you're only going to

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,879
use you know 2 ounces of that you know

169
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,240
percentage of water would you need to

170
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,319
add well 2 ounces of your stock solution

171
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,560
here 62 ounces of water would make a 64

172
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,000
probably more reasonable volume there of

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,079
a 1% solution that you can utilize to

174
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,319
soak your seeds in to help improve

175
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,680
germination rates so hope this helps if

176
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,520
you have this solution already give it a

177
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,478
try run the trial yourself see how it

178
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,719
helps out but start with that 1%

179
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:56,120
solution because that's what the data

180
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,120
shows is the most effective
