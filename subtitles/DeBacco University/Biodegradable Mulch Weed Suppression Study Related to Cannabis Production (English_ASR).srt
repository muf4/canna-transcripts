1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,198
if you're considering using

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,359
biodegradable mulch to suppress

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,278
weeds in your field this is a great

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,440
video because we're going to analyze

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,359
a research report and provide you some

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,080
information and hopefully some useful

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,759
information

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,320
so you can be able to apply this to your

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,210
own growing situation here on debaco

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,379
university

11
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,379
[Music]

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,560
all right let's get into biodegradable

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,278
mulch for weed suppression

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,079
study related to cannabis production so

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:34,558
first off this

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,480
is the research article so you're

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,759
welcome again take a look at it here

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,359
look at it for yourself

19
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,280
look at some of the details i'm just

20
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,799
going to provide a summary

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,120
so first off what was the study

22
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,519
objective well to study objective was to

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,038
evaluate the effectiveness of several

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,680
biodegradable mulches

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,160
on weed control and yield of processing

26
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,920
tomatoes in different areas of spain

27
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,919
the goal was to find an alternative to

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,600
standard black polyethylene mulch in

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,280
order to reduce the waste problem that

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
is generated from that product

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,359
this study investigated a field trial at

32
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,719
four locations in spain over three years

33
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,879
it was a randomized complete block

34
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,158
design with at least three replicates

35
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,478
of nine treatments so the tomatoes

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,320
being studied since a long-term study

37
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,280
regarding cannabis of this type does not

38
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,199
exist

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,280
in this example tomatoes are being used

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,118
as a crop of comparison

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,200
at the end of the study review based on

42
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,000
the results specific recommendations for

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,159
cannabis

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,280
production will be provided so again

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,079
even though this study was done for

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,359
tomatoes

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,319
they have their own specialties we're

48
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,680
going to try to relate this to cannabis

49
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,438
now the treatment study there's there

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,200
was nine and we could see them all

51
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,478
listed here with one being basically an

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,359
untreated control

53
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,560
one being manual weeding conventional

54
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,920
plastic mulch

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,920
and then different types of

56
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,719
biodegradable plastic mulch

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,640
as well as paper mulch were studied and

58
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,920
you can see the details listed here

59
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
you're welcome to pause the video and

60
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,960
again go through these in more detail

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,718
if it's of interest to you so we

62
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,478
densities at the four locations again

63
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,759
another great opportunity here to kind

64
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:04,640
of pause the video and kind of go

65
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,239
through that

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,599
we can see the different areas the

67
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,000
different years so this is what's great

68
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,758
about this

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,919
is we're seeing multiple years of

70
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,839
comparison the weed densities of main

71
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,958
weed species found in different years

72
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,280
and locations

73
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,719
in the untreated control plots 63 days

74
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,000
after transplanting

75
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,159
so again we're having some time for

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
those wheats to build up you see the

77
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,280
locations

78
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
we see the weed species we see the total

79
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,239
weeds listed

80
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
right here another great here

81
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,680
opportunity to pause the video and do a

82
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,079
little comparison

83
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,239
here we're going to move on so the weed

84
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,920
control 63 days post transplanting so

85
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
again now we're getting into

86
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,000
some more of the numbers here and that's

87
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,759
again what makes this study great

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,519
and allows you maybe if you find

89
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,359
something of interest to really go

90
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,039
through and look at the specifics and

91
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,480
see how that compares

92
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,400
here we're looking at the weed control

93
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,359
63 days after transplanting depending on

94
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
the treatment

95
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,760
for different locations and years now

96
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,560
what's just important to note

97
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,239
is that we've got our letters here and

98
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,759
if they all have the same letter so for

99
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,599
example this location

100
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,359
these should be considered not to be

101
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,719
statistically different

102
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,000
when we see different letters that's

103
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,959
where we start to see some of the

104
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,439
differences

105
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,800
in sorts of comparisons so just as a

106
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,719
quick example here

107
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,200
for this year across all these different

108
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,400
trials basically there was no difference

109
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,919
even though look at the numbers ago

110
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
they're different well we look at kind

111
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,559
of put it to a statistical test there's

112
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,439
really really

113
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,840
no difference this year no matter what

114
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,400
type

115
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,840
of sweet suppression you used other

116
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,120
locations you can see for the vast

117
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,360
majority very similar

118
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,799
we can see here barley straw vastly

119
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,440
different than any of the other

120
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,040
treatments

121
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,439
so that's how you kind of go about

122
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,519
reading this data table

123
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,039
income benefits in related tomato data

124
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
so we're looking at here cost

125
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,318
income in benefits here's our income

126
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,399
here's our benefit

127
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,919
and percent compared to polyethylene or

128
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,560
the standard plastic mulch

129
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,759
so in this example untreated controls

130
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,080
the percentage compared

131
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,878
would be under would be less than using

132
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,280
polyethylene

133
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,639
untreated just leaving it open see here

134
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,318
weeds sure definitely

135
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,679
added some competition and definitely

136
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,919
reduced yields

137
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,840
others we can see the polyethylene was

138
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,639
kind of that source of comparison

139
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,039
100 and we could see everything else was

140
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,119
of course

141
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,399
better than the untreated control but

142
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,639
didn't quite meet the

143
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,478
levels of polyethylene here for

144
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,319
comparison

145
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,839
now we'll get a category comparison so

146
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,599
biodegradable plastics

147
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,519
can be an alternative to polyethylene

148
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,320
due to the overall good weed control

149
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,839
in high in this case tomato yield paper

150
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,478
mulches do not perform as well

151
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,478
overall but are more diff and are more

152
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,360
difficult to apply and avoid

153
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,399
fracturing however these are the only

154
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,600
products that control

155
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,039
nutsage emergence so paper mulches are

156
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,560
the only ones we see here

157
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,199
that would control nutsedge so if you

158
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,879
have nutsedge as a problem in your area

159
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,000
they can puncture right through plastic

160
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,000
mulch so if you have these as a major

161
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,199
kind of contaminant kind of a weed in

162
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,120
the in the field

163
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,800
using the paper mulches can suppress

164
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
them from being able to poke their way

165
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,000
up

166
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,600
and through your mulch now we also have

167
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
economic considerations that's a very

168
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,360
important consideration

169
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,680
uh biodegradable materials do provide

170
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,439
benefits however in all cases

171
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
they were less when compared to

172
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,240
polyethylene traditional plastic

173
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,000
this is why plastic melted still remains

174
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,319
the most commonly used option

175
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,160
despite the disposal issues as well as

176
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,560
some other issues that it has still the

177
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
most widely used option

178
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,879
then we get to manual weeding so many

179
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,279
weeding did result in low weed densities

180
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,079
however depending on the area and labor

181
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,599
this may be

182
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,319
cost prohibitive especially depending on

183
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
the size of your operation

184
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,918
and lastly we're applying these findings

185
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,239
to our cannabis production

186
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,159
so in season plastic offers many

187
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,400
benefits but growers must consider the

188
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,919
entire growing season with the typically

189
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,000
well-established root system

190
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,839
based systems of cannabis this can make

191
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,879
the removal of plastic melted at the end

192
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,198
of the season

193
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,959
much more challenging in addition to the

194
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,120
disposal issues

195
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,719
if the field you're planting cannabis

196
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,879
and it has nutsedge though

197
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
which is sadly becoming a bigger problem

198
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,839
in many agricultural

199
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
fields the more i go into more problems

200
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,038
it seems like there are

201
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,799
growers should consider the use of

202
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,599
potential paper mulch because that is

203
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,520
the only mulch

204
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
is resistant to the emergence of

205
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,359
nutsedge message can emerge through

206
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,680
plastic mulch punches right through

207
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,680
and only paper munch paper mulch has

208
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,639
shown effectiveness at reducing its

209
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,400
emergence

210
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,840
so this is where knowing your field can

211
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,279
be also be important

212
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,359
to know that hey it's a lot of nutsage

213
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,839
in this field maybe i would consider

214
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,479
the use of a paper mulch over a plastic

215
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,159
mulch

216
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,680
but as you can see plastic still

217
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,800
regarded as the number one use because

218
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,240
of its benefits

219
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
but you want to look at this data and

220
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,280
see which one might fit your situation

221
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,280
the best
