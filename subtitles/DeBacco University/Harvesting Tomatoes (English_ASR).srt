1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
so we're looking at harvesting Tomatoes

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:06,419
and hopefully you all have a bountiful

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,660
harvest like this grower is having here

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:11,490
and how we're going to go about how we

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,099
can go about harvesting them and when

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,900
will we go about harvesting them so this

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,000
whole harvest thing comes down to the

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,980
rule number one is that your first

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,109
tomato will always take longer than you

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,980
think but once you get that first one

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,880
the rest come right after it seems like

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,579
so hardly demands well what's your

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,589
market you're looking at CSAs they're

14
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:34,349
looking at farmers markets looking at

15
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,969
chefs demanding them that can determine

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,070
how frequently or how often you go

17
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,300
through and harvest your tomatoes you

18
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,579
want to watch the weather though if it's

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,769
rain in the forecast you may want to

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,140
harvest a day early one to get in the

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,570
field but also to reduce the chance of

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,270
cracking of their Tomatoes very common

23
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,969
with some cherries mixed colors and

24
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,410
varieties can be very attractive when

25
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,448
you put them in a quart so you may want

26
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,788
to harvest not all of one variety when I

27
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:02,549
do a mix sometimes there's you pick

28
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,909
operations for to reduce the labor of

29
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,289
harvesting in particular cherry tomatoes

30
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:09,330
for larger Tomatoes can you sell yellow

31
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,430
tomatoes days do they need to be red do

32
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,109
they want to be striped again that's

33
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,509
gonna depend on what market you're

34
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,700
selling to and on larger Tomatoes well

35
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,259
how big is too big is there a certain

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,820
size people won't buy they don't want to

37
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,890
spend that much on one single tomato

38
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,589
again something to consider for your

39
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,090
individual market something some girls

40
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,159
don't know about when harvesting today

41
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,560
is called the breaker stage this is very

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,840
common late in the season this is the

43
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,240
break in color on the tomato will ripen

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,450
from so when we see that kind of very

45
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,609
hinting kind of pinkish different color

46
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,189
towards the blossom end so it's called a

47
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:46,170
breaker stage you see the speck of pink

48
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,089
at the blossom end this means your

49
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,219
tomatoes reached the breaker stage and

50
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,109
you can harvest it at that time and it

51
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,359
may take a little bit longer than you

52
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:56,938
like but it will eventually ripe into a

53
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,170
red color so important that gets head

54
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:01,228
late in the season when we're dealing

55
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,090
with the frost coming down potentially

56
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:04,379
ruining the rest of your crop and go

57
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,030
through and harvest what's called the

58
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,340
breaker stage and beyond

59
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,500
tomatoes and eventually is stored an

60
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,770
area above freezing they will eventually

61
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,689
turn red so just a little helpful hint

62
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,950
we're going to an harvesting or

63
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,490
determining when the harvest your

64
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:19,489
Tomatoes
