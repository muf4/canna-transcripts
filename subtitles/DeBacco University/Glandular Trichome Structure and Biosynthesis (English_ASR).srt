1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,799
in this debacco University video I'm

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,120
going to go over gland trium structure

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:08,638
and biosynthesis to give you a better

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,000
appreciation for the formation of this

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,000
plant

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,039
[Music]

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,480
structure all right let's get into a

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,080
review of the Articles so there are two

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,880
articles so this is the first one here

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,000
um again some great information provided

11
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,439
in these as well as the citation

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,840
provided here as well as in the

13
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,878
description this is the first one and

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,120
then this is the second one and based on

15
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,479
the slide I'll cite what source it came

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,759
from so first off kind of like this

17
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,479
General summary slide here uh that kind

18
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,960
of gives you an idea of a little bit of

19
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,839
the experimentation as well as the

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,239
progression of plants how long they

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,280
spend in kind of that long day

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,280
vegetative stage compared to the short

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,079
day conditions where they're flowering

24
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,160
also when the researchers recommend

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,920
applying that silver nitrate treatment

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,000
as we look at the development of the

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,960
growth cycle of the plant as well as

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,319
some other uh scientific studies that

29
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,519
they um looked at and did just good for

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,559
timing and good general

31
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:11,319
information now looking at the um

32
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,960
researchers and what they provided you

33
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:14,679
with the kind of the general timelines

34
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,438
there in more of a word form and I

35
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,520
provided you some general pictures here

36
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,239
but cannabis does exhibit a relatively

37
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:22,719
short growth cycle lasting only about 2

38
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,118
to 5 months the seeding stage is defined

39
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,200
for somewhere in that 3 to 10 day range

40
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,719
post germination in the vegetative

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,920
growth stage we're growing the leaves

42
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,920
and the plant structure and the roof

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,240
Roots it's about 20 to 30 days and this

44
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,320
is when the plants Focus really on that

45
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,519
root and choot development rapid growth

46
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,599
of the upper part of the plant is

47
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,118
maintained for 10 to 30 days and then of

48
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,879
course there's the focus on flower and

49
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,879
pre flowers we can see right here are

50
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:49,158
shoots as cuting are suitable for

51
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:51,118
asexual uh propagation the flowering is

52
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,880
initiated in cannabis can be induced by

53
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,718
subjecting the plants to a short day

54
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,718
conditions again not talking about autof

55
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:59,078
flowers but this short day conditions

56
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,000
could induce flowering at any stage or

57
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:02,839
any age you want to be careful and

58
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,599
that's why I show those timelines is

59
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,520
that's when it's most advantageous

60
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,079
because you want a plant that can

61
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,280
actually support uh flowers uh for the

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,239
end result after approximately a week

63
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,479
flowers begin to appear at the top of

64
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,200
branches post switching it to a short

65
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,719
day the flowering phase typically lasts

66
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,839
for about a month now when we're looking

67
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:23,878
at the growth experiment which I

68
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,759
mentioned the um silver nitrate when

69
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:27,598
treating with the hormones or silver

70
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,959
nitrate female plants can be transformed

71
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,439
into male plants which is great for

72
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,439
breeding purposes

73
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,159
the harvesting of inflorescence for

74
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,919
cannabinoids is typically done when the

75
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,280
pistols have withered and some of the

76
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,598
tricomes are in amber color of other

77
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,199
videos going into that in more detail if

78
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:44,399
female flowers are pollinated during the

79
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,039
flowering phase seeds can be collected

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,120
after approximately a month when they

81
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:50,639
should be mature and allowing you to

82
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,519
grow the next phase new varieties with

83
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,399
high CBD yield can be obtained through

84
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,640
carbonization breeding or molecular

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,039
breeding techniques which is great ways

86
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,639
to get new varieties while we're always

87
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:03,639
seeing new things come into the market

88
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,958
place now different types of uh

89
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,839
glandular triom so GT when you see that

90
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,759
abbreviation that's going to stand for

91
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,039
glandular tricomes so just keep that in

92
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,598
mind for that

93
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,878
abbreviation now scanning electron

94
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:18,919
microsopy analysis illustrating the

95
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,878
different uh glandular tricomes Types on

96
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,119
the surface of various tissues in our

97
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,639
cannabis ativa so we see type one type

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,799
two type three and type four and we can

99
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,919
see them defined right here where type

100
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,680
one is that capit struck stocked glander

101
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:36,598
triome type three is the capid cile

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,920
gland triome three is the bulbus and

103
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:41,000
four is the nonsecretory there now we

104
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,798
can see in the flowering uh Primary

105
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,519
tricomes in this area of the plant

106
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,159
you're going to find uh potentially all

107
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,438
five definitely as you get later into

108
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,719
harvest the BRS here are also going to

109
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:52,598
find a five in that top portion on the

110
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,199
stem you find primarily just the type

111
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:56,719
four which don't secrete any

112
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,598
cannabinoids and the leaf also primary

113
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,560
type four so again just because you're

114
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:01,959
finding tricomes don't mean that there

115
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,840
are the triom that contain the

116
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,079
cannaboids and tpin many Growers are

117
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,719
seeking so regory Network I don't want

118
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,040
to get too much into the detail of this

119
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,519
but this is a summarized transcriptional

120
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,959
regulatory Network and what I want you

121
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,680
to take away from this is the

122
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,478
complexities of this now this isn't done

123
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,358
actually on cannabis it's done actually

124
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,639
on tomato and sweet wormwood which also

125
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,599
have tricomes which are analogous or

126
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,079
similar uh to cannabis we need to see

127
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,879
some more of that cannabis specific

128
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,719
research but this is providing our

129
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,918
starting point because we need a

130
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,080
starting point cuz it's so complex now

131
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,439
where we see the arrows those indicate

132
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,279
an uppr regulation and where we see the

133
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:41,199
kind of ended kind of blunt lines there

134
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,719
uh that indicates a down regulation or

135
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,199
inhibition so certain things certain uh

136
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,600
components can upregulate things and

137
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,800
certain things can downregulate or

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,199
suppress things and how these are

139
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,319
interacting which is really important to

140
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,199
better understand the full development

141
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,879
of these tricomes in the cannaboids and

142
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,319
Turpin that they

143
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,639
contain so looking a little more at the

144
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,079
details here of the biosynthesis going

145
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,360
to break these apart into a little more

146
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,918
detail um we can see the basic structure

147
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,479
which you're hopefully visually uh used

148
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,079
to looking at but then we're going to go

149
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:12,918
into a little bit of that kind of that

150
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:15,000
zoomed in here so just what's occurring

151
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,120
in this region be is a zoom in version

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,879
of that and just what's occurring in

153
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,000
this region to zoom in of that so you

154
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,600
can see again how you want to look at it

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,560
macroscopically as well as potentially

156
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,919
microscopically and this is another uh

157
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,319
schematic model here showing the struct

158
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,399
trium development again different

159
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,800
research Pi showing how it formations on

160
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,198
that epidermal area there and kind of

161
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,879
kind of forms a little bit of a bulb and

162
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,240
then kind of forms that stocked region

163
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,079
eventually and again zoomed in versions

164
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,759
of different regions there great

165
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,680
diagrams to pause the video take a look

166
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,400
at or go back to the original

167
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,439
study now structural diagram here of

168
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,758
those that are secreting uh those

169
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,600
cannabis GL tricomes are distinctive

170
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,120
secretory secretory structures that are

171
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,120
critical in the production and

172
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,038
reservation of uh cannabinoids primarily

173
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,038
found in the brain Rax flowers of female

174
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,199
cannabis plants they said those founds

175
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,800
on the leaves those founds on the main

176
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,560
stems They Don't Really secrete anything

177
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,680
now mature granular triom showing the

178
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,560
extracellular storage cavity and

179
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,160
secretory cells on the large

180
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,319
multicellular stock now following grul

181
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,439
triome inhibition poal cells

182
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,560
differentiating into secretary absis and

183
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,560
stock cells so what we're having here is

184
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,598
this development these specialized

185
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,120
structures as we're developing this

186
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:31,439
stocked region on there it's basically

187
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,280
causing the droplet to form on the top

188
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,759
or the cavity to form on top where all

189
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,318
those droplets are going to be added to

190
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,960
that's where it's going to swell up and

191
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,280
that's where a lot of those storage

192
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:42,239
areas are going to be kept distinctly

193
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,478
and physically away from the leaf and

194
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,560
plant

195
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:46,680
surface now again this is what they look

196
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,439
like kind of if you're looking at used

197
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,439
to looking at through a magnifying Loop

198
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,719
uh they are known as the plant chemical

199
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,160
factories these areas here uh where

200
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,039
they're secreting synthesizing

201
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,960
accumulating and storing multiple

202
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,159
secondary metabolites for example

203
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,598
cannaboid

204
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,400
these structures are primarly found on

205
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,279
the bra and flowers of female canvas

206
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:08,758
plants and here we can see them in high

207
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:12,679
density now the isolation analysis of

208
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,439
Canam glander tricomes cbga and thca are

209
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,759
produced in both bulbless glander

210
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,319
tricomes and stocked ones as well and

211
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,759
you can see here's the bulbous ones very

212
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,479
very small and then the um stocked ones

213
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,879
that you're probably more familiar with

214
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,639
CBC and CBN were specifically detected

215
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,800
in bulbous um stocked tricomes so again

216
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,400
these are the ones here and stocked

217
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,120
tricomes have higher accumulations of

218
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:36,399
monot Turpin and this is based on auto

219
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,319
fluoresence studies that were conducted

220
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,359
there and just as reminder it's thca and

221
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,240
cbga because that's the plant form um

222
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,038
and then that's kind of the acid form

223
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,478
that then needs to be DEC carboxilate to

224
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:49,199
make the active form for The receptors

225
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,318
in

226
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,400
humans now canab synthesis uh the

227
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,199
synthesis have greater metabolic

228
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,719
efficiencies in hydrophobic environments

229
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,759
compared to aquous ones so lipid based

230
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,560
fat-based environments are going to be

231
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,038
the ones that are more favorable the

232
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,560
metabolite polysaccharide wall bound may

233
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:11,399
be a favorable micro environment that is

234
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,598
well suited for th biosynthesis and this

235
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,878
could explain the Abundant synthesis and

236
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,079
secretion of canano in these glandular

237
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,599
tricomes however the ability of these

238
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,839
glandular tricomes which again are small

239
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,639
in physical size to produce and secrete

240
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,439
these significant quantities of

241
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,598
secondary metabolites Still Remains a

242
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,120
mystery so there's a lot that still

243
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:33,838
needs to be studied let the Sy be better

244
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,120
understood about these specific Pathways

245
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,399
of how these plants go about producing

246
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,918
these now the stock gler triome

247
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,879
development then development trajectory

248
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,958
of stock gler tricomes from the pral

249
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,879
initiation which is on the left here to

250
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,399
the cesil like intermediate with a small

251
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,720
metabolite droplet to the mature

252
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,639
overmature tricomes all the way on the

253
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,120
right so we know a little bit about the

254
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,639
formation of the physical structure um

255
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,560
of these and how they go about those

256
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,480
distinctive stages but understanding

257
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,399
more about the um intercellular and the

258
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,200
gene regulation um is definitely

259
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,919
needed now that triome development again

260
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,160
the first step of that Trion development

261
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,479
is a different differentiation of those

262
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,199
cells trigger a series of cell divisions

263
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,039
resulting in that epidermal outgrowth

264
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,680
that stocked formation that physical

265
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:22,480
stocked towerer like look the exact

266
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:25,000
regulatory mechanisms that trigger the

267
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,600
development of these cells in cannabis

268
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,519
at least is still unknown so again we

269
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,759
know what kind of what happens just

270
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
don't know what triggers it what

271
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,919
initiate um that other species as I said

272
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,839
like tomato and sweet wormwood are

273
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:39,278
providing useful comparisons but we need

274
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,360
to research cannabis a little bit

275
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:44,799
further now the can interpreting

276
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,000
biosynthesis here so secretory cells

277
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:51,078
form this inter interconnected [ __ ] uh

278
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,078
responsible for canabo and turpine

279
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:57,120
biosynthesis transport and storage this

280
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:59,000
sinum is a single cell or cytoplasmic

281
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,000
mass containing several nuclei formed by

282
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,278
Fusion of cells or by division of the

283
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,039
nuclei and the formation of this storage

284
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,879
cavity will occur through the de

285
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,759
elimination of the cell wall so here we

286
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,519
can see again this zoomed in portion

287
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,039
kind of what's occurring right here

288
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,959
we've got all these important organel

289
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,799
within the cell we're looking at these

290
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,000
particular regions um here or where this

291
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,879
is occurring giving us an idea where to

292
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,278
start focusing some of the

293
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,399
research now distribution of the

294
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,799
plastids here so when we're looking at

295
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,440
the distribution of PL plaids in the

296
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:35,319
secretory stage of these glander Tricom

297
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,399
Placid move between cells via apertures

298
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,360
in the glander triome cell wall and

299
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,919
those are located right here so like

300
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,720
little spaces or gaps if you will um and

301
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,278
this is right below the cell wall and

302
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,040
leading into that storage cavity so

303
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,879
again we're taking this very zoomed in

304
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,039
kind of approach here but we're looking

305
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:57,078
at understanding at least initially

306
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:59,399
where some of these uh distributions are

307
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:02,000
occurring now the formation of the canab

308
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,039
oids uh this is where cbga likely

309
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,759
partitions into the plasmid membrane

310
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:10,319
Bayer and canid biosynthesis occurs at

311
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:14,519
the dis cell wall where thca synthesis

312
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,320
or cbda synthesis catalyzes cbga to

313
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,879
produce thca or cbga respectively so

314
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,519
keep in mind that that uh CBG is that

315
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:26,480
precursor molecule that then is made by

316
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:28,759
the plant's Direction into THC or CBD um

317
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,399
so again it gets very complex here just

318
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,879
trying to give a general overview and

319
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,879
hopefully just an appreciation for

320
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,919
what's occurring uh even though we tend

321
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,799
to only look at those end products can

322
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,479
it's form the lipophilic metabolite

323
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,559
droplets within the apical cell wall

324
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,959
creating a storage cavity in space and

325
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,039
ultimately that's where it's going and

326
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,319
that's where we start to look at our

327
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,240
tricomes going from that clear to cloudy

328
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,399
to potentially Amber

329
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,399
colorations now distribution oh

330
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,959
sorry now the cannabinoid bioin pathway

331
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,759
here again looking at a little bit more

332
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:06,078
detail from the other researchers

333
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,600
provided those metabolites interact with

334
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,199
the specialized cell wall components to

335
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,079
form small metabolite droplets that

336
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,560
basically coales into a large Central

337
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,679
droplet and mature in the triome the

338
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,198
high resolution electronic mycra

339
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:22,559
demonstrates that these canid secory dis

340
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:25,399
nonphotosynthetic uh plastids which are

341
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,719
producing all these GPS PS contain

342
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,440
unusual crystall likee lattice structure

343
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,399
at the core what does that look like

344
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,639
that's basically this kind of physical

345
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,919
structure which looks like basically a

346
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:40,360
pattern you might see on a weave pattern

347
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:42,120
of for example of a fabric the immunog

348
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,240
globe tem transmission electron

349
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,799
microscope using antibody specific thcas

350
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,240
localized thcas on the surface of cell

351
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:51,240
walls so now we kind of know where to

352
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,680
look at those surface of the cell walls

353
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,839
of those secretory disc cells underlying

354
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,198
the storage cavity but are not the anti-

355
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,000
clinical or basil cell walls so we're

356
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:04,198
developing this understanding to kind of

357
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,240
have this delimination Zone this area of

358
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:07,958
where things might be occurring or at

359
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,879
least eliminating some areas where

360
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,278
they're probably not occurring and the

361
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,078
formation of these extracellular

362
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,519
cavities occurs by the delimination and

363
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,519
separation of those dis cells walls

364
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,720
resulting in the wall layer that remains

365
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,759
continuous with the plasma membrane

366
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,320
which is the surface of the cell wall

367
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,639
and a secondary a second that remains

368
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,519
continuous with the with the cuticle sub

369
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,799
cuticle layer so we're looking at these

370
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,480
different layers lers when we're looking

371
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:34,159
at the building of these structures

372
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,600
we're having these layers the cell is

373
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,039
starting to develop these separate

374
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,839
Pockets or the separate categories um

375
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,439
there allowing those certain compounds

376
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,839
to accumulate in different areas so it's

377
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,560
these very specifically directed

378
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,519
specialization areas that those genes

379
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:51,239
that are being activated to start to

380
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,399
cause these separated in distinctive

381
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,000
regions are important to develop in

382
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,039
understanding for now extracellular

383
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,399
storage again to some cool macroscopic

384
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,198
pictures here canab turpine products are

385
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,039
warehoused in the extrasellar storage

386
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,799
cavity these compounds are stored

387
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,000
essentially outside and away from the

388
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,479
plant important kind of key step here

389
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,720
hope you tuned in this long where these

390
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,120
compounds are very physically separated

391
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,519
from the plant uh physically in a

392
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,399
different location yes made by the plant

393
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,440
but stored kind of as far away from the

394
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,639
plant as possible uh which is an

395
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,519
interesting kind of plant evolutionary

396
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,159
aspect of why is it developing these

397
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,480
compounds and why are they kept so far

398
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,480
away from the plant final multicellular

399
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,120
stocks rise to GL or triom heads above

400
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,159
the epidermis giving the canas flower

401
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,159
their Frosty appearance so while this is

402
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,439
a really zoomed in look to it um that's

403
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:42,719
what's a bunch of these kind of this

404
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,120
high density is causing that Frosty look

405
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,160
to them they go from that clear kind of

406
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,159
that milky white kind of

407
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:52,360
appearance now lastly stoms mature the

408
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,198
microsopy did show that once stoms have

409
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,519
reached maturity turning in amberik

410
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:58,039
color we can see here resin droplets are

411
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,360
secreted on the surface of the gland

412
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:02,240
your head and the cuticle collapses

413
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,959
inward so this is the point at which

414
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,519
we're looking at Peak maturity of those

415
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,000
tricomes of those kind of secretory

416
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,759
compounds uh put there so I no this was

417
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,399
a little bit of a detailed look the uh

418
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,639
research article is going into more

419
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,240
detail but gives you an appreciation for

420
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,639
that color change or those structures

421
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,639
you might be looking at and hopefully

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,600
looking at in great detail what the

423
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,919
plant's actually doing and also a little

424
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,519
maybe a little shocking to try to

425
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,559
understand the research that still needs

426
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,198
to continually be done to better

427
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,198
understand this process
