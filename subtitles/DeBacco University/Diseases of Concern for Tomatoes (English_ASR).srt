1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
okay here we're going to look at some

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,640
diseases of concern for tomatoes elicit

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,740
kind of the major ones to be on the

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,839
lookout for here provide with a couple

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,789
pictures and if you can't identify these

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,189
pictures you'll see them a later in the

7
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:15,838
presentation well starting with our

8
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:18,000
diseases we won't look at initially how

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,649
to control them well there's the organic

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,809
standards and then there's a chemical

11
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,939
options for the organic standards

12
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,528
typically the use of copper should be

13
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,719
limited even though it is Omri certified

14
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:29,910
because it doesn't contain carbon and

15
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,799
can persist in the soil but is a good

16
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,280
option to have on hand in addition to

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,620
oxidate regalia in grande evo for

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,390
chemical set options it's not to say the

19
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,729
worst of all the options if it's used

20
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,890
with the careful IPM program integrated

21
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,599
pest management practices staple

22
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,530
chemical products would be something

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,890
like a Bravo

24
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,079
which is a cloth I know Manzi and topper

25
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,079
in the form of cosine 3000 which is not

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,140
army certified it has shown some

27
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,820
effectiveness now looking at the

28
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,859
specific diseases well one is powdery

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,929
mildew so what to look for is white

30
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,129
fluffy spots in the leaves and when

31
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:07,500
you're inspecting your plants well it

32
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,909
for shaded areas under leaves where

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,280
there's not a lot of sunlight

34
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,290
penetration and also high humidity and

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,780
moisture content how to prevent this

36
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,390
while spacing your plants out about to

37
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,099
reduce the leaf wetness and pruning can

38
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,978
also help with this throughout the

39
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,140
season how to control organically 40%

40
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:27,269
milk and 60% water can be effective as

41
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,540
well as oxidate which doesn't last very

42
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:33,359
long is an option in magelia chemically

43
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,360
rally 40 worked pretty good last year

44
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,489
and Bravo

45
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,140
Alton area or early blight will look

46
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,328
like this it's small black specks

47
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,759
located on lower leaves lesions and

48
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:46,169
everines like a tree so you kind of see

49
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,109
here we have this distinctive kind of

50
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,390
rings that's a key part for identifying

51
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,828
it to have early blight how to prevent

52
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,890
this will limit soil splash onto the

53
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:57,599
leaves and ensure good light penetration

54
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,210
oxidate or copper for organic Bravo

55
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:04,228
Manzi or copper for chemical control

56
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:05,578
options late plate so this one gets a

57
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:07,228
lot of attention I get a lot of girls

58
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,359
that think they have sleep lights so pay

59
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,310
attention to the specific images and

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,860
some of the key concepts here for late

61
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,319
blight lesions usually start

62
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,510
on both the leaves but can progress to

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,549
fruit in stem so typically people will

64
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:23,209
see them on the leaves first but it can

65
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,770
progress to the fruit and also the stems

66
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,960
typically occurs as large spots and not

67
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,060
small pinpoints see here a large portion

68
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,849
of the Leafs infected common during heat

69
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,409
waves and later in the season how to

70
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,000
really prevent this well resistant

71
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:37,889
varieties is a good first step

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,780
typically those seeds will cost more but

73
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,479
it's worth it if late blight does come

74
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,960
in and later in the year organically

75
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,759
copper and oxidate can be used oxidate

76
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,010
snot great coppers pretty much the only

77
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,189
option chemically if you can use mint

78
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:55,079
kazab that has been shown effective some

79
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:56,579
key images or classic symptoms I should

80
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,170
say for late blight would be the entire

81
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,320
leaf you see here looks perfectly fine

82
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:02,609
there's just one large lesion here but

83
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,739
see I have some other leaves it's also

84
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,510
on the stems also looking here at the

85
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,060
tomato this is a large area here that

86
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:10,739
it's infected I provided a link down at

87
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,300
the bottom if you want to look at some

88
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,540
more information about late blight in

89
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,030
particular bacterial spec so these are

90
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,939
very small dark specks that are circular

91
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,129
these small little dots they can be seen

92
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,560
both on the leaves and also on the fruit

93
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:28,199
you want to avoid soil splash and

94
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,449
because this is a bacterial fungicides

95
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:33,209
won't work very well so applying a

96
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,919
copper would be advised you could see it

97
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,110
kind of be consistent none of us is a

98
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,549
farm that I visited you could see how

99
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,230
it's very consistent in the lower leaves

100
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,360
and when you zoom in you see these small

101
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:45,299
little specks this would be bacterial

102
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,040
spec for distilling millet another one

103
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,719
affects the lower leaves they'll click

104
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,969
they're kind of burning there's a very

105
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,680
similar look to like a few cerium the

106
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:54,959
key part here is to rotate crops and

107
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,459
panel resistant varieties because

108
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,740
there's really not much you can do for

109
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,670
verticillium once you get it in season

110
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:05,490
because it is a systemic disease lastly

111
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:07,500
here is leaf mold it's a fuzzy kind of

112
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,180
top and bottom to the leaves but

113
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,530
especially look at the underside of the

114
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,270
lower leaf surface because you'll have

115
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,919
these kind of lesions that appear here

116
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,700
you're just looking from the top you'll

117
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,649
see kind of what looks like the

118
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,500
yellowing flip that leaf over and you'll

119
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:22,349
see actual the leaf mold there it's very

120
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,850
common in high tunnels in fields where

121
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,070
there's a lot of moisture a lot of

122
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,600
hanging fog early in the morning we want

123
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,129
to inspect transplants before they go

124
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,110
to the field if they are started in the

125
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:32,370
greenhouse or high tunnel maybe make an

126
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,470
application in there if you see it

127
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,689
before they go out to this field have

128
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,190
good air circulation and avoid feeding

129
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:40,829
plants with a lot of nitrogen can help

130
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:42,360
reduce this problem oxidate and Bravo

131
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:46,039
would be two methods that you could

132
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,040
apply to help control this disease
