1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,139
okay for watching this video you're

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,309
watching for one of two reasons first

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:07,648
could be a stumbled upon this video

4
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:10,289
first or two you came across my other

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,300
fourth line method video and wanted a

6
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:13,798
little bit of an easier version this is

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,740
gonna explain the same method and go

8
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,689
through the very similar process so you

9
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,459
can gain some experience with it want

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,778
you to be comfortable with the fork line

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,570
method to get away from the punnett

12
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:28,109
squares this is a more reliable method

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,359
and it's easier and quicker so we're

14
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,759
going to try habit cross using the fork

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,309
line method now this same can be applied

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,840
to more or less complex equations the

17
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:39,299
key part is you need to understand what

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,340
a monohybrid crosses and also the foil

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,409
method from math class look at the first

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,850
outer and inner last to distribute

21
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:49,529
things in that use a Punnett square

22
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:53,460
problem is a politic plant and the

23
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,129
genotype big a big a big B Big B Big C

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,439
little C is crossed with another plant

25
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:01,439
of genotype which is homozygous dominant

26
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,808
for a heterozygous for be in

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,579
heterozygous for see what are the

28
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,019
expected genotype frequencies of the

29
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,269
offspring or seeds produced from this

30
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:12,179
resulting cross now since both parents

31
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,859
are homozygous down for the a allele the

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,750
process shown isn't quite as efficient

33
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,040
as it could be but this isn't in it to

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,750
though to help those that might be

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,490
struggling to understand this method

36
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,188
odds are you probably haven't seen this

37
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,750
in middle school or anywhere else this

38
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:25,438
might be your first exposure to that and

39
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,909
that's okay

40
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,949
I want you to be sure that you can

41
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,150
understand it if you were to do a

42
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,820
Punnett square it looks something like

43
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,380
this which is gets very complex and very

44
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,750
hard to keep track of things and

45
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,179
increases the odds for an error we want

46
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,799
to try to avoid that this fork line

47
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,320
method is a lot cleaner and a lot easier

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,810
to understand once you get over the

49
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,099
initial hurdle of seeing that something

50
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,950
different in the punnett squares you

51
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,390
might be used to so step one identifying

52
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,030
the triad would cross into three

53
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,710
monohybrid crosses one for the a alleles

54
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,049
one for the B alleles one for the seal

55
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,368
is never use the foil method and not

56
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,560
punnett squares and generate this

57
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:05,640
looking at plants or looking at

58
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,170
generating the genotype for seeds so

59
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,520
same with the first one because both

60
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,390
parents in this case are almost I guess

61
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,280
dominant

62
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:16,199
100% of the time that's going to be the

63
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,090
resulting of the offspring they're

64
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,159
called true breeding in that sense for

65
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,590
that allele least for the because we

66
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,340
have a homozygous dominant heterozygous

67
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,439
half the time

68
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,120
we'll have Big B Big B and the other

69
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,129
half the time will be heterozygous Big B

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,659
little B see it's a little more bit more

71
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,329
complex here what both being

72
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,430
heterozygous 1/4 of be homozygous

73
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,160
dominant the other quarter will be

74
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,560
almost I guess recessive and half the

75
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,299
time that will be heterozygous so how do

76
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,939
we put all these genotype frequencies

77
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,980
together well first off we have to

78
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,229
identify the possible combinations of

79
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,729
genotypes this requires the pairing of

80
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:52,799
genotypes from all the monohybrid

81
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,179
crosses previously completed you're

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,430
talking about plants will get pollen

83
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,400
grains so hundred percent in time it's

84
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,040
always gonna give a homozygous dominant

85
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,439
for a half will be homozygous dominant

86
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,689
for B half will be heterozygous for B

87
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,840
and then for C remember a quarter of the

88
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,430
time it'll be homozygous dominant

89
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,280
quarter time homozygous recessive and

90
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,689
half the time heterozygous so start the

91
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,610
fork line method well since one hundred

92
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,449
percent in time the big a big I you just

93
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,940
write that one down

94
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:23,488
now we want to distribute that to our

95
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,530
Belial we know that half the time it'll

96
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,989
be homozygous dominant for me the other

97
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,909
half heterozygous now II to get a little

98
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,120
bit more complex with the C alleles and

99
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,859
we notice that here we're including all

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,409
three of those possibilities for all

101
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,860
three of the options now to get to the

102
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:42,959
seed genotype we simply multiply these

103
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,600
percentages or these fractions right

104
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,390
across notice by doing that it's easy

105
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,870
because the first ones will always 1 1

106
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:55,349
times 1/2 times 1/4 would be in eighth

107
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:58,469
one times 1/2 times 1/2 would be 1/4 1

108
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,569
times 1/2 times 1/4 can will be in E not

109
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:03,689
only are we carrying those numbers my

110
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:06,209
color coded those accordingly

111
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:08,849
we're also carrying around those alleles

112
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,640
so you could see that one is that big a

113
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:13,680
big a indicated here the 1/2 is that

114
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,589
almost I guess down it from B and the

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,358
core is the homozygous dominant for C so

116
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,389
this is how we develop our seed

117
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,409
genotypes with this fork line method and

118
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:24,269
you can see once you get comfortable

119
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,830
with this how quick and easy can

120
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:28,068
actually be into

121
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:31,050
a lot more reliable than upon its square

122
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:32,759
so the simplified version here we take

123
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,538
these fractions and turn them into

124
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,189
percents 1/8 times 100 to give you 12

125
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:41,639
and a half percent and you do that for

126
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:43,259
the rest here now getting back to the

127
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,060
questions what are the expected genotype

128
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,669
frequencies of the offspring or seeds

129
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,918
produced well that would be indicated

130
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:52,158
right here you notice you have all of

131
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,560
these percentages with these genotypes

132
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:57,509
perfectly aligned and all set to go if

133
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,250
you were to add these up you would also

134
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,500
get a hundred percent which is a way to

135
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,610
check to make sure you calculated or

136
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,839
accounted for all the stated genotypes

137
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,699
now if you want to test your skills you

138
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,218
can go my other fork line method example

139
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,468
we look at this cross I'll be sure to

140
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:15,538
put a link in the descriptions you can

141
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:19,079
look at this the key difference here is

142
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:20,399
the a alleles one parent is heterozygous

143
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,068
the other one is almost I guess

144
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,839
recessive you can see how that changes

145
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,090
things you know what else you better

146
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,598
understand get more comfortable at this

147
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:29,598
worked mine
