1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,359
so here on tobacco university i'll be

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,210
describing using liquid carbon dioxide

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,379
for cannabis production

4
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:10,379
[Music]

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,600
interested in using a very dense uh

6
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,399
very pure form of carbon dioxide well

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,080
using liquid

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,759
might be worth a consideration

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,198
particularly if you're a larger growing

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,199
operation

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,599
so liquid carbon dioxide is similar to

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,200
compressed carbon dioxide at least

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,119
in the general methods that would be

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,880
implemented liquid bottles are

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,280
essentially a denser form

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,359
of compressed carbon dioxide however

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,399
unlike compressed carbon dioxide

18
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,719
liquid carbon dioxide requires

19
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,960
refrigeration

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,719
when being stored and typically it's

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,840
found in larger sizes

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,399
here we see a 300 pound 500 pound at 750

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,879
pound

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,079
they even come in larger sizes than that

25
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,479
for your liquid

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,000
carbon dioxide now as i said this does

27
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,000
require specialized equipment

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
so there is more required equipment when

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,359
using liquid carbon dioxide and this is

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,840
why it is commonly used

31
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,118
for larger applications where compressed

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,200
carbon dioxide tank

33
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,879
would simply be too large and require

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,200
two frequent fillings

35
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,959
so using liquid as we can see here this

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,118
is probably your regular

37
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,039
for size comparison 50 pound bottles and

38
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,438
see how large this liquid carbon

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,200
dioxide tank is so specialized

40
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:28,478
equipments but can be justified

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,079
for larger growing operations now liquid

42
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,840
becomes a gas so if you're using liquid

43
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:32,639
carbon dioxide it will not be delivered

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,799
to the plants

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
as a liquid but it will be delivered as

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,920
a gas

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,439
so it will be heated and injected via

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
the gaseous state

49
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,679
now that does not mean you can go

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,520
through and go through and add a fire

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,920
extinguisher and you know add

52
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,519
the gaseous state in this way now here's

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
using the fan help disperse it

54
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,239
not really recommended in that way be

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,560
much more precisely delivered to plants

56
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,280
and allows for very consistent results

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,359
so

58
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,718
same general idea but in the very

59
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,519
general sense but not

60
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,239
like this so liquid carbon dioxide set

61
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,078
up what was that

62
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,679
what would that actually look like well

63
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,519
here we see there's a safety relief

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
valve we have a pressure gauge

65
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
a darker colored ring around the top of

66
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,760
the cylinder indicates a siphon tube is

67
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
present

68
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,679
so when we're looking at the actual kind

69
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,120
of cylinder i'm noticing there is a

70
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,439
gaseous carbon dioxide

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
that's about five to ten percent of

72
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,280
carbon dioxide by weight is

73
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
unused because only gas remains and we

74
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,039
have the liquid carbon dioxide here at

75
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,399
700 to 800 pounds per square inch

76
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,159
if you're looking at this in general

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,280
very similar to a gas estate a

78
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,439
compressed bottle

79
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,400
but as we saw here additional equipment

80
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,000
is required

81
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,239
and tends to be used in larger sizes for

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,598
for larger operations where simple

83
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,000
compressed bottles

84
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,799
would just be too laborious and not as

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
efficient
