1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,950
okay here we're a very important protein

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,169
structure called hemoglobin it's

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,780
involved in our red blood cells and is

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:11,669
vital to keep us alive to allow oxygen

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:14,369
the carbon tax hit to be exchanged

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,019
within our body so hemoglobin first

7
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,329
oxygen moves within the circulatory

8
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:20,550
system piggyback then the protein called

9
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,948
hemoglobin because it's a protein in

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,539
shape is very important hemoglobin

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,368
contains iron which combined with oxygen

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,260
in a reversible way it's a good thing

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,109
it's reversible we want oxygen to bind

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,759
and also be released from that we also

15
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,859
want even the open to transport our

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,020
carbon dioxide this gives you an idea of

17
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,149
the chemical structure F sees that iron

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,629
located in the center and actually if

19
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,820
you compare this to chloroplasts in

20
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,549
plants it actually is a very similar

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,399
structure with magnesium being in the

22
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:53,009
center so hemoglobin each hemoglobin

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,929
molecule can carry four oxygen atoms the

24
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,570
presence of oxygen turns hemoglobin a

25
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,280
bright red if it's not down to the

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,590
oxygen those would be a shade of red but

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,320
not quite that bright vibrant red they

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,969
see the binding here of our oxygen

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,769
molecules seeing one down to see the

30
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,319
options for to being down for 3 being

31
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:13,140
bound and then for 4c that same image

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,599
kind of pictured here at T State and our

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,790
state TV stands for 10 state R stands

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,250
for a relaxed state so if kind of that

35
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,939
relaxed state that fully for oxygen

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,680
molecules being bound to that hemoglobin

37
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,649
keep in mind each red blood cell has

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,720
multiple and many many hemoglobin

39
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,030
molecules so that's allowing it to bind

40
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,810
a lots of oxygen and transport that to

41
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,070
cells that are actively respiring

42
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,780
continuing on when oxygen binds it

43
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,389
causes a conformational change in the

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,609
proteins so we can see here is our

45
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,799
change deoxygenated versus our

46
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:49,469
oxygenated you can see there's a change

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,079
in shape here non-planar versus planar

48
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,390
because this is a protein again shape is

49
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,209
very important an additional can impact

50
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,368
proteins well he is one also pH is

51
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,408
another factor that can affect that we

52
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:05,700
see here a decrease in pH causes greater

53
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,229
release of oxygen from hemoglobin so pH

54
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,330
of seven point four to seven point two

55
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:12,479
you can see that shift that nose will

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,620
shift in the effect of the saturation of

57
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,139
the

58
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,450
this is why our blood is kept in a very

59
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:22,579
tight pH range as we want the protein

60
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:22,579
hemoglobin to be able function properly

61
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:26,669
something in the news did you hear quite

62
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,590
a bit is carbon monoxides I want to make

63
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:30,208
sure I mentioned that carbon monoxide

64
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,580
binds tighter to hemoglobin than oxygen

65
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,299
not allowing for these gases to be

66
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,830
carried

67
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:37,830
so what's occurring let's look at this

68
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:41,120
here we're looking at our oxygen bound

69
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:44,599
to hemoglobin and here's our pressure of

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,879
oxygen we're noticing under normal

71
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:51,988
hemoglobin with no carbon monoxide down

72
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:54,810
we can bind this much of our oxidant no

73
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,920
I high amount as we start increasing our

74
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,819
carbon monoxide

75
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,679
here's 20% carbon monoxide 40% 60% we

76
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,289
see this plateau occurring very early

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,780
now allowing us to carry potentially

78
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:08,818
enough oxygen which could either allow

79
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,060
us in a good case to pass out or

80
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:14,128
potentially die anemia and that normal

81
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,989
hemoglobin we had this severe anemia

82
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:18,449
this is another way to kind of

83
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,069
graphically represent that so our blood

84
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,169
our blood in our body system may need

85
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:24,119
this about this much oxygen you can see

86
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,828
how carbon dioxide can negatively impact

87
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,629
that what it does is it's kind of

88
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,090
clogging up the binding sites not

89
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:32,159
allowing oxygen to give it anywhere to

90
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,019
bind to and be carried by the red blood

91
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,609
cell kind of found this a little

92
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,459
humorous there where we have hemoglobin

93
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:42,180
with oxygen and it tends to bind higher

94
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,419
to carbon monoxide and as a result it'll

95
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,370
kick out oxygen so we kind of see that

96
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:49,469
represent a funny way here but there is

97
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,209
some supporting science and if the

98
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,989
graphs don't help you remember it maybe

99
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,269
this will lastly cover the oxide

100
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,680
poisoning I feel I should mention

101
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,450
symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning are

102
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,340
basically symptoms of low oxygen

103
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,578
however carbon dioxide is tasteless

104
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,769
odorless gas that we can't detect

105
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,689
dizziness headaches

106
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:12,629
impairment of brain function

107
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:15,150
ultimately you know could be a coma and

108
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,680
muscle weakness cramps nausea all these

109
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,629
are examples of carbon monoxide

110
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,639
poisoning extremely deadly poisonous gas

111
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:25,348
just for comparison carbon dioxide which

112
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,419
is in your body right now that's okay

113
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:30,029
it's an amount of the person

114
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,280
that you may have so one three five or

115
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:34,409
eight percent a percents extremely high

116
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,989
and it can cause unconsciousness and

117
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,790
tremors one percent just could be

118
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,490
drowsiness three percent because we

119
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,600
reduced hearing increased heart rate and

120
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,100
blood pressure your Bloods trying to

121
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,310
move and get rid of some of that carbon

122
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,170
dioxide five percent to be shortness of

123
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,300
breath dizziness confusion headache and

124
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,860
eight percent serious case even didn't

125
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,780
sight so keep in mind there's a

126
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,960
difference between carbon dioxide and

127
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:00,209
carbon monoxide with dioxin being a lot

128
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,639
easier to have or a lot easier to

129
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:06,620
recover from then lot outside this finds

130
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,620
very tight to human globin molecules
