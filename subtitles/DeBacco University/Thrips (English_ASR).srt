1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,919
see thrips are another major problem for

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:07,169
growers in general this is kind of some

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,000
of the damage they can leave behind this

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:10,138
kind of stippling to the leaves here

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
it's like someone took a little rough

6
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:15,268
sandpaper and you're gonna scratch the

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,309
leaf surface is common thrip damage and

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,769
it's a pretty severe case pictured here

9
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,599
now I want to identifying thrips their

10
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,028
tiny slender insects and they tend to

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,849
jump since they're poor fliers and see

12
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:29,579
how a couple here very small very thin

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,379
kind of this tannish kind of yellowish

14
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:34,320
coloration almost see-through to some

15
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:36,539
extent and they don't travel very far

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,429
because they can't really fly that well

17
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,619
but they can kind of jump around if

18
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:44,159
disturbed they typically like to be

19
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,359
found in places that are low light now

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,738
we're to look for them when I check the

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,929
undersides of the leaves because they do

22
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,419
like that low light or within the

23
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:53,100
protection of flowers plants within the

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,350
stations we evident by the presence of

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,170
tiny black specks which are the feces of

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,760
the actual threats we're going through

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,189
inspecting them you do want to get close

28
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,588
and look this person kind of shooting

29
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:07,500
from the Sun this is an onion field but

30
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:10,530
looking deep down in an area where the

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,879
light is kind of minimal that stippling

32
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,769
we can see a zoomed in version of it

33
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,798
here and this is kind of how it looks a

34
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,539
little bit on the more macro scale now

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,549
how to prevent them and this is kind of

36
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,200
a zoomed in version and this is again

37
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,509
how small they look in relation to the

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,790
leaf when it inspect incoming plants or

39
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,430
cuttings when isolate throat infected

40
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,170
plants if they are identified because

41
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,450
they can easily kind of be cross

42
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,140
contaminating other plants you may have

43
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,609
nearby well we keep weed free barrier of

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,400
at least 10 feet around the greenhouse

45
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:44,219
we help discourage drips entry having

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,079
that 10 foot buffer kind of reduces the

47
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,849
chance that you're going to have a high

48
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,069
population very close to the greenhouse

49
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:51,989
would be very easy for them to come in

50
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:53,908
and infect your plants they also wanna

51
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:55,859
dispose of plant debris in tightly

52
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,750
sealed containers if you do identify

53
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,069
them I'd want to be just throwing them

54
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,718
away in open containers because they

55
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,688
could breed in there and get picked up

56
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,419
by fence or other carriers to get into

57
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:08,549
the facility how to control them will

58
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,679
due to resistance of many insecticides

59
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,550
more growers using biological controls

60
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,439
earth reps

61
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,740
there's commercially available natural

62
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,719
and

63
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,250
including predatory mites beetles and

64
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:22,560
insect killing nematodes and fungi that

65
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,129
can be used so a wide variety of

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,979
biological biological controls are

67
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:30,900
available for threats the beneficial

68
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:33,149
insect killing nematodes that are used

69
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,890
against the fondant snap larvae may also

70
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,990
be effective against their pupae in

71
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,869
growing media so it kind of gives you

72
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,939
that dual action control could link to

73
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,370
YouTube is if YouTube it video you want

74
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,770
to see it in action there and also a

75
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,120
document here for more information this

76
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,040
again shows you the trip getting

77
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,439
infected here with biological controls

78
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,569
perturb using at greater rates now that

79
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,710
there's a buildup to resistance to

80
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,709
common insecticides
