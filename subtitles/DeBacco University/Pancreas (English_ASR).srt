1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,469
here we're gonna learn about the Pincus

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,108
which while it is an accessory organ to

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:10,649
the digestive system it is absolutely

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:13,138
necessary for the full process of

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,260
digestion to occur and ultimately their

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:18,000
survival of the human being so looking

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,618
at the pancreas where is it well it lies

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,269
to prostate to the stomach from the

9
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,460
duodenum towards the spleen

10
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,500
that's importance located here because

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,839
you'll notice the digestive enzymes are

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,399
directly entering the duodenum it's

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,390
important because remember the duodenum

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:36,629
is directly connected or receiving items

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,609
leaving the stomach so this is a very

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,109
important it's located here so it's

17
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:44,460
really seeing those enzymes into the

18
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:46,950
early part of these small intestine now

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,840
it produces its several enzymes a lipase

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,670
is one that are just fat mineral lipids

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,680
amylase which digest starts trypsin are

22
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,989
chymotrypsin which is important for the

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,609
digestion of proteins so you can see

24
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:01,320
just right there the pancreas is

25
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,448
secreting enzymes to break down proteins

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,140
starch which is your carbohydrates and

27
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:09,000
also your fats in order for these

28
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,618
enzymes to function properly since we

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,618
are just coming out of the stomach we

30
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,750
they don't perform well at a very low pH

31
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:18,478
the pancreas as a result will secrete

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,150
bicarbonate which in neutralizes HCL

33
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,340
just hydrochloric acid in the time as it

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,340
directly leaves the stomach needs to

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,280
raise that pH so these enzymes can work

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,439
at a more optimal rate in addition the

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,859
pancreas is also important for Richelieu

38
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:38,368
sub Iceland and glucagon which regulates

39
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:40,140
sugar levels in the blood now the

40
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:42,269
pancreas it more than 90 percent of

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,790
cells have a function for the digestive

42
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,289
system however the pancreas is also as

43
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,280
this end is important for maintaining

44
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,259
the body's blood glucose or sugar levels

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,509
primary hormone of the pancreas includes

46
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,329
insulin and glucagon to both regulate

47
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,489
the blue blood glucose levels diabetes

48
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:01,349
is the most common disorder associated

49
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,868
with the pancreas so looking at our

50
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:06,569
images here we see our normal we start

51
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:08,189
insulin going through binding

52
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,189
causing glucose to come in member

53
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,598
insulin glucose into the cells here we

54
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,469
have a dysfunction which is diabetes

55
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,419
type one

56
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,939
the destruction of the Wiesel's where

57
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,649
insulin is simply now produced by

58
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,090
insulin at being producers nothing to

59
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,480
receive the signal nothing to bring

60
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,030
glucose into the cells in contrast to

61
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,439
this we have type-2 diabetes well if we

62
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,629
don't see end results the same glucose

63
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,449
is not being uptake by the cells but in

64
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,729
this case we have insulin being produced

65
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:38,969
however there is insulin resistance on

66
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:41,280
the receptor so as a result here the

67
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:43,500
receptor cannot bind the insulin glucose

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,090
cannot enter the cell in this case

69
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,770
Muslims that main produce to this fully

70
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,960
functional receptor has nothing to bind

71
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,730
to on therefore doesn't allow glucose in

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,379
and this shows the normal condition

73
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,299
where we have our insulin being produced

74
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:57,629
binder receptor a lot of glucose to come

75
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,370
into the cell now kind of taking a look

76
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:03,299
at this and the direct relation to the

77
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,780
pancreas we have our increase and

78
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,520
decrease in glucose levels insulin being

79
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,409
released when it comes to high glucagon

80
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,760
when it gets too low bringing it up you

81
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:13,919
kind of see it's kind of maintained in

82
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,449
this tight range trying to keep a

83
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,979
constant level in the bodies through

84
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:19,109
this what we call negative feedback

85
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,149
system so it comes up too high release

86
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,650
it down so here we're trying to put it

87
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,390
into the cell to try to reduce blood

88
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,590
glucose oh it gets too low looking out

89
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,659
I'm gonna take it out of the cells we'll

90
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,090
bring it back up so we have this kind of

91
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,669
up and down negative feedback system

92
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,530
this is this modal line represents the

93
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:37,109
blood glucose level we're trying to keep

94
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,729
this in a Titan range so while it is

95
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,890
increasing and decreasing that's the

96
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:43,169
graph shows this is kept in a very close

97
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,569
range it's not massive swings up or down

98
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:48,000
up or down it's a very tight range we're

99
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:51,439
trying to average out on this line here

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,439
going right down the center
