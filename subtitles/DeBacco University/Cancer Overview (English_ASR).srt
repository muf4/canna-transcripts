1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,500
here I'm gonna go over a brief cancer

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,308
overview to kind of give you a little

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,870
bit of the background of what cancer is

4
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:12,300
so starting with the basic question of

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,129
what is cancer it's simply put it's an

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,900
abnormal cell growth in neoplasia

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,500
there's two different types though

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,899
here's a book benign in a malignant the

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,149
benign is very slow growth non-invasive

10
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,000
and malignant is rapid growth and be

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:29,098
very invasive the melina is much greater

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,379
concern in the benign here's a little

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,420
comparison between the two

14
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:36,420
benign very minimal nuclear variations

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,579
diploid low mitotic count cells remain

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,890
specialized or organized but they may

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,780
put forms of admirable functions the

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,878
malignant because of their rapid growth

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,899
they have very build nuclear variation

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,640
they range in ploidy they can be like a

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,509
diploid that you'd be haploid they could

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,850
be tetraploid all sorts of crazy things

23
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:58,890
low to high mitotic count loss of

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,719
specialization of functions lots of

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,609
organization often loses or function

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,219
that is growing out of control in

27
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,990
malignant

28
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:09,810
I'll come question maybe ask is is

29
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:12,269
cancer can I get it you know inherit

30
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,790
cancer well the majority of cancers are

31
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,408
not inherited only about five to ten

32
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,469
percent of all cancers are due to the

33
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,450
inherited gene defect a lot of it is

34
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:23,400
caused by the environment cancer is a

35
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,560
genetic disease but the majority of the

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,450
mutations that lead to cancer are

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,090
somatic the current are somatic cells

38
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,978
we're not going to pass those down to

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,350
our offspring within the five to ten

40
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:36,959
percent cancers that do occur from genes

41
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:38,640
include a couple here and then the

42
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,449
environmental factors here and you can

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,000
see how I'm tobacco products diet

44
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,649
infections obesity alcohol all

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,129
contribute to ninety to ninety-five

46
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,070
percent of all cancers what causes

47
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:55,739
cancer has mutations that lead to cancer

48
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:59,188
we have viruses bacteria chemicals UV

49
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,319
light all these can have different types

50
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:02,398
of cancers associated with them however

51
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,379
they all have something in common here

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
they are normal cells and we're never

53
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:08,038
seen our cancer cells are coming that

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,259
growing out of control there's kind of

55
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,208
that lost specialization that loss of

56
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,589
organization that's occurring with

57
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,450
cancer it's abnormal

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,330
cell growth and again there's a whole

59
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:21,509
host of potential sources it's not just

60
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,760
UV light it's not just viruses not just

61
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:26,009
chemicals each one of these may relate

62
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:30,689
to a specific type of cancer but all

63
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:35,780
these mutate our DNA immunes looking at

64
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:39,150
viruses viruses like HPV is one example

65
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:42,409
ages standardised s rates on this the

66
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,069
cervical cancer here by country per

67
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,810
100,000 inhabitants

68
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:47,039
and we could see where there's very

69
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,590
small amounts and where there's

70
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,199
increased risk this on the oranges to

71
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,939
red region this gives you an idea where

72
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,189
there's higher occurrence of this

73
00:02:53,939 --> 00:03:01,039
particular virus where the risk might be

74
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:03,799
higher for those individuals UV light

75
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,989
ultraviolet light is the ionizing

76
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,719
radiation and double and single stranded

77
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,120
DNA breaks we're having this incoming UV

78
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,769
photon and we're breaking apart portions

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,230
of this DNA this is how it's being

80
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,810
mutated and changed and there's

81
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:20,638
different findings that occur what this

82
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,039
is occurring is just simply a mutation

83
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,639
that can lead into just continued cell

84
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:29,608
growth and his could arrest the chance

85
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:34,950
for checks and balances for the cell to

86
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:38,400
go through boom distances chemicals DNA

87
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:40,379
in turn in tribulations this is where

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,120
we're intercalating our DNA this is

89
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,340
where chemicals might be binding towards

90
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,709
DNA when DNA becomes bound to

91
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,519
cancer-causing chemicals ethidium

92
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:54,870
bromide is one it's very well at binding

93
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:57,689
with DNA to used in some labs here this

94
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,430
is this gel it's DNA in it that has

95
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:01,709
atheneum bromide because it glows under

96
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,719
UV light so it's really easy when

97
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,269
running gels to be able to identify it

98
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,489
however because it by the DNA it's

99
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,560
non-discriminatory it's gonna bind it

100
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,019
the DNA in the gel or the DNA in your

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,340
cells as a result scientists at work

102
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,649
with this and I've worked at this before

103
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,750
it be very careful about having a

104
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,819
barrier between you in Athenian bromide

105
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,579
you notice gloves here stored in a very

106
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:26,310
protected in well labeled container

107
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:28,409
stored in this particular location hood

108
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,030
serve a purpose when he's properly but

109
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:34,639
can be a mutant McGann can cause cancer

110
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:37,739
what types of genes get mutated cancer

111
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,560
oncogenes are activated normal function

112
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,600
cells grow and genes are transcribed in

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,459
a normal cell this can be converted to a

114
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,919
cancer cell with the activation of these

115
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:49,918
oncogenes this is basically taking a

116
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:51,629
normal cell and transforming it causing

117
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,680
it to become a cancer cell and this is

118
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:58,500
typically evident by just unrestricted

119
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,418
growth that may occur increase rates of

120
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,689
replication and we see that loss of

121
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:05,549
specialization those tumor suppressor

122
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:08,279
genes are also could be inactivated

123
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,750
normal function DNA repair cell cycle

124
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,478
growth is normal leading to cell death

125
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,100
well tumor suppressor genes they go

126
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,978
through and they can inhibit proteins in

127
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,169
cell divisions under control however a

128
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,418
mutated portion here the tumor

129
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:23,609
suppressor gene is no longer active it's

130
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:25,649
just located here in the red region cell

131
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,410
division is now now under control

132
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:29,909
it's out of control and it's happening

133
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,340
too quickly and there's no checks and

134
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,500
balances we see the cells are taking on

135
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:37,199
slightly different shapes and a lot more

136
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,939
of them this is we as a result of tumor

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,839
suppressor genes being inactivated

138
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:44,550
characteristics in general the cancer

139
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,159
cell and this is again speaking in the

140
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,590
general overview kind of standpoint

141
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,570
self-sufficient growth signals activated

142
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,129
growth factors and signaling resistance

143
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:55,469
to anti-growth signals mean it doesn't

144
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:58,379
listen to shut down signals these

145
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,840
inactive a checkpoints it's constantly

146
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:02,639
going through division again again again

147
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,129
well then zap happens I tried to put

148
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,650
showed in the picture here we have a

149
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:10,500
cell that stress proliferating one cell

150
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:12,839
just massively reproducing and

151
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,879
ultimately or mutagens we noticed a

152
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,099
cancer cells here look nothing like the

153
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,379
original cells there's a lot more of

154
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,479
them this is the idea a concept of

155
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,978
tumors what are they there are those a

156
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:26,310
result of those cells that are just

157
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:29,959
growing out of control so

158
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:33,509
characteristics of a cancer cell to be

159
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:36,689
immortality reason cell death or having

160
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:38,139
our kilometers at the very end of our

161
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,538
chromosomes

162
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,879
here a young cell has them capped off

163
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:44,649
just nice aging cell will slowly lose

164
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,830
them when they're basically all gone the

165
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:49,538
cell dies well what the cancer cell ends

166
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:51,668
up doing is it kind of puts a little cap

167
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:53,408
on the end by putting that cap on the

168
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:54,998
end it's constantly has these present

169
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:57,218
these cells are gonna have it like that

170
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:59,590
in mortis all their constant going to be

171
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:01,689
able to go to cell division and again I

172
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:03,218
look back here this constant growth and

173
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:05,770
cell division is what's causing the

174
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:07,899
issues here yeah these are some other

175
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:11,258
characteristics of cancer cells there's

176
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:13,538
six total loser three and four also

177
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,098
resistance to cell death and the cell

178
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:16,839
doesn't die just keeps dividing keeps

179
00:07:15,098 --> 00:07:18,158
dividing there's normally these checks

180
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:22,508
and balances to reduce that from

181
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:24,339
occurring the other characteristics we

182
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,439
have increased branching that occur

183
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,908
these signals that can cause this

184
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,218
branching now the reason why this is a

185
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:32,259
character this characteristic of a

186
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:33,430
cancer cell is because they're growing

187
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:35,830
out of control they need a lot more

188
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,389
exchange of nutrients therefore they're

189
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:39,550
gonna have the blood vessels around them

190
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:41,800
start to branch out so they can get more

191
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,870
surface area to volume ratio so they can

192
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,228
exchange nutrients and waste a lot more

193
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,658
efficiently mastitis another one loss of

194
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:51,338
cell to cell interactions we're having

195
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:53,199
this abnormal just growth that's

196
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,939
occurred again here's one it's got the

197
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,830
mutation we see the progression over

198
00:07:54,939 --> 00:08:01,240
time to an invasive cancer cell tumor

199
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:04,598
suppressor genes our guardians of the

200
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,759
genome they're involved in maintaining

201
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:09,550
genome integrity they were possible for

202
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,449
DNA repair mutants and tumor suppressor

203
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:15,430
genes lead to mutator phenotype mutation

204
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:18,250
rates increase often the first mutation

205
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,478
in the developing cancer so we have

206
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,028
these genes that basically like brakes

207
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:23,408
on a car the goal is to slow down cell

208
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:26,228
growth and prevent the carbon in the

209
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:27,728
wall well if we modify these and kind of

210
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:29,859
take these safety and checks and

211
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:30,908
balances out well what's gonna happen

212
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,849
that's basic it's like a car with no

213
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:35,979
brakes it's gonna run into the cell wall

214
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,690
and this is just an example of running

215
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:41,649
into kind of dead cancer getting that

216
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,870
out of control this p53 is a classic

217
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:46,179
tumor suppressor suppresses genomic

218
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,089
damage it halts the cell cycle if the

219
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:50,419
DNA is irreparable p53 will initiate

220
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:52,339
cell death

221
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:54,500
the prices we call apoptosis that's

222
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,820
programmed cell death and that's a soul

223
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,379
being able to go through a realizing

224
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,350
somebody's not right and basically

225
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:04,578
killed itself off so it has stability

226
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,200
within the cell apoptosis again it's

227
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:09,259
programmed cell death this does occur

228
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,570
normally the cells no longer needed they

229
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:14,569
commit suicide by activating these

230
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,370
intracellular death program this is

231
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,589
different than cancer this is a normal

232
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,899
process so they'll go back again this

233
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:22,699
apoptosis this is the cell realizing

234
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,078
something's not right given itself off

235
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:27,319
of the better of the tissue of the

236
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:29,388
organism this does occur our toes and

237
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,860
our fingers all right there's no webbing

238
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:32,750
here there were cells when we were

239
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,519
really small that or in here throughout

240
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,799
the process of apoptosis were able now

241
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,078
to get individual fingers good see here

242
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:42,169
this didn't occur quite as it should

243
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,099
have as the other toes some animals it's

244
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:44,899
the male duck here

245
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,278
what webbing on their feet is there

246
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,440
nothing that apoptosis of those

247
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:49,730
particular cells wait for our hands

248
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,279
tubes who want to be either grab things

249
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,600
more efficiently

250
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:57,110
chromastone instability is another thing

251
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,850
that can cause issues and mutations here

252
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,339
we're noticing a nice separation these

253
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,709
chromosomes will occur here our spindle

254
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:06,800
fibers inaccurately grab two of them I'm

255
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:09,078
gonna pull them in a weird format tune

256
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,939
to the top hole and none are gonna come

257
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:13,000
down here this is gonna cause an

258
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,589
instability within the cell

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,409
well cancer therapy is target so

260
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:20,510
classical cancer therapies target

261
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:23,059
rapidly dividing cells they're turning

262
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:27,350
the DNA it could be a craze to kill

263
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:29,119
target cells in this example here person

264
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:32,778
would lay down on the table here this is

265
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,730
gonna fire very precise x-rays ideally

266
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:37,100
these gamma rays are gonna go through

267
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,470
and target that specific cancer cell and

268
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,829
attack it from different angles to help

269
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:45,139
to stop it from growing other things

270
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:47,899
that are targeting these rapidly

271
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:49,100
dividing cells is chemotherapy you serve

272
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,190
the drugs throughout the entire body

273
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,470
again to really example some of them to

274
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,230
really target and pinpoint those rapidly

275
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,730
dividing cells however as many side

276
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,190
effects with chemotherapy if you sadly

277
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,420
known as gone through this everyone's

278
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,310
experiences a little bit differently

279
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:07,068
here's some very common

280
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:09,409
symptoms again hair loss weakened immune

281
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:11,448
system loss of appetite area there's

282
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:13,490
different grades of those and you can

283
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:15,289
see again the goal is to try to reduce

284
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,850
the amount of side effects and again

285
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:19,188
it's gonna depend on the individual in

286
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:22,370
the severity of their particular side

287
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:24,169
effects that they're going to have other

288
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,179
therapies person's immune system will

289
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:29,088
not be at a target tumor cells because

290
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:31,278
this surface proteins appear to be self

291
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:33,230
so how did this cancer cell to begin us

292
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,019
and why isn't our body suppressing it

293
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:40,159
what appears to be self the recognition

294
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:41,990
markers do not throw up any red flags so

295
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,698
that our normal immune systems that I

296
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,039
took is not going to target those cells

297
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:47,688
so new therapies are focusing on

298
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,149
activating someone's immune system

299
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:51,409
against a cancer cell because it been in

300
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,028
our immune system to recognize these

301
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:54,889
cells something's that going right here

302
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:56,480
they could potentially attack the cells

303
00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:00,259
and stop it from growing into a large

304
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,789
tumor modern and targeted therapies

305
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,649
attack specific proteins that are

306
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:05,179
abnormally expressed in the tumor they

307
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:07,578
can block over the expressed growth

308
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:09,198
factors generally there are a few side

309
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:11,929
effects from this it's so targeted

310
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:13,878
however we cut it so targeted it's very

311
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:16,159
difficult to develop these technologies

312
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,569
advances are being made which is great

313
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,759
as we learn more about cell to cell

314
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:24,049
recognition but it takes a lot of

315
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:25,579
research it's very specific the polio

316
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:27,649
virus in cancer there's some great

317
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,229
research coming out with this this is

318
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:33,019
the polio virus it creates very negative

319
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,909
effects to the body crippling effects

320
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,948
potentially deadly infections by a virus

321
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:39,558
invading that person's brain the spinal

322
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:43,068
cord causing paralysis causing basically

323
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:45,948
death and kind of not a good way between

324
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:47,568
two and ten out of a hundred people who

325
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:49,338
have paralysis from polio virus

326
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:50,778
infection and die because the virus

327
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,750
affects muscles that help them breathe

328
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:56,088
stops the diaphragm essentially so this

329
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,958
is a very nasty virus causes a lot of

330
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:02,870
death however it is being used to try to

331
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:06,169
treat cancer so I've provided you three

332
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,389
links here to a 60 minutes TV spot and

333
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:10,789
how the polio virus is being used to

334
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:13,789
fight cancer it's a bold treatment and

335
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:15,259
it's granting breakthrough status what

336
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:16,750
the goal is to try to take away some of

337
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,960
the virulence of the polio virus

338
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,360
injected

339
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,759
carousel as a way to help the immune

340
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,620
system recognize the cancer cell to be

341
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,169
able to suppress tumors invisibly have

342
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,690
one's own immune system take care and

343
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:32,209
clean up the tumor some excellent videos

344
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,220
here I'll provide some great ways to be

345
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,980
able to see how something that's very

346
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,960
deadly could potentially be used to save

347
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,879
someone's life so invite you to check

348
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,080
those videos out hopefully this is

349
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,750
helpful to give you a kind of a brief

350
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:48,190
overview of what cancer is what some

351
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,190
potential causes are for it
