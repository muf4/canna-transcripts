1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,600
many growers go through and purchase a

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,759
drip irrigation system

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,960
but a lot of questions arise for how

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,199
long should i run it

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,039
what drip tape should i purchase here on

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,079
this tobacco university video

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,638
we're going to go over some of those

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,920
calculations to get you over and past

9
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,919
that learning curve

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,198
all right let's get into drip irrigation

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,240
calculations for outdoor cannabis

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,960
production

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,799
so first off realize that there are many

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,399
calculations that are possible

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,320
so many ways to go about calculating

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,320
water in regards to drip irrigation

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,480
the following that we presented here is

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,039
generally the suggested process to go

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,878
through

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,960
when it comes to planning for your drip

21
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,558
irrigation system not the only way

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,399
but it is at least one way and i'll walk

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,799
you through those steps

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
so first off step one is determine the

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,399
drip tape

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,679
required so take your plot design which

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,399
hopefully you've constructed

28
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,840
and determine the total number of drip

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,000
tape that you would need

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,760
are you looking at a very small area or

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
looking at a very large area

32
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,519
so for example if you had 12 rows of

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,799
plants each 80 feet long

34
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,879
12 rows 80 feet each you need 960 feet

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,080
of drip tape so again doesn't matter if

36
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,000
you're a small operation or a large

37
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,560
operation this calculation still needs

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,159
to be

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,840
gone through so you know exactly how

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,920
much to purchase

41
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,478
then step part two is to calculate the

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,920
source of water and your flow rate

43
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,679
so a simple way to calculate this is

44
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,560
simply get a five gallon pail

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,159
and a timer turn the water on full start

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,359
filling the pail up and start the timer

47
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,280
at the same time

48
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,719
when the pail is full stop the timer

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
this will provide you the time

50
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,560
it takes to reach five gallons take this

51
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,759
time and figure out how many gallons per

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,200
minute you have

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,599
you could also do this filled up right

54
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,118
to a gallon or two gallons

55
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,199
but kind of get you the idea of that

56
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,680
flow rate that you have so for example

57
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,439
if it takes 23 seconds to fill the pail

58
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,079
60 seconds 23 23.26 0.26 times the 5

59
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,679
gallons

60
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:02,078
would be 13.04 gallons per minute

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,920
it takes you 72 seconds to fill the pail

62
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,239
and again this is a 5 gallon pail

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,960
60 seconds divided by the 72 times it by

64
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,000
the five

65
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,840
gives you 4.6 gallons per minute

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
so it's a quick easy way to calculate

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,759
and what your flow rate is

68
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
now as a word of caution don't do this

69
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,120
right at the source if you have

70
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,039
filters or timers or anything that's

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,680
going to restrict the flow rate

72
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,239
do this calculation after all of that

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,760
equipment

74
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,000
so you're getting an actual flow rate

75
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,919
that's going to go to your drip tapes

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
then you want to select the drip tape so

77
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,318
there's a lot of different manufacturers

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
out there

79
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,518
but here we're just going to look at

80
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
some of the basics the emitter spacing

81
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,000
and flow

82
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,760
rate eight inch and minus spacing is

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,759
recommended for sandy soil

84
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,199
and high density planting so you've got

85
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,239
a lot of plants in a small area and very

86
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,839
sandy soil that water's going to

87
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,039
percolate through very quickly

88
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,039
eight inches would be recommended in

89
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,159
that situation however most situations

90
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,479
you're looking at 12-inch emitter

91
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,159
spacing is considered to be the standard

92
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,238
and we could see some of them listed

93
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,000
right here the flow rate there's low

94
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,480
flow and there's high flow

95
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,560
low flow is greater for longer run times

96
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,679
and allows for more tape to be run

97
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,199
uh is is the flow rate is restrictive so

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,439
low flow allows you to run more tapes

99
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,518
because they're flowing less water

100
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,639
high flow shorter run times for when

101
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,158
flow rates are not

102
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,759
restrict if you have excessive amount of

103
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,000
gallons per minute you can go with a

104
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,439
high flow and reduce your total duration

105
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
the plants will still receive the same

106
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,079
amount of water and here we see a

107
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,400
calculated

108
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,680
flow rate per 100 feet at 8 psi you

109
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
should be running your drip tape with a

110
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
10 psi

111
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,400
pressure reducer and we see the low flow

112
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,000
can run 700 feet high flow 460. so again

113
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
if you're a larger operation

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,598
sometimes that lower flow might be

115
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,759
advantageous

116
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:40,639
then the what's how long or what time

117
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,679
does it take

118
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,798
to apply um one inch of water

119
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,959
so here we're looking at time to apply

120
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,719
one inch of water in hours low flow

121
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,598
medium flow high flow rates emitter

122
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,080
spacing

123
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,798
drip tube flow rate drip tube flow rate

124
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
at eight

125
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,040
psi here gallons per minute per hundred

126
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,840
feet this is gallons per hour per

127
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,000
hundred feet

128
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,759
and the time it takes to apply one inch

129
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,280
of water in hours

130
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,359
a lot of times one inch of water per

131
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,438
week is considered to be the standard

132
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,239
and as an example drip tape with a flow

133
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,959
rate of 0.45 gallons per minute per 100

134
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,680
feet

135
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
will take about 5.8 hours to apply one

136
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,319
inch

137
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,798
of water so that would be running it for

138
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,719
approximately that just under an hour

139
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,159
every day would get you to that one inch

140
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,680
of water per week

141
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,199
and here again we see all the options

142
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,240
that we have which is great gets a

143
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,280
little confusing

144
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,478
but if you kind of go through and

145
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,319
determine what drip tape you're

146
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,560
purchasing what your emitter spacing is

147
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,159
this can again give you a very good

148
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,600
starting point

149
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,520
now situation one so i'm going to walk

150
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,479
you through some examples here uh if you

151
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,758
have more gallons

152
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,120
per minute from the source than is

153
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,560
required if you've got excessive amount

154
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
of water this is niagara falls

155
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,319
i don't have that much water but if you

156
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,400
have seven gallons per minute flow rate

157
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,000
and you're running 960 feet of drip tape

158
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,279
with a 12 inch emitter spacing

159
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,360
and you're choosing to get the high flow

160
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,039
drip tape which is 0.45 gallons per

161
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,960
minute per 100 feet drip tape

162
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
the time required to apply one inch of

163
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,519
water would be 5.8 hours

164
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,199
how do we go about calculating this well

165
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,599
drip tape flow

166
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,639
requires 4.32 gallons per minute again

167
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,479
we have seven

168
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,600
run drip tape for 50 minutes to deliver

169
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,680
216 gallons

170
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,639
running this for seven days equals four

171
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
point of

172
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,439
5.8 hours of a run time to match the one

173
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,639
inch of water per week recommendation

174
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,399
and it went through that kind of crash

175
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,319
but you can kind of go through and plug

176
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,879
in your own numbers and see how they may

177
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,279
fit

178
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,800
so you can determine exactly how long to

179
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,439
run your water for

180
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,319
again 50 minutes here times the 4.32

181
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,399
gallons per minute

182
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,439
gets you the 216 gallons which would be

183
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,239
about that one inch

184
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,519
per week now situation two is that what

185
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,038
if you have less gallons per minutes

186
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,198
than the source requires a little water

187
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,560
short same seven gallons per minute flow

188
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,919
rate but now we're trying to run three

189
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,038
thousand feet of drip tape

190
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,279
same emitter spacing same flow rate well

191
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,000
here now we're acquiring 13.5 gallons

192
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,918
per minute

193
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,160
but remember stated up here the source

194
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,439
can only supply seven gallons per minute

195
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,240
so there needs to be two

196
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,959
zones made with a valve so that 1 500

197
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,800
feet of drip tape runs at one time

198
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,758
run the drip tape for 50 minutes to

199
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,240
deliver 6.75 gallons per minute times 15

200
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,800
minutes

201
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,519
would equal 337 gallons running this for

202
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
seven days

203
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,959
equals to 5.8 hours of run time to match

204
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,159
the one inch of water per week

205
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,159
recommendation

206
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,240
so again here if we have 7 gallons per

207
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,919
minute but we need 13 and a half simply

208
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
dividing your area into different

209
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,120
zones will allow you to meet those

210
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,560
recommendations

211
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,800
and again this all comes back to

212
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,319
calculating your water source

213
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,680
so hopefully if you pause the video look

214
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,360
back at this it's going to provide you

215
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,478
with some helpful information

216
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,800
to go about applying your own flow rates

217
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,399
and drip tape to these calculations to

218
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,879
ensure your plants are at least starting

219
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,719
with

220
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,319
one inch per water per week and you can

221
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,319
make adjustments from there
