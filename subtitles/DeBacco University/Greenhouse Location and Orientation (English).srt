Narrator: Okay. When looking at a greenhouse,  because it's a permanent structure, we should  

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,730
be very concerned with the location and the  orientation of that particular structure,  

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,920
because it's going to be fixed in place, and  we want to maximize plant productivity within  

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,839
that particular grow area. Important to make  the distinction between greenhouses and high  

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,490
tunnels. Greenhouses are permanent structures.  They typically have heat and electricity, and a  

6
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,140
permanent floor. Generally speaking, compared to  high tunnels, they are more expensive and they can  

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,539
cover larger areas. High tunnels are the basic  structures, are basically poly here and hoops,  

8
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,159
plants that are grown right in soil. As  a result, they're less expensive. They  

9
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,879
don't really allow for a full, calendar-year  production, especially in colder climates,  

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,150
and typically cover 4,000 square feet or less. Now, focusing, again, on the greenhouse  

11
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,670
production, these are permanent locations. As  a result, growers have control over many of  

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,310
the climactic conditions. They also provide  consistency, and a fixed plant moving and  

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,379
support structures here. Because they are  solid, fixed structures, it allows growers  

14
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,079
to plan accordingly to maximize plant production.  They're well suited for full-year production, and  

15
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,989
they can have supplemental lighting added, also,  to them. This is a cloudy day, and you can see,  

16
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:22,289
a little hard to see, not a lot of sun. We have  some supplemental lights on, air circulation,  

17
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,540
also, is important. That's helping us maintain  our plants in the right photo period and also  

18
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,890
receiving sufficient light. Again, those permanent  locations allow for adequate planning, and running  

19
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,750
here are irrigation lines and heating lines.  You can also see supplemental lighting in here.  

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,849
Now, location of the greenhouses should be in  an area that gets maximum sunlight exposure for  

21
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:52,079
the entire year. Large, flat areas, can have  easy access to water and electricity to run  

22
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,950
to them is advised. It might be an ideal  location, right in the middle of a field,  

23
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,680
here, but if we can't run water and electricity,  it's going to present an issue. Want to consider,  

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,925
also, ease of access by vehicles to transport  material to and from the facility, that could  

25
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:09,780
be potting media, that could be end product.  Don't want to have it in the middle of nowhere.  

26
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,620
You want to kind of pick a good location  and consider all these particular factors.  

27
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,090
Now, the orientation of the greenhouse should  be based on the season. It's going to match  

28
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,370
up with the main productive cycle. For fall, and  winter, spring production, it's advised to orient  

29
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,140
the greenhouse in an east-to-west to help  capture lower sun angle effectively. However, a  

30
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:37,299
north-to-south orientation is advised to maximize  light penetration and benefit ventilation,  

31
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:43,210
also. The orientation may not be 100% chosen  because there's constraints of certain areas,  

32
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,310
but depending when you want to run your main  production cycle, may influence the exact  

33
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,930
orientation, to the north, south, east, west  direction you choose to run your greenhouse.
