1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,198
in this video lecture here at tobacco

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,278
university we're going to be

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,480
investigating a fire and trying to

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,599
determine whether it was an

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,240
accident or arson and what clues

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,638
can help us indicate what category of

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
fire may fall into

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,719
so accidental fires typically they're

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,800
going to be sources of

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,719
heating system electrical equipment

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,278
children playing with matches smoking

12
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,439
cooking all those would be classified or

13
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,399
fall under the category of an accidental

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,160
fire

15
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,079
now when we're looking at non-accidental

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
fire clues well and obviously wouldn't

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,120
be obvious odors and gas or kerosene

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,640
for example in the area lack of personal

19
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,878
objects and valuables if they're all

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,558
kind of removed for some reason

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,839
in the fire none of those are found that

22
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,038
could be an indication that may have

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,640
been pre-planned

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,399
also checking debris for closing such as

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,239
buttons or zippers windows and doors

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,679
being locked or blocked could also be an

27
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,078
indication sadly of a

28
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,119
non-accidental fire more than one point

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,600
of origin indicating

30
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,959
starting at multiple areas inverted v

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
patterns the sign that an

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,079
accelerant was used and charred floors

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,478
can indicate the use of an accelerant so

34
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,359
this

35
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,079
uses of accelerant could lead us to

36
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,319
believe it'd be a non-accidental fire

37
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,438
now suspicious circumstances involved

38
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,000
well the presence of

39
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,519
combustibles to aid and increase the

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,799
rate of combustion if there's a lot of

41
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:23,438
paper left around newspaper for example

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,159
or just wood items can help increase

43
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,319
that rate

44
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,080
of combustion these are frequently

45
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,839
detected by canines

46
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,679
trained to detect ignitable liquids by

47
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
smelling fire debris again if those

48
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
accelerants

49
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,879
were used for example the investigators

50
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,719
can also detect the presence of these

51
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,759
liquids from poor patterns

52
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,078
investigating how a burn pattern may be

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,879
may have occurred and they can remain on

54
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,879
the burn

55
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,560
substrate after the fire which can

56
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,199
indicate clearly there was gasoline

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,200
added

58
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,040
as an example and that would be clear

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,280
evidence that it'd be very suspicious

60
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,680
and probably not a you know just one

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,960
that happened by accident

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,960
now if we're looking at arson in

63
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:05,039
particular of potential motives

64
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,478
for starting a fire while they are many

65
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,560
sometimes we're looking at you know

66
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,199
crime concealment something else was to

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,840
occur

68
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,159
uh to conceal crime such as a murder or

69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
a robbery of some kind

70
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,239
someone's just out of spite to get back

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
at someone monetary gain for looking at

72
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,319
profit from the fire this could be

73
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,039
due to insurance coverage a competitor

74
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:24,958
of a business

75
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,079
anything like that regards sometimes

76
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,319
just vandalism

77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,080
uh where fire sets someone's property

78
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,560
just to destroy it

79
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,160
this is the largest percentage of arson

80
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
fires which are typically set by

81
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,598
juveniles and then we have the mentally

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
disturbed and some people just have been

83
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,479
found to be kind of have that

84
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,319
impulse for whatever reason to set fires

85
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,598
now we talked about this poor pattern so

86
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,518
poor patterns are

87
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,518
typically we're looking at use of an

88
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,560
accelerant being determined to be used

89
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,080
these poor patterns are often

90
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
characterized by an intermix light

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,879
medium

92
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
heavy burning in a puddle shape that

93
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,919
corresponds to the shape of the original

94
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,239
pool of the ignitable

95
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,439
liquid so that is important to try to

96
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,680
identify that

97
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,560
and the fire remains so you can start

98
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,719
investigating this in more detail

99
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,199
now indicators of the flammable liquid

100
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,719
use we're looking at an unnatural flame

101
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,238
movement that could be downwards or

102
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,039
simply occurring

103
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,519
faster than would be expected kind of

104
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,598
the

105
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,439
grapping of wood or floor seams caused

106
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,359
by the pooling of a liquid

107
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,199
and no identifiable point of origin of a

108
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
fire it's kind of like spread out over a

109
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,359
region

110
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,199
probably indicates that they're an

111
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,920
accelerant or a flammable liquid

112
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,119
was used which indicates or favors

113
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,598
strongly

114
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
arson being the main cause flowing

115
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,798
underneath appliances and furniture is

116
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
burned typically these objects would

117
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,120
shield

118
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
flames so some people may want to start

119
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,439
the fire under there to make it seem

120
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,279
like

121
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,598
for example the stove cotton fire for

122
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,280
example for noticing inverted

123
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,359
cone-shaped burn patterns on vertical

124
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,719
surfaces this can also indicate a

125
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,239
flammable liquid was most likely used

126
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,318
now these v-burn patterns the classic

127
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,200
v-shape is the normal burn pattern

128
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,158
so this inverted v or cone tends to

129
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,479
indicate

130
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,639
that an accident or use of an accelerant

131
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,959
was used we see that here

132
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,000
with looking at the refrigerator and we

133
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,840
see that clear

134
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,280
kind of point of origin we see that v

135
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,280
pattern developing we see clear

136
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
evidence of this door having minimal

137
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
damage indicating that fire started

138
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
definitely on this left panel of the

139
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,199
image

140
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
burn pattern with the accelerant so keep

141
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,360
in mind that

142
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,720
we're looking at possible areas of an

143
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
accelerant being used

144
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,800
we have different ways we can kind of

145
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,319
pattern those

146
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,079
there's al goring which is a possible

147
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,959
accelerant use which is looking at

148
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,478
scaling

149
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,000
there's breakaway layers such as

150
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,478
spalding that

151
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,079
was possible excellent usage as well if

152
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,319
we have streamers or tails

153
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,439
in that accelerant again helping

154
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,599
indicate that

155
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,360
some flammable liquid may have been used

156
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,759
or poor plant maybe that puddle

157
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,560
uh indicating something was poured in an

158
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,479
area

159
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,399
and here we have the evidence of an

160
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,800
accelerant burn pattern on a con

161
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,239
concrete floor um and kind of what that

162
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
may look like now we also don't want to

163
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
forget about electrical

164
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,160
burn patterns and they cause an arc

165
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,879
damage in the evidence of an electrical

166
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,880
fire

167
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,719
so these can also create points of

168
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,000
origin as well

169
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,000
and something to look at and these could

170
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,439
definitely be accidental

171
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,879
we want to be looking at circuits how

172
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,000
well how much they're loaded i look at

173
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,918

175
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,478
the potential use of accelerants

176
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,000
such as flammable liquids or gasoline we

177
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,639
can't also forget about

178
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
looking and investigating the potential

179
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,079
for electricity

180
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,079
to be the source of the fire
