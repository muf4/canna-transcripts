1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
here we give you a brief idea and how to

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,898
search for scientific articles so matter

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,629
what search engine you use going through

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,129
and finding good scientific articles it

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,440
can be a little bit of a challenge or a

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,170
daunting task at least initially which I

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,509
think you'll find it quite easy so first

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,460
off I suggest starting with Google

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,368
Scholar so go right into Google type in

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,740
Google Scholar and then use that subset

11
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,179
search engine I simply type Google

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,768
Scholar and it comes should come right

13
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,448
up reason why I like you starting with

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:33,359
this is it's a great user friendly

15
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,329
search engine that's also free it's a

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,710
very powerful tool to at least find some

17
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,570
of the articles that are out there

18
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,049
sadly you'll find many articles that you

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,850
have to pay for so as a result once you

20
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:47,429
find that articles name in title and

21
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,739
wyman have full access to it if you are

22
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,390
a University University Libraries

23
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,878
typically have access to a lot of those

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,100
for free this is often an underutilized

25
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,689
resource by students it's a great

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,149
resources but often give me a challenge

27
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,439
at the actual search search aspect so

28
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,290
tight like Google Scholar that gave you

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,938
the title the author some dates more

30
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,760
powerful tools that you can use to

31
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:11,188
pinpoint and find the exact article if

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,630
you do find that information via another

33
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,118
search engine it can really improve the

34
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:17,548
efficiency of a university based library

35
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,859
have access to so many on the rare case

36
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,780
if you can't find it but you want full

37
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:23,310
access to it if you do email the library

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,129
in a lot of cases it might go to get the

39
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,740
article or search it for you so again

40
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,298
just things to keep into consideration

41
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:32,489
because having access in knowing where

42
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,590
to find scientific research can be a

43
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,478
very powerful tool not only in your

44
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,609
undergraduate and graduate career but

45
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,908
just in general to be able to read

46
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:45,239
really detailed and current resource and

47
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,700
information about topics lied to develop

48
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:49,769
a good interest in good some materials

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,560
and methods and looking at the other

50
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:56,478
sources that they use can really expand

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,478
your knowledge on any particular subject
