1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,480
so many labs will provide you with

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:08,080
soil test reports of aluminum and lead

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,919
even though it may not be part of

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,718
nutrients you're looking for for your

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,400
plants

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,718
but these two can be potential

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,039
contaminants so it's a good idea

8
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,320
to look at those numbers and to realize

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,560
what harm they can cause

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,560
and what levels are considered high so

11
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:31,839
this tobacco university video will

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:31,839
hopefully answer some of those questions

13
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,879
so let's get into potential containments

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,920
of aluminum and lead in the soil test

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,079
report

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,719
so first off aluminum is not an

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,120
essential plant nutrient

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,120
though it's commonly seen in some soils

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,359
high levels of aluminum in the soil can

20
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,919
also interfere with plant uptake

21
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,079
of phosphorus and may cause injury of

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,280
sensitive plant species like lettuce

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,759
and beets as soil ph decreases

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,920
the solubility of aluminum increases

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,959
it's an inverse relationship here

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,400
we could see here there's our aluminum

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,000
concentration in parts per million

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,799
here's our changing ph

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,319
as we become more acidic we're noticing

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,680
an increase in the aluminum

31
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,519
concentration here

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
and typically above fights five parts

33
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,079
per million because they're toxic to

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,679
tolerant species

35
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,118
well less than two parts million is

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,640
generally considered non-toxic and we

37
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,000
can see just how a simple change

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,640
in ph can really impact that

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,920
now as i said ph does impact aluminum

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,719
this can also be seen

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,280
with plants in the degree that they are

42
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,478
able

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
to produce roots soil test results often

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,000
indicate

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
elevated aluminum levels in soil with ph

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,920
levels below

47
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,798
5.0 liming soils which will increase the

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,118
ph

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,040
to an acceptable level for the crop

50
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,759
being grown will typically reduce the

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
amount of

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
aluminum that's available to plants and

53
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,199
that can be a good thing

54
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,959
acid-loving plants like rhododendrons

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,520
blueberries azaleas

56
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,959
have high tolerance to soil aluminum

57
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,679
levels so for those plants

58
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,199
perfectly fine however aluminum is also

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,240
responsible for the blue color of

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,239
hydrangeas

61
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,439
because of its effect on pigmentation

62
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,800
formation

63
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,479
which is why the blue flowering

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,360
hydrangeas are grown in

65
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,119
low soil ph levels and here we're seeing

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
just the example that

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,599
ph of 5.1 the 4.0 can have on the root

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,319
development

69
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,439
simply because of the alteration in the

70
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:30,079
availability of aluminum in that soil

71
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,079
now going on to lead so lead is a

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,920
naturally occurring element in soils and

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,640
typically is present in soils

74
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,159
in the range of about 5 to 100 parts per

75
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,799
million total lead

76
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,519
soil test results indicate an estimation

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,280
of the

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,680
total lead it's always good to just have

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,159
an idea and look at that number

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,319
so what how do you determine whether or

81
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,199
not your lead levels are of reason of

82
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:52,799
concern

83
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,479
well only when total lead levels

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
typically exceed about 400 parts per

85
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,878
million does a u.s

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,759
environmental protection agency the epa

87
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,000
list it as an

88
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,679
element of concern if the lead levels

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,360
are elevated you should receive

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,640
appropriate information about potential

91
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800
problems with elevated

92
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,719
lead levels and guarding practices to

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
minimize exposure to lead

94
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,199
we kind of see just a general example

95
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,039
here of soil lead concentrations

96
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,958
keep in mind as we get above 100 parts

97
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,479
per billion we should be keeping

98
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,519
children out of the garden do not grow

99
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,598
root crops

100
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,439
safe to grow legumes fruiting and leafy

101
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,798
vegetables getting above 400

102
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,639
that's bringing to a lot more

103
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,719
restrictions but even at just above

104
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,000
100 typically want to start to take

105
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,400
caution if you are

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,919
seeing lead lead levels above 100 you

107
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,840
may want to contact the lab or see if

108
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,158
the lab is any information

109
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
about what might be safe or not safe to

110
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,359
grow there

111
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,799
in the soil lead levels and here we see

112
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,319
another little comparison chart here

113
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,599
interpreting the estimation of total

114
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,839
lead and soils

115
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,518
because there's no federal standards for

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
soil lead that has been determined for

117
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,200
soils where vegetables

118
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,840
will be grown it is well known that

119
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,759
plants vary in their uptake of soil lead

120
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
but generally lead will accumulate in

121
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,239
leafy green tissues

122
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,000
and in plant roots the university of

123
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,759
connecticut soil nutrient analysis

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,840
laboratory strongly recommends that

125
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,560
soils containing 400 parts per million

126
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,438
total lead or greater than that number

127
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,080
should not be used for growing

128
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,839
vegetables

129
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,919
herbs or other food crops however even

130
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,679
levels under that there still might be

131
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,918
reason for some concern

132
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,199
typically a hundred and less no real

133
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,839
precautions necessary

134
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,960
but as we get over 100 we start getting

135
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,799
more and more

136
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,039
suggested actions and restrictions

137
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
potentially on crops to grow in that

138
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,639
particular soil

139
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,079
so best measurement practices for garden

140
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,759
soil containing lead

141
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,758
well i've got a whole bunch kind of

142
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,120
listed here again you're welcome to

143
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,680
pause the video and take a better look

144
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,439
at it

145
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,519
but generally gardens should be located

146
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,360
away from older painted structures

147
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,279
and heavily traveled roads because there

148
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,800
was once led in

149
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:57,198
the gasoline and also lead in paint

150
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,879
giving planting preference for fruiting

151
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,160
crops like tomato squash peppers and

152
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,279
soils or elevated

153
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,400
lead bubbles remove outside

154
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,159
leaves of green leafy vegetables peel

155
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,319
the root crops and wash all vegetables

156
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,120
thoroughly to remove soil particles

157
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,199
maintain a soil ph of 6.5 to 7.0 by

158
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,478
applying limestone at recommended rates

159
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,720
because this will reduce the

160
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,199
availability of lead uptaken by the

161
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,880
plants

162
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,879
so again we see that ph being very

163
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,240
important maintain student organic

164
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,680
matter between five and ten percent

165
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,759
organic particles will bind the lead

166
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,959
making it less available to plant uptake

167
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,879
and in general we want to be shooting

168
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,719
for that general five percent

169
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,478
is just a general target 10 is getting

170
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,840
up there but that can help reduce the

171
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,279
availability of lead

172
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,560
maintain soil phosphorus levels by

173
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,559
applying the recommended amounts of

174
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,560
fertilizer to the garden plots

175
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
phosphorus can reduce lead uptake by

176
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,879
plants minimize dust and exposure to

177
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,639
bare soil through the use of mulches

178
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,079
wash hands thoroughly after contact of

179
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,680
lead contaminated soils

180
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,758
do not bring food or drinks into the

181
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,600
area with contaminated lead soils

182
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
soil and tools gloves shoes have

183
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,280
elevated levels also clean before

184
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,879
storing or bringing indoors

185
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,879
and lastly considered raised beds or

186
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,800
containerized plantings in soils with

187
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,560
elevated lead levels

188
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,160
and i put the resource there at the

189
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,959
bottom for a fact sheet if you want to

190
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,759
learn more

191
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,159
but keep in mind knowing if your soil is

192
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,639
high

193
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,319
in lead you cannot tell by looking you

194
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,680
have to go through and take a soil test

195
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,240
it's highly recommended you do in

196
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,720
general

197
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,478
but also take a look at the lead levels

198
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,120
because that may determine what you can

199
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,279
grow

200
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,319
it's definitely good to know what the

201
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,559
nutrients and ph

202
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,560
are and whether that soil is safe to

203
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,800
grow whatever food crops you're planning

204
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
on
