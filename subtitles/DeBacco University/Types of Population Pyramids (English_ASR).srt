1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,528
okay here we're gonna be looking at

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,028
types of population pyramids this kind

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,660
of gives you a just a general overview

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:12,120
here rapidly expanding population

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,339
pyramid in expanding stationary in a

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,500
contracting one this is also how they

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,420
look here a little bit more detail in

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,939
this is the general shape and this is

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,490
how they look when we break them out per

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,050
age group here we look at some of these

11
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:27,149
examples but this is a good kind of

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,039
reference slide to be to understand the

13
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,439
different types of population pyramids

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,058
that to exist so starting with the

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
basics well population pyramid is the

16
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,919
total population divided into about five

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,109
year age groups the percentage of people

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,000
in each of those age groups is presented

19
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,308
and the percentage of males and females

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,859
in each age group is shown in a very

21
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:48,209
clean and distinctive manner the shape

22
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:50,308
of the pyramids is controlled by the

23
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,070
rate of first rate of deaths or

24
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:55,128
migration again this kind of shows just

25
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,198
those examples again of expanding

26
00:00:55,128 --> 00:01:00,869
stationary and contracting populations

27
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:04,530
evidence of expanding or high birth rate

28
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:06,629
rapid fall in each upward age group due

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,118
to high death rates here with a very

30
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:10,489
short life expectancy we're look at some

31
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:15,030
of these in more detail with some

32
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:17,280
countries as specific examples so first

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,439
off let's look at the general shapes

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,810
that we're going to deal with well in

35
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,919
expanding shape is going to have this

36
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,700
kind of triangular appearance here

37
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,099
stationary is going to be kind of block

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,659
shape and negative contraction is going

39
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,819
to be a triangle with a point in the

40
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,759
downward direction I'll be contracting

41
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,699
this would be expanding in contrast to

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,959
that so what is this population pyramid

43
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,368
what this kind of look like well let's

44
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,399
take a look at this one here so just a

45
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:46,890
mock example we see the male's here on

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,170
the Left females here on the right we

47
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,629
see the age groups here down the middle

48
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,719
then we have our populations broken out

49
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:58,500
in the millions just be 13 million 26 39

50
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,810
52 and 65 million and that be for males

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,069
and females there are three little

52
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:08,098
subsets here this age group of 60 and

53
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:10,679
older is considered elderly dependents

54
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,598
then we have our working population

55
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,818
which is about age 15 to 8 59

56
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,828
and then we have our young dependents

57
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:20,498
here so these are the young ones that

58
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:23,019
are too young to start working the main

59
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:25,479
core working population in the elds

60
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:27,879
elderly dependents that are depending on

61
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,968
that working cat population there for

62
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:33,250
the most part now populations age

63
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:36,549
structure and sex ratio can be used to

64
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,829
assess its demographic trends as we see

65
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:43,120
here was Christmas Island and over here

66
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:45,760
we see a large portion of males compared

67
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,329
to females in particular a very large

68
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:53,198
population in the male's of the age 25

69
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:55,209
to 29 so this gives us an idea of the

70
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,280
demographics of this particular island

71
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:00,729
we see that very evident here of this

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,378
with this population pyramid now

73
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:04,598
triangle shaped pyramid the expanding

74
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:07,870
pyramid is Kenya here expand it's a very

75
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:09,968
large base and we see a very small kind

76
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,269
of up towards the top here growth fates

77
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:17,560
are slow life and with a very short life

78
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:20,289
expectancy sadly in this country this

79
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,680
expanding pyramid shape is broad-based

80
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:26,258
with high birth rates narrow tops there

81
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,500
is a small elderly population which

82
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:31,089
means there's a high death rate sadly a

83
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,908
portion there's a large portion of you

84
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:37,449
young people and it's a high young

85
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:39,250
dependency or ratio the sex ratio this

86
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:41,229
bounce pyramid there's a balanced sex

87
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,560
ratio from males to females it's not

88
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:46,829
favoring any one particular gender then

89
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,919
expanding pyramid in contrast to that

90
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:52,719
see expanding pyramid is expansive this

91
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:55,359
population pyramids have the classic

92
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,709
triangular shape looks and how this

93
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:59,229
one's a little bit different than the

94
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,269
previous one that we saw it has a wide

95
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:03,519
base like we saw it the other one which

96
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,199
indicates a high birthrate and a narrow

97
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,780
topic negates a high death rate but we

98
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:11,229
see there's deeper into the population

99
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,209
here with a greater population generally

100
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:15,069
speaking an expanding population is

101
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,889
characteristics of low standards of

102
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:20,529
living high birthrate do the poor access

103
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,699
to birth control lack of education and

104
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,969
so on

105
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:27,819
in a high death rate due to poor medical

106
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,640
care or potentially nutrition see that

107
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:34,149
here was Syria and Haiti so we see a

108
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,000
large populations kind of that 29 and

109
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:39,279
under but then it decreases rapidly as

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,430
that population of individuals within

111
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,809
that population age a negative growth

112
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,209
pyramid well this is a shrinking

113
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,930
population there's a long life

114
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:52,149
expectancy for Italy here we see this

115
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,040
negative growth meaning there's not as

116
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:59,589
many young people as they are that

117
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:02,560
working-class as ever best older so

118
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:04,539
Greece we see that same negative growth

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,530
pyramid and that's evident by the narrow

120
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,770
base that occurs which shows a low birth

121
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:13,359
rate which is a decrease in population

122
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:15,759
of a portion a large portion of the

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,990
working population at 15 to 59 year old

124
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,719
see that's the majority of that

125
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,220
population there and the sex ratio again

126
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,380
is a balanced pyramid so there's an

127
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,110
equal balance between females and males

128
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:28,000
in this case between a negative growth

129
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,660
pyramid will be evident of Italy or in

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,689
this case Greece this negative growth

131
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,600
population is a population period have

132
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:40,569
narrower base than the reproductive age

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,640
population this indicates a decreasing

134
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,409
population trend and the low birthrate

135
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,990
is indicative of a well developed

136
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,910
country so just we saw with Italy in

137
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,550
Greece we see the same thing going on

138
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,220
here with Germany now male to female

139
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:58,000
ratio is also pretty equal but this is a

140
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,950
negative growth population pyramid now

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,160
is stable pyramid has low infant

142
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:05,920
mortality is low population growth and a

143
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,780
long life expectancy we say it's stable

144
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,759
it's pretty much consistent throughout

145
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:13,179
as I have been consistent the whole way

146
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,389
we have to keep in mind is just based on

147
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,220
you know normal human activity people

148
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,159
are not going to live to be 100 plus the

149
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,830
same portion of population and it's

150
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,660
going to be the age 50 to 54 so there's

151
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:30,490
gonna be a natural progression downward

152
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:32,920
we see pretty much from age 65 to 69

153
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,439
here all the way down at Basin being

154
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,840
born pretty stable

155
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,370
population overall and this is a

156
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,889
rectangular shape or zero population

157
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:45,530
growth it's a narrow base so there's low

158
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:48,469
birth rates the life expecting is high

159
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:51,349
in these stable populations this is

160
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,560
about 80 plus years is the expected life

161
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:57,590
expectancy low death rates and this is a

162
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,589
stable population bars of equal length

163
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:02,599
and there's a balanced proportion here

164
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:05,779
the sex ratio is also balanced now we

165
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,300
may see that in this case in Denmark age

166
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:10,309
30 the 34 is a little bit less but

167
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,009
overall we're kind of looking at general

168
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:17,000
trends here that is stable population

169
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:18,980
pyramids have a vase similar to the

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,379
width of the population of the

171
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,900
reproductive ages which indicates a

172
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:26,089
stable population generally speaking

173
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:28,429
these stable populations in this example

174
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:30,919
here Aruba are characteristics of a

175
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,780
high-standard living this high standard

176
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,210
of living is due to low birthrate

177
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,009
I do two good family planning that

178
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,959
access to birth control financial

179
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,480
planning and education overall the

180
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,269
country it's a low death rate due to

181
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,370
good medical care nutrition in education

182
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:48,859
they said before we can't have it a

183
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:52,819
complete box but life expectancy of

184
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,939
about 80 years old orient in this case

185
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:58,730
over seventy is just indicative of good

186
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:00,769
stable population again we see the

187
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:04,540
bounce or sex ratio between males and

188
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:08,839
females very equal and Aruba here 2015

189
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:11,950
is showing a prime example of a stable

190
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,949
population pyramid
