1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,440
going to go out in the greenhouse and

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,800
we're going to show you how to recognize

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,638
a nitrogen deficiency in cannabis plants

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,320
now to correct this nitrogen deficiency

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:13,759
if you wanted one of the pure nitrogen

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,919
fertilizers

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,679
urea calcium nitrate or blood meal would

9
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,198
be great options there's other videos on

10
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,439
that within this channel as well as how

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,359
to calculate 100 parts per million to

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,800
feed your plants but this just shows

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,359
when you get a little bit on the skinny

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,359
side on nitrogen what the plant response

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,800
will be so you can recognize it quickly

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,800
and make corrections

17
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,800

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,238
okay so after looking at these plants

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,640
here we can notice there is some

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,599
yellowing of those lower leaves and this

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,159
is characteristic of a nitrogen

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,640
deficiency you can see how

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,479
yellowing those lower leaves get the

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,558
newer upper growth stays green because

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,000
nitrogen is a mobile nutrient so when

26
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,079
we're looking at a plant and see those

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,238
lower leaves kind of get that yellow to

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,079
that limey green coloration that's the

29
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,399
sign we've got a mobile nutrient issue

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,560
those older leaves are sacrificing their

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,478
nutrients for the lush newer growth so

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,560
this is a good sign or an indication we

33
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,000
need to up our nitrogen fertilizer for

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,840
these plants

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,478
again as we can see here those lower

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,478
leaves get that yellowy to almost brown

37
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,640
but that newer upper growth maintains

38
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,239
that nice lush green growth which is

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,239
what we want to see that's simply that

40
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,640
nitrogen moving from the older leaves to

41
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,319
that newer leaves a good indication that

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,799
nitrogen fertilizer is a little bit

43
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,078
lacking in this particular grow so

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,840
they're upping their fertilizer and that

45
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,959
should help correct the problem

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,560
the

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,879
leaves that are this severe and

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
yellowing probably will not re-green but

49
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,839
those that are more of the limey green

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,680
color

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,520
compared to the darker green color so

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,040
this kind of this type of

53
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,719
lighter green compared to this green

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
those have a chance at greening out

55
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,640
that's saying they will but hopefully

56
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,798
will stop the progression of any more

57
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,560
yellowing throughout that plant and

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,960
throughout the other plants in this

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,960
entire greenhouse
