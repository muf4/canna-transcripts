1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,569
as the title implies I'm going to be

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,699
going over transplanting which is a

3
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:09,150
critical step especially when we're

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,740
growing container grown crops so how and

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,269
when to transplant well once the clone

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,160
is filled its containing want to remove

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,170
it and plant it into a larger container

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,359
and that can vary depending on the size

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,400
container it originated in here's one it

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,810
originated in a very small plug well

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,339
what are the clone flip the container

12
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,709
upside out and place it into a premade

13
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,028
hole into the larger container be sure

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,769
to water everything in and keep it under

15
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:30,750
constant conditions to reduce plant

16
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,549
shock plants that are transported late

17
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,229
will become pot bound so it's got a

18
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,019
little bit of it timing then I don't

19
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:38,339
want to wait too long or go too early

20
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,809
this would be one of one of them want to

21
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,559
go much longer than that just looking at

22
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:45,659
the amount of roots in this plug

23
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,189
suggestion container size so typically 3

24
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,229
gallon pots and $10 hot or what's

25
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:51,030
commonly used 3 gallon pots we typically

26
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,919
recommend for plants up to about 3 feet

27
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,100
tall and revise your plans that are two

28
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,660
to three months old 7 gallon containers

29
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,760
can hold a plant for its full term

30
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,439
awesome it will prefer 10 gallon

31
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,960
containers and hold a plant for over a

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,728
year to some extent when you get into

33
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,739
like 7 or 10 gallon pots it comes down

34
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,510
to personal preference some growers

35
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,819
really like the 10 some other like the 7

36
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,100
so we're transitioning from one to

37
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,919
another or trying different sizes so

38
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:21,239
there's no quotes at 1 gallon pot size

39
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,400
that will work in all instances when

40
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,079
selecting our container size it's

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,969
debated but larger containers use more

42
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,618
media and are often more forgiving and

43
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,228
can reduce clinic stresses so that's one

44
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,060
advantage sometimes specific variety

45
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:34,950
have it can dictate what size containers

46
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,329
use at the image here there's always

47
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,530
kind of pros and cons you kinda gotta

48
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:39,089
weigh each side

49
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,849
bigger containers are more forgiving

50
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,978
with these more media so again whatever

51
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,199
fits your condition people grown great

52
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:50,039
plants in a variety of sizes of

53
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,359
containers the container material that

54
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,790
was interesting in general there's solid

55
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,159
wall there's breathable materials solid

56
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,140
walls reduce water loss of it can cause

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,420
roots to kind of circle breathable

58
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,420
materials such as grow bags or in this

59
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,189
case we have the slats cut in here can

60
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,960
cause root pruning which helps create a

61
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,848
dense root ball without the plant

62
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,549
getting root bound is called kind of air

63
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,229
pruning that occurs so again both of

64
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,980
these in this case the same size or

65
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:18,000
gallons

66
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:20,340
but very different methods and we have

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,098
to consider both options and figure out

68
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,959
what works best when transplanting

69
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:26,818
during transplant process good tempt

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,189
inoculate roots if you choose to do so

71
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,049
since it's typically a good amount of

72
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,030
root surface area to come in contact

73
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,950
with applied products yet not a

74
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,439
requirement but can allow for a very

75
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:38,729
efficient transfer of that plants can

76
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,560
also be watered in with low dose

77
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:42,030
fertilizers at this time we don't really

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,068
want to go with high dose because of

79
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,860
those freshly exposed roots you have the

80
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:48,929
chance of burning them grown juice

81
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,640
reprinting wool I cut the roots well can

82
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,409
help restart plant has become pop down

83
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,419
it's something that's really did sink

84
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,280
that pop and go through and cut some of

85
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,559
these roots help rejuvenate the plant

86
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,180
kind of get it back going this may

87
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,489
encourage to start growing again even

88
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,930
it's kept in the same size container to

89
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,340
take the plant out cut some of the roots

90
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,260
and put it right back in the same sized

91
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,269
container because the root mass has been

92
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,598
reduced causing that kind of tricking

93
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,340
the plant that kind of rejuvenate itself

94
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,719
proper media fill height so girls often

95
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,069
want to fill the pot to the very top

96
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,039
because kinda like the ice cream cone

97
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:21,659
effect this is not advised and kind of

98
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,280
see this in this instance where the

99
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,680
potting main is right up to the size of

100
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,739
the container what about this 2 to 3

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,750
inch gap to the lip to the soil line

102
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,879
this allows you to combine hand water

103
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,949
very easily and church all of medium

104
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,870
remains in the container if you fill the

105
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,399
medium high it's gonna only produce the

106
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,739
cleanest of conditions but can lead to

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,049
irrigation issues with increased size of

108
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,750
runoff coral tration and mediating on

109
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:47,250
the floor causing a great habitat for

110
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,310
potential unwanted organisms to view

111
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,329
living when a fill and not pack the

112
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,769
media is a lot of times people go

113
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,569
through and pack in the media and make

114
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,939
it really dense I want to keep some

115
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,708
porosity to it I don't really want to

116
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,348
press it all down and squeeze out all

117
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,150
the air not sure where Brewers think all

118
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:04,888
the media is gonna escape to but packing

119
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,209
media will reduce air infiltration and

120
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,889
make it harder for their roots to

121
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,379
breathe keep in mind the roots light

122
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,389
gauzy to exchange oxygen remember to

123
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,680
perspire just like you do so suffocating

124
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:15,989
them is not advised that they need

125
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,150
oxygen dance lobby but to squeeze out

126
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,608
all that moisture and all that kind of

127
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,679
air pockets also place the cut again you

128
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,598
can pack it in very lightly but keep in

129
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,788
mind the whole point if they have some

130
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,779
sort of air in that container in that

131
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:31,009
media too

132
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:31,009
allow the roots to breathe
