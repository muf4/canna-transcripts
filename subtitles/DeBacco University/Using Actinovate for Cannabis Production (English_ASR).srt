1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
interested in learning more about

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,200
actinovate this debaco university video

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,120
is for you

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:17,118
to see how it may apply to your given

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:18,719
growing situation

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,480
all right let's go over using actinovate

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,000
for cannabis production

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,240
so first off should define what

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,198
actinovate is and activates a biological

10
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,079
fungicide

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,720
with this streptomyces active ingredient

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,159
what is this

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,159
this is a naturally occurring soil

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,960
bacterium that was originally isolated

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,439
from the roots

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,960
of linseed plants in england and

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,479
patented worldwide

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,079
it has been shown effectiveness in both

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,238
indoors and outdoors

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,039
in a variety of growing situations we're

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:45,759
going to look at some studies

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,238
specifically looking at this product

23
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,039
so the study here i can look at it in

24
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:50,479
more detail

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
this is the evaluation of disease

26
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,439
management approaches for powdery mildew

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,159
and cannabis

28
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,280
plants looking at actinovate as well as

29
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,639
a couple other things

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,439
if you want to look at the study in more

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,840
detail so what are the specifics of

32
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,798
this study well paramill divine cannabis

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
is caused by

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,960
a particular fungus it's a fungus that

35
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
might be different so keep in mind that

36
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,079
there are different versions of powdery

37
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,400
mildew even though common name

38
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,280
they're all the same powdery mildew of

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,799
squash

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,719
is different than powdery mildew that

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,600
affects uh for example

42
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,759
like your bee bombs or your for example

43
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,000
powdery mildew that affects your lilacs

44
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,200
there's different variants within the

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,879
powdery mildew

46
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,880
so to investigate disease management

47
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,640
options biological chemical and physical

48
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,118
approaches were assessed

49
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,200
a patternability susceptible strain was

50
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,799
grown indoors with continuous exposure

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,719
to powdery mildew inoculum

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,079
to really test the effectiveness of this

53
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,599
product

54
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,759
so here's the data looking at the

55
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,640
control which is basically an unsprayed

56
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,118
control

57
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
xero tol is basically like a hydrogen

58
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,959
peroxide

59
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,280
natural fungicide bacteriocyte and then

60
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,559
activate to see how it compares

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,159
overall we can see the trends are

62
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,000
that while the control had the highest

63
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,799
levels as would be expected

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,200
xerotal had the lowest levels inactivate

65
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,600
fell

66
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,878
somewhere in between sometimes not

67
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,000
statistically different

68
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,598
sometimes statistically different so

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
what are other what is other research

70
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:15,199
shown

71
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,879
regarding this product and there's

72
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,359
different forms of activity ag is

73
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,519
considered to be the agricultural type

74
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,920
well previous research has shown that of

75
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
ag to be effective at reducing powdery

76
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,958
mildew disease severity compared to

77
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,800
unsprayed controls

78
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,319
but it was ineffective compared to water

79
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,239
control on grape

80
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,759
and compared to both water and unsprayed

81
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,878
treatments it was ineffective at lung

82
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,079
disease incidents

83
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,399
so again we have to take this into

84
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,319
consideration on squash and cantaloupe

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,840
actinib alone was not found to reduce

86
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,039
powdery mildew severity compared to the

87
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,878
water control

88
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,719
and the efficacy of actinovate is most

89
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,639
likely due to the antibiotic

90
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,479
and kinase production by the

91
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,559
streptomyces as well as

92
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,759
induction of plant defenses following

93
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,199
the application

94
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,120
however in this study activate did not

95
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,639
provide significant disease reduction

96
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,239
it is not currently registered as

97
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,518
disease control and

98
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,280
on cannabis within canada

99
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,959
so activity applied to candidates for

100
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,199
powdering mildew control

101
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,039
uh however in the study activity did not

102
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,639
provide significant disease reduction

103
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,959
and it's not currently registered as

104
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,119
disease control in cannabis in canada

105
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
therefore its likelihood of being used

106
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,000
or its

107
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,679
suggestion to be used is definitely

108
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,479
reduced based on the data

109
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
as well as the current registration

110
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,840
restrictions

111
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,719
in given areas so again it's important

112
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,000
to do this study

113
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,158
to determine if the products you're

114
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,598
adding are actually worthwhile are

115
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,079
actually able to reach significantly

116
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,399
reduce

117
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
disease to prove that they're worth the

118
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,000
investment in time

119
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,439
to go through and apply them so look

120
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,878
more at specifics of the study they did

121
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,560
look at some other products

122
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,039
they did they do have the materials and

123
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,799
methods listed so this is just one part

124
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,679
of the research to become an educated

125
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,680
grower
