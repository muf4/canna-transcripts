1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,600
here on tobacco university i'm going to

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,160
cover

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,599
a controller that has fuzzy logic and

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,359
some things you should know about it and

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:17,920
how you should best utilize it

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:17,920
in your growing space

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,480
all right let's get into carbon dioxide

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,600
controller with fuzzy logic for cannabis

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,359
production

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,439
so first off probably important to know

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,039
is just simply what is fuzzy logic and

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,278
kind of we use this term

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,920
well what does it actually mean well

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,079
this fuzzy logic is an internal program

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
that utilizes dosing duration and

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,920
changes in carbon dioxide levels to

17
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,799
calculate how to most efficiently

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
maintain the preset target level of

19
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,159
carbon dioxide

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,199
the goal is for the controller to not

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,319
largely over

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,719
or under dose from the target present

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,079
preset level here's the here's kind of a

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,640
graphical analysis of what this looks

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,558
like

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,480
well initially we may have some dosing

27
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,839
that occurs and it overshoots and goes

28
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,718
below and overshoots and kind of goes

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,120
through this

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
however when we implement fuzzy logic we

31
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,519
can see that the

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,840
swings in the total duration

33
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,118
that spins over or below the setpoint

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,200
start to get reduced

35
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,640
over time this is the controller

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,400
learning the conditions

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,400
learning the growing area learning the

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,880
rate of dosing and getting more dialed

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,560
in

40
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,158
you also notice that the frequency uh

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,200
tends to increase little short durations

42
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,799
little pulses

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,000
can be a great way for that controller

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,680
to learn your growth space and to

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,438
efficiently dose with carbon dioxide

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,600
so what are the limitations of this

47
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,118
fuzzy logic these gradual adjustments

48
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,640
that you see are specific to the growth

49
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,959
space and make these controllers very

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,320
efficient at delivering carbon dioxide

51
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,000
and this is why you typically pay a

52
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,118
little bit more for these this can

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,438
reduce the

54
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,438
potential for wasting carbon dioxide and

55
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,478
limit the number of bottle changes that

56
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,559
needs to be made

57
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,478
while still maintaining near target

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,240
levels of carbon dioxide enrichment

59
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,920
so not only are you extending the life

60
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,039
of your bottle you're also maintaining

61
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,040
the conditions

62
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,118
closer to that preset target that you've

63
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,840
set however this cannot be used with

64
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,159
carboxy

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
generators it only works with bottle or

66
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,239
liquid fed

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,920
systems generators are only on and off

68
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
and unlike the pulse dosing that can

69
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,919
occur with the compressed tink

70
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,360
of carbon dioxide and we can see example

71
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,479
of that here the pulse dosing some are

72
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
longer some are shorter

73
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,919
and it's basically the controller

74
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
dialing in and making sure it's staying

75
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,878
within that target range

76
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,879
ideally staying within the dead band

77
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,199
that you've set which is the amount of

78
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,239
tolerance you have to be above or below

79
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,439
your actual set point so how do we set

80
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
that deadband

81
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,959
let me set that kind of target level

82
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,399
above or below this setting decides how

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
tight you want the controller to keep

84
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,519
carbon dioxide levels to the target set

85
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,959
point

86
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,959
essentially how far the controller will

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,400
allow the carbon axles to deviate

88
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,000
from the chosen setting before

89
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,879
triggering carbon dioxide's

90
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,800
source to switch on or off the default

91
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,518
for most systems is around 50 parts per

92
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,120
million

93
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,640
for most controllers and this is a good

94
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,800
general setting for bottle based

95
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,399
systems selecting 50 parts per million

96
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,280
as your deadband setting will allow your

97
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,039
growth space

98
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,400
levels to be over or below by 50 parts

99
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,479
per million before the controller were

100
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,840
turned on or off the dosing

101
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,199
other growers wanted something a little

102
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,120
bit tighter we can see this one set here

103
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,238
to be 25 parts per million

104
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,439
you don't want to set it too tight

105
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,719
because otherwise the controller will

106
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,359
struggle to kind of keep it within that

107
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,560
range

108
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
you don't want it too large because you

109
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,840
know large swings so 50 is usually the

110
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
starting point

111
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,439
feeling is going good you can adjust it

112
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,599
from there

113
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,479
make sure your sensor for whatever

114
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,039
system you're using

115
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,158
has the presence of a photocell why do

116
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,359
you want a photocell

117
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,359
well this will help ensure that the

118
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,200
carbon dioxide is only added

119
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,760
during the light period which is only

120
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,719
when the plants can actually utilize it

121
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,239
a time could be used if you have a

122
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,318
regiment light schedule

123
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,080
but photocells generally a fail-safe

124
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,280
option to ensure carbon dioxide is only

125
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,280
added when plants

126
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,438
can use it some of these simpsons have

127
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,438
like an on off time that you could set

128
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,878
but really most manufacturers now are

129
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,039
going over to photocells so

130
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,399
you adjust the light duration if you're

131
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,759
in indoor growing

132
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
this carbon dioxide system will

133
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,359
automatically adjust to that also if

134
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,239
you're growing in an outdoor location or

135
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,239
cold frame

136
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
the photocell can adjust to the either

137
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,640
lengthening or decreasing duration

138
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,039
of sunlight that you might be getting

139
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,719
based on seasonal changes

140
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,039
lastly what can this system do it can

141
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,400
maximize the yield of cannabis

142
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,319
over the course of a growing cycle

143
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,799
canvas plants will become many times

144
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,719
larger

145
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,560
and as a result having a controller that

146
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,720
will adjust to these conditions

147
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,240
will automatically ensures efficiency as

148
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,680
those plants get larger

149
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,680
carbon dioxide consumption could

150
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,439
increase and having this fuzzy logic can

151
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,879
help again maintain those levels

152
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,478
despite these changes that might be

153
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:43,839
occurring to ensure

154
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,839
you have a very efficient grow operation
