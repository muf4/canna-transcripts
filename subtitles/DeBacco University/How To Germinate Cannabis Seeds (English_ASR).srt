1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,000
so this video in debaco university i'm

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,200
going to go over how to germinate

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,200
cannabis seeds

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,638
what's the proper method rising some

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:15,929
do's some don'ts

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:18,879
here on debaco university

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,039
[Music]

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,399
all right let's get into the information

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,679
here on how to best germinate your

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,079
cannabis seeds

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,239
well keep in mind that seeds are dormant

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,598
so seeds are nature's way

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,678
for offspring to wait for ideal

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,520
conditions to take place before

15
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,159
initiating the grow cycle

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,760
canvas seeds typically only have uh

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,799
about nine percent moisture

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,718
uh typically sun drying is is practiced

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,959
or as low as five percent or even less

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,039
while dormant with minimal respiration

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
and the lower that moisture content the

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,280
longer

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,439
you're going to be able to germinate

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,239
those or keep them stored and still have

25
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,479
high germination numbers so the

26
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,878
germination process of a seed there's a

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,398
lot that goes on when a seed initiates

28
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,238
the germination process

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,359
first off absorption of water stimulates

30
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:04,878
the germination process that's the

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,879
initiator to the event

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,400
the embryo will synthesize gibberellin

33
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,679
it's a plant hormone in response to

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,320
water uptake

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,479
there's a protein layer that synthesizes

36
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,599
mlas which is an enzyme in response to

37
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,679
the gibberellin

38
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,599
so sometimes people add you'll hear

39
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,439
people adding gibberellic acid

40
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,039
for older seeds help encourage the

41
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,798
germination in the sense they're trying

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,560
to push that step along that would

43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,640
normally be initiated by the water

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,320
and kind of causes cascading event to

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,519
occur the amylase

46
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,279
mobilizes energy reserves in hydrolysis

47
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,078
starch to maltose means it breaks it

48
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,239
apart

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,078
maltose is converted to glucose and

50
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,000
respired to release atp

51
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,199
which is the energy source and that

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,159
initial energy source

53
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
it's going to cause the kind of

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,960
formation and pushing out of the radical

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,799
or root

56
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,239
and then the sheet is going to grow up

57
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,280
or in the upward direction it'll be

58
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,839
break through the soil

59
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,879
to start to absorb the sun there and

60
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,920
produce its own

61
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,118
sugars so consistency is important when

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,600
we're looking at germinating

63
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,438
seeds we want to be mindful of the

64
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,359
conditions we have our plants growing in

65
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,199
and try to keep them as consistent as

66
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,318
possible once the environmental

67
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,920
conditions uh

68
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,759
ranges are determined it's critical

69
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,119
they're maintained for the duration of

70
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,399
germination process that can always be

71
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,200
exactly the same but as long as we know

72
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
the range

73
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,479
we're not exceeding or that above or

74
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,039
below that will help

75
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,598
vastly increase your consistency and

76
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,280
your percent germination

77
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,839
as always you want to start with quality

78
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,439
seeds so this is the start for any

79
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,159
chance that a good germination or

80
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,560
emergence

81
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,878
rate getting seeds from a source that

82
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,319
also provides a coa certificate often

83
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:41,039
authenticity can be well worth it

84
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,759
that's important for knowing what seeds

85
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,439
that you're

86
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,598
getting there's also stand for a

87
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,439
certificate of analysis as well

88
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,878
keep in mind that while this image right

89
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,959
here shows a nice

90
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,878
seed pack this is not an official form

91
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
of documentation

92
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:56,159
this over here this kind of black and

93
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,318
white kind of simulink boring one

94
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,359
is can be a more official form of

95
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,359
documentation

96
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,959
and any person you're purchasing or

97
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
company you're purchasing seeds from

98
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,959
should be able to supply with that upon

99
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,399
request now the temperature you're

100
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,239
looking at what should you germinate

101
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,158
your season what temperature

102
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,599
above 90 degrees fahrenheit or above 30

103
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,280
degrees celsius will kill the seeds

104
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,119
we'll render them basically denature the

105
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,400
proteins and basically kill them

106
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
so what's the ideal germination

107
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
temperature you're looking at generally

108
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,239
that 78 degrees fahrenheit to 82 degrees

109
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,439
fahrenheit 25 to 28 degrees celsius is a

110
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,080
good starting point

111
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,959
um there that will allow for efficient

112
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
or hopefully

113
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,039
high germination rates for the moisture

114
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,719
level you're looking at about a 90

115
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,719
relative humidity and that can be

116
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,560
achieved in many ways through misters or

117
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,878
humidity domes or even just plastic bags

118
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,039
over

119
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,639
little cups here for seedlings that's

120
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,359
also very important here to maintain a

121
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,238
very high

122
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,879
relative humidity keep in mind seeds

123
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,719
also need

124
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,719
it to breathe so remember they're

125
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,479
respiring they're taking in oxygen

126
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,400
so there should be some air pockets no

127
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,079
matter what substrate you're using

128
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
to prevent seeds from drowning in water

129
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,599
we want them constantly soaking in water

130
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,199
and basically drowning in water

131
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,438
we do want them to have at least 10

132
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,000
percent air to allow that respiration

133
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,519
process

134
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,519
to occur now planting depth

135
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,039
can vary slightly typically you're

136
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,719
looking at an eighth to a quarter of an

137
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,318
inch which is about three millimeters to

138
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,919
six millimeters deep

139
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,918
many different ways to measure the key

140
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,439
is consistency and having a tool to

141
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,879
speed up the process

142
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,879
here can be a little dowel with just a

143
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,879
little marker on it to know exactly how

144
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,879
far to place that seed down

145
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,478
in the germination media that you're

146
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,600
choosing to use

147
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,039
now for light for um seedlings so

148
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,879
it doesn't matter to say the light

149
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,479
source but we're looking at kind of

150
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,159
uh what's the intensity of that it's the

151
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,399
par reading to being 150 to 300 um

152
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,479
micro moles is what um suggested and

153
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,239
remember ppfd stands for photosynthetic

154
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,399
photon flux density

155
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,240
pars typically what might be heard of in

156
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,719
the literature that's photosynthetic

157
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
active

158
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,639
radiation while not needed for the

159
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,280
germination process it's a good idea to

160
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,960
have this

161
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,799
light source over the plants upon

162
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,399
emergence so the seasons can immediately

163
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
start the photosynthetic process you

164
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,638
want to see that emerges and there's no

165
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,918
light

166
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,840
and then they can start stretching and

167
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,439
causing other issues keep the light

168
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,478
diffused to avoid burning newly emerged

169
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,240
seedlings

170
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,918
and then you can slowly work its way up

171
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,800
especially if you're going to an outdoor

172
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:16,478
environment now some growers recommend

173
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,360
or talk about well should i be soaking

174
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,800
my seeds

175
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,280
should i take my seeds and kind of like

176
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,720
put them in water for a duration of time

177
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,399
well for the most part some growers will

178
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,080
put seeds in the water

179
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,679
before that you know for a predetermined

180
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,800
soak time others will go straight into

181
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,959
planting them

182
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,960
a short soak and let's say short two to

183
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,680
maybe four hours is a good idea as this

184
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,758
will help

185
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,720
water infiltration and also allow the

186
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,560
growers to cull out

187
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,479
seeds that float that might not be fully

188
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
developed floating seeds often have

189
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,399
those air pockets in there now

190
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,199
poorly developed endosperm which will

191
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,279
directly

192
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,639
reduce germination or emergence rate so

193
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,079
sometimes it's a good idea to

194
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,680
maybe soak them for a little bit to see

195
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,038
which ones float which ones have that

196
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,319
kind of hollow appearance

197
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:58,478
and cull those out very early now plain

198
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,560
water or treated waters as often

199
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,519
growers will ask seeds should just be

200
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
soaked in clean

201
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,038
just regular water there's no need to

202
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,399
add fertilizers even if small amounts

203
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,478
there's no need

204
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,079
to the soaking water someone may add

205
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:10,879
kelp to help provide a small amount of

206
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,599
hormones

207
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,959
if older or poorly stored seedlings

208
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,639
seeds are being used

209
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,318
but again even that necessary isn't

210
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,160
necessary just plain water

211
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,680
is all the seeds need to initiate this

212
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,919
process

213
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,600
now this summary of those cannabis seed

214
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,279
germination processes always start with

215
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,360
quality c they have a coa

216
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,959
i give the temperature the humidity or

217
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,600
moisture levels i should say

218
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,000
the air should be about 10 air the

219
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,479
planting

220
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
depth the light and water should be

221
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:41,038
filtered or at least

222
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,240
drinkable water there now what i

223
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,399
recommend you don't do

224
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,319
or try to avoid is starting your seeds

225
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,399
in paper towels to start the seeds

226
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,080
for later transfer into whatever media

227
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,679
this is a poor idea due the increased

228
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,399
likelihood of damage to the fragile

229
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,560
radical

230
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,159
it can get caught in the paper towel you

231
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,439
might miss them

232
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,439
they're very small seeds they're very

233
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,079
fragile seeds it's just something that

234
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,879
is not

235
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,399
advised maybe from germany larger seeds

236
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,120
potentially but definitely for cannabis

237
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,719
seeds

238
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,038
not really advised to start in paper

239
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,960
towel even though many growers do that

240
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,560
what i do recommend is i'll show here in

241
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,638
a short video clip is kind of what you

242
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,519
would see kind of at a large scale

243
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,280
tray system using oasis so let's take a

244
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,279
look at that now

245
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,318
so here we're looking at a bowl of

246
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,000
quality uh

247
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,479
cannabis seeds or that nice dark

248
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,160
coloration you can see the area all set

249
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,478
up you see the trays we see

250
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,360
the oasis we see the dibble we see a fan

251
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,359
to keep the

252
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,879
planter happy and this is a great way to

253
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,400
be efficient with this process

254
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,639
all right as we saw there kind of at the

255
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,560
large scale once you go through that

256
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
process well how long will it take

257
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,918
well germination typically you're

258
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,159
looking at two to seven days emergence

259
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,719
can be expected about three to ten days

260
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,280
quality seeds in conditioned conditions

261
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
and this

262
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,519
stated range will fall in the lower end

263
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,719
of the expected range

264
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,639
so here's just an example of a

265
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,800
collection of ceilings here

266
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,639
15 days from the initial seed soaking

267
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,759
time and this just again shows you what

268
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,598
you can hopefully

269
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,038
expect to see in that three to ten days

270
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,878
now where will you germinate your seeds

271
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,399
this is an important consideration

272
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,639
uh will you be using you know while

273
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,959
general germination process is the same

274
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,240
what do you intend to place the seeds in

275
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,079
when and

276
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,439
different substrates will have different

277
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,159
uh specifics that you should be

278
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,839
following

279
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,840
so for example rock wool is favorable

280
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,439
for seed germination but disposal of

281
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,359
that material can be an issue

282
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,000
soilless media is easy to get but can be

283
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,439
very messy direct seedling is requires

284
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,958
no need for transplant but needs

285
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,120
specialized equipment particularly going

286
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,879
into a field or soil based area

287
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,719
so when looking at these options when

288
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,799
you're considering germinating seeds

289
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,479
which growing substrate would you select

290
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,639
no matter which one you select

291
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,720
search for that video on this channel

292
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,439
and you'll find more details

293
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,440
for your selected growing media to help

294
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,200
increase your odds of success

295
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,200
with your cannabis seedlings
