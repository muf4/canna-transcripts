1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,650
okay here we're ELCA feedback loops and

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:06,689
how they relate to the body so while

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,940
this initial example here looks at kind

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,679
of like an engineering standpoint I kind

5
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,018
of like the suggestion of the infinity

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,580
sign because riccati is constant going

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,670
back and forth trying to maintain

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,929
homeostasis and that's exactly what's

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,000
kind of going on here with feedback

10
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,800
loops there's a way to kind of raise

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,960
something it can be away also to low or

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,810
something we're gonna look at two

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,890
specific types of feedback loops here so

14
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,439
showing with the first one we call a

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,960
negative feedback loop this has a

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,058
response that is reverse of the change

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,739
that's detected so an example be

18
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:40,349
thermoregulation in blood sugar

19
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,328
regulation look here at low body

20
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,100
temperature so we have our normal body

21
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,070
temperature the body temperature

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,469
decreases well what's gonna cause

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,570
through a negative feedback loop it's

24
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,760
advised going to shiver and it's gonna

25
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,710
cause an increase in the body

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,170
temperature now that body temperature

27
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,969
increases too much well then we're gonna

28
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,379
have the negative which is basically the

29
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,058
opposite effect we have cooling

30
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:04,978
mechanisms such as sweating that occurs

31
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:06,989
that helped us reduce our body

32
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,390
temperature so looking at negative

33
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,399
feedback if something's decreasing then

34
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,189
we're gonna cause the loops gonna cause

35
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,930
an increase to occur and just vice-versa

36
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,658
an increase occurs we're gonna have a

37
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,670
decrease house looks a little bit more

38
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,750
complicated sense is their release of

39
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,799
adrenal cords which is to a by the

40
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,599
release of hormones from the

41
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,689
hypothalamus the pituitary gland

42
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:34,469
this is signals inhibited when the

43
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:37,349
political quarter ends levels become

44
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,959
elevated by causing negative signals on

45
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:41,158
the 2-tier and in hypothalamus so we

46
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,529
have our homeostasis we have our nice

47
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,979
happy body conditions we have an

48
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,840
imbalance that occurs here so within the

49
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,299
body there's the hypothalamus perceives

50
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,250
low blood concentrations so that's

51
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,810
causing an imbalance what that's gonna

52
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,118
relate to is a hormone to be released

53
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,700
this hormone release is going to cause a

54
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,310
cascading effect to help increase these

55
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,920
blood levels these blood is going to be

56
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,990
released in the various glands which

57
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,030
will hopefully cause a correction to

58
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:11,789
occur and that correction be evident by

59
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,710
the levels increasing in the blood these

60
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:15,659
increased levels so when the hep

61
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,540
elmo's perceives normal concentrations

62
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,250
it will stop releasing them so here

63
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,989
initially we had to release the negative

64
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,020
feedback system is now causing the

65
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:27,210
stopping or release of that resulting in

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,189
homeostasis to occur so if you've in

67
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,599
mind negative feedback is when if

68
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,060
something is going to stimulate

69
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,900
something then it also be way to kind of

70
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,370
suppress or reduce that from occurring

71
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,020
now the opposite of negative feedback as

72
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,050
you might have guessed would be a

73
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,640
positive feedback loop in this involves

74
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,270
the response that reinforces our

75
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:50,369
amplifies the change detected childbirth

76
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,200
is one example in blood clotting

77
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,259
we're only specifically here these two

78
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,539
examples show child-birthing so here's

79
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,459
the nerve impulse from the service of

80
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,799
treatment to the brain of the Biebs head

81
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,780
pushing against the cervix the brain

82
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,030
will then stimulate the pituitary gland

83
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,169
to release a hormone that hormones

84
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,810
carried into the blood stream to the

85
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,789
uterus and the students the contraction

86
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,500
of the uterus tour these cervix that

87
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,239
will then cause the baby's head to hit

88
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,610
against the cervix again causing this

89
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,960
kind of go around and around see that

90
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,660
same thing here were positive he I

91
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,010
keeping mine we're amplifying the signal

92
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,810
so stretch receptors are activated in

93
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:27,209
the uterus as the baby's growth takes up

94
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,979
larger space in the uterus this will

95
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,310
then signal the brain to release a

96
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,889
hormone oxytocin this then will cause

97
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,939
the uterine muscles to contract

98
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:37,439
contractions will get stronger until the

99
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,240
baby is delivered we have this positive

100
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,509
feedback which is kind of building our

101
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,710
amplification of this signal okay so

102
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:45,329
hopefully that gives you a little bit of

103
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:49,340
a background between negative feedback

104
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,340
loops and positive feedback loops
