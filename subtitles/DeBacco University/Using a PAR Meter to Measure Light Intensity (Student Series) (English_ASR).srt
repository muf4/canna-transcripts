00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,759
going to go over using a par meter to

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,679
measure light intensity and this is part

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,919
of our student series so i'm going to

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,000
turn over to students so you can hear

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:15,000
from them the importance of using a par

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
meter

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,399
[Music]

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
this is a par meter and we use it to

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,559
read the light intensity coming off of

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,480
our lights and onto the cannabis plants

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,518
a lot of people don't see this as an

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,278
important

14
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,879
instrument to use in their cannabis grow

15
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,039
because they simply don't understand

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,520
that especially with baby clones that

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,359
they do not require or need as much

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,719
light as the bigger ones do and

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,280
typically with lights like these you

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,280
could expect them to be a thousand volts

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,320
so using a par meter you could see

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,239
accurately how much the light will

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,198
actually be penetrating each of the

24
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:57,198
plants so you can see down here

25
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:59,039
we read at about 330 light intensity

26
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,238
which is a little high for little baby

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,600
plants but

28
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,359
regardless

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,560
up here we have over 2 000

30
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,640
a reading of over 2 000. now typically

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,359
you wouldn't want your reading to be at

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,599
300 for clones because they're tiny they

33
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,680
don't need that much light but in our

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,519
case we're using clones from outside and

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,159
outside of course the light intensity is

36
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,399
much stronger so in certain cases like

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,719
this it wouldn't necessarily matter that

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,799
it's higher but it is good to have a par

39
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:33,319
meter so that you can know just how much

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,320
light your plants are absorbing
