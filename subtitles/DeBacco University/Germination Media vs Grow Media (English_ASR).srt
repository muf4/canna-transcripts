1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
okay here we're gonna look at a very

2
00:00:01,318 --> 00:00:05,910
common question of should I get a

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,308
separate germination or propagation

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,679
media and should I get separate grow

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,268
media or can I just get one now familiar

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,400
with the germination process and what

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,710
that requires starting to recede and in

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
the girl process of the actual plant and

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,730
each of these can't have specific media

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,528
associated with that but is it worth

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,480
going through that extra staff there

12
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,059
well first off let's look at our

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,199
germination media also sometimes called

14
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,299
propagation mix

15
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,730
these are contains typically smaller

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,950
particles that help improve the soil to

17
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,629
see contact keep in mind that we need to

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,300
keep moisture levels consistent with the

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,820
seed to help increase our germination

20
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,799
rate and this is especially important

21
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,020
for smaller sized seeds this can help

22
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,549
reduce transplant shock so that's why

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,280
it's important to use a propagation mix

24
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,859
when looking at propagating or starting

25
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,329
especially small seeds in contrast to

26
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,479
that grow formulations they contain

27
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,219
larger particles they help aeration for

28
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,409
the growing of full-sized plants as we

29
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,079
see here our roots need to be able to

30
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,450
breathe even in the container here we to

31
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,819
allow this increased porosity so again

32
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,650
goes back to the question of should we

33
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,779
get specialized formulations of

34
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,368
propagation and grow media daily for

35
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,650
looking to maximize each step of the

36
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:18,989
process will yes but if we're going to

37
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,118
choose one grow formulations can be used

38
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:23,219
for propagation if there's been extra

39
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,019
careful attention at keeping the medium

40
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:27,359
moist and it may require increased

41
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,009
misting events or keeping that humidity

42
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,280
a little bit higher especially in the

43
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,599
early phases of the germination process

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,489
hopefully the answers and clarifies some

45
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,609
of the germination versus grow media's

46
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:41,060
and how each is specifically designed to

47
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:41,060
be used
