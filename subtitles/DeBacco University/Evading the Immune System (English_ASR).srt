1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
okay to go along with this unit on the

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,889
immune system I figured I should mention

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,138
two diseases that are particularly good

4
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,359
at evading the immune system and

5
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:14,699
describe just a little bit about how

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,070
they're able to go about avoiding

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:19,919
all of the systems we have in place to

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,469
hunt down and seek out and prevent and

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,600
destroy pathogens that enter our body

10
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:25,799
the first ones pride the most obvious

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,910
and when you're probably most familiar

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,320
with HIV human immunodeficiency virus

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,149
what this basically doesn't have too

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,530
great links here so you're welcome to

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,549
look at the description and click the

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,039
links directly there

17
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:39,929
they mimic antigen presenting cells by

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,530
activating the macrophage and helper

19
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:45,719
t-cells cd4 receptors so instead of an

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,500
antigen it's actually injects its own

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,879
RNA and three enzymes HIV is actually

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,480
what we call a retrovirus

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,878
it is taking RNA it's transforming it

24
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,729
into DNA incorporating it within the

25
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:04,948
macrophages T helper cells in the DNA as

26
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:07,649
a result because the HIV virus this DNA

27
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:10,530
is involved in the host cells T helper

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,930
cells it's able to hide within the

29
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,409
immune system and basically render the T

30
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,720
helper cells as they replicate basically

31
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,880
rendering them helpless inside and not

32
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,438
able to perform their function so T

33
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,000
helper cells replicate destroys the

34
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,728
cells and leaves the immune system

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,859
unable to not response up to any foreign

36
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:31,950
antigens let's forget the concept of

37
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,450
AIDS a variety of otherwise commonplace

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,409
infections prove fatal

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,170
so if you're infected with HIV it the

40
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,930
virus itself here is not what actually

41
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,329
kills you because it's essentially

42
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,040
nothing out or preventing T helper cells

43
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,798
from performing their proper function

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,350
you're more likely to die from cancer or

45
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,259
even the common cold because you lack a

46
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:58,078
functional immune system

47
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:02,688
another great theater of the immune

48
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:06,839
system is tuberculosis so specifically

49
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:08,728
Mycobacterium tuberculosis this resists

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,229
the cell destroying enzymes and

51
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,870
replicates in the macrophages of the

52
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,870
lungs in particular so when the immune

53
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,489
system finally does

54
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,390
is fine the bacterium is protected by a

55
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:21,549
thick waxy wall here has come examples

56
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,559
on what it looks like humans cells

57
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:27,099
surround the bacterium long enough

58
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,170
creating this trabeculae but does not

59
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:30,818
kill it and it's a key part there the

60
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:33,429
bacteria becomes dormant until something

61
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:35,649
acts to weaken the immune system so it

62
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,810
kind of can stay there and kind of hang

63
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,900
out for a while when the immune system

64
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,269
becomes compromised that's the time that

65
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,730
it will start to replicate again causing

66
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:47,079
a new outbreak this is why typically

67
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:49,598
people need to break your losses

68
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:52,409
screenings to be able to tell whether

69
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:55,689
they're carrying this particular

70
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:58,449
pathogen which could easily be hidden at

71
00:02:55,689 --> 00:03:01,539
times but show it cells during times of

72
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:03,189
stress so another quick short video here

73
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:05,699
a minute 41 seconds you're welcome to

74
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:08,079
take a look at regarding the CDC's

75
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:10,628
tuberculosis treatment and transmission

76
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:13,750
here so it was helpful and just giving

77
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:18,479
in to examples of diseases that exist

78
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,479
that are able to evade the immune system
