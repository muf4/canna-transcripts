1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
okay here look at different carbon

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,040
fixation pathways for what's called c3

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,059
c4 and cam plants for the most part

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,058
we've been talking about proposed

5
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:14,399
synthesis and relating to c3 plants

6
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:17,339
there's actually two other pathways that

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,670
go through however please realize each

8
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:23,129
uses carbon dioxide and ultimately all

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,330
three of these produce glucose it's how

10
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:26,368
they go about doing this that's

11
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:29,070
different the one I've been talking

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,189
about so far is the c3 plant and that's

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,130
the most simplest of forms c4 plants use

14
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,840
the bezel fill to have a four carbon

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,370
intermediate and in the calvin cycle

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,180
actually occurs in the bundle sheath

17
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:45,238
cells cam plans to have a day/night

18
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:47,640
cycle to be able to compare the two so

19
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,729
these are just things to keep in mind as

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,980
we go through and compare them so just

21
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,839
giving a little bit of orientation the

22
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,419
mesophyll may remember this from the

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,670
cross-sections illipe this compromises

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,050
the bulk of internal leaf tissue in the

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,420
majority site of the photosynthetic

26
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,849
process and plants since they contain

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,829
large amounts of chloroplasts the inner

28
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,709
tissue parenchyma of a leaf containing

29
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:13,109
many chloroplasts is located right here

30
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:15,149
bundle sheath cells see here layer of

31
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,430
cells and leaves in stems that surround

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,040
vascular bundles remember vascular

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,130
bundles here are Zalman phloem and c4

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,140
plants the bundle sheath cells contain

35
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:28,199
chloroplasts and are the site of sight

36
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,299
of the calvin cycle so again be able to

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,189
compare c3 c4 and also PM plants here

38
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:36,450
just give me the example of each c3 is

39
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:38,399
most plants and they follow the steps

40
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,439
presented as what we call normal it's

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,299
located right here Kalen cycle occurs in

42
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,328
the mesophyll and occurs it's co2

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,220
directly and produces glucose c4 plants

44
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,158
Carmack's aid is incorporated to a four

45
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,048
carbon compound in the mesophyll and the

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,290
calvin cycle occurs in the bundle sheath

47
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,969
itself in the cam pathway common

48
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,610
actually is actually stored as an acid

49
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:02,669
at night and it is fed through the

50
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:04,590
calvin cycle during the day and again

51
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,210
the talon cycle here is occurring in the

52
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,590
mesophyll

53
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:09,478
give you an idea what these plans to

54
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,060
make connect to c3 plants so beam

55
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,830
example of a tomato plant c4 plants

56
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,870
would be like corn

57
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,580
and cam plants would be a cactus so c3

58
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,750
plants common plant type of the Calvin

59
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,030
cycle Biden carbon dioxide to the

60
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,800
Rubisco enzyme most efficient during

61
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,219
cool and moist conditions with normal

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,260
light this is compared to c4 and cam

63
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:33,000
plants most plants live in cool moist

64
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:35,639
conditions with normal light this is why

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,849
most plants are c3 plants here's just a

66
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:43,579
couple examples typical garden plants

67
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:46,199
maybe got a field of crops all c3 plants

68
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,270
see for now is we're starting to differ

69
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,979
c4 plants have an intermediate before

70
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,870
carbon dioxide binds to the Rubisco

71
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,780
which benefits the plants in hotter

72
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,259
climates corn sugarcane crabgrass are

73
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,640
examples of c4 plants stomata are still

74
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,769
open during the day which is an

75
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,559
important step which is different than a

76
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:08,430
cam plant no such intermediates asilah

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,979
acetate in Mele I try to highlight here

78
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,189
in little blue circles this is an

79
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:18,000
intermediate step before carbon dioxide

80
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:22,349
binds with the Rubisco this intermediate

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,199
before it goes through that process see

82
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:29,039
here come accident corporate into a four

83
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,979
carbon compound a steel acetate here

84
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,689
four carbon sugar I'm sorry for common

85
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,329
compound here in order to make

86
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:39,359
ultimately our sugars come to activate a

87
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,100
Shell via malate or aspartate from the

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,140
mesophyll cells to the bundle sheath

89
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,629
cells in these bundle sheath cells

90
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:49,139
carbon dioxide is released by

91
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:50,789
decarboxylation of Maui so what does all

92
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,250
this mean we have our carbon oxide

93
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:56,039
coming in we have this kind of

94
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,569
intermediate that's occurring remember

95
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,400
if you remember from our regular post

96
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:02,310
synthetic process instead of the three

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,219
carbon PGA compound in c3 plants region

98
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,800
this acid as an intermediate to bind

99
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:09,090
ultimately this four carbon compound so

100
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,950
it's going to feed the carbon from the

101
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,259
carbon dioxide into the Calvin cycle

102
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,810
now the calvin cycle doesn't change it's

103
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,959
the same it's just the preparation these

104
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:23,449
plants go through to be able to deliver

105
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,449
that carbon has this intermediate step

106
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:30,959
with high light in temperature c4 plants

107
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,350
for synthesised faster than c3 plants c4

108
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,659
plants have better water use efficiency

109
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,750
because the use of the PEP carboxylase

110
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,060
brings her monoxide in faster and can

111
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,399
keep the stomata closed longer so this

112
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,189
is the advantage to the 4 carbon

113
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,709
intermediate is that in high light and

114
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:51,920
water stress conditions c4 plants can

115
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:55,680
take up carbon oxide more efficiently

116
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,840
they're also better in highlight in the

117
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,970
Gandhis temperature conditions because

118
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,789
they're able to keep the stomata closed

119
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:06,030
longer eliminating water loss in corn

120
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,500
plants to be this example vs. Arce c3

121
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:09,989
plants which should be in this case an

122
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,250
elm tree here we have this direct

123
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,350
binding of chrome accenting the

124
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,360
mesophyll cells and closes stomata and

125
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,850
then the carbon dioxide can essentially

126
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,550
will say be processed before entering

127
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,610
the calvin cycle here just a comparison

128
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:26,340
of c3 plants at low light and high light

129
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,360
and the rate of opposite synthesis we

130
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,489
notice that the carbon acid

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,040
concentration that differs between our

132
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,040
c4 plants even had almost no carbon

133
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,740
dioxide the rate of carbon oxide uptake

134
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,900
is greater in c4 plants simply because

135
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,800
they're slightly more efficient at it we

136
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:46,439
keep their stomata closed longer

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,280
complaints are crassulacean acid

138
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:53,550
metabolism succulents and cacti are

139
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:57,000
examples commonly found in very hot dry

140
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,980
areas such as deserts in these plants

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,319
corrected is stored in the form of an

142
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,020
acid before the photosynthetic processes

143
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,029
can occur the stomata are open at night

144
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:08,129
and the question is well what's an angel

145
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:09,719
opening stomata at night why don't they

146
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,519
do it during the daylight just about all

147
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,860
the other plants there's a specific

148
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,109
reason for that because they're in such

149
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,480
hot and dry environments the water loss

150
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,480
would be too great opening stomata at

151
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,759
night allowing the co2 to come in

152
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,939
eliminates lots of water loss but keep

153
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,620
in mind that we need light to form the

154
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,439
photosynthetic process and this creates

155
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,879
a challenge in plants sticking with

156
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,560
those complaints day versus night

157
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,629
there's definitely differences between

158
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,120
the two here's our day we know it's her

159
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,050
stomata are closed here during they it

160
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,209
is open his allowing

161
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,430
next need to come in but water vapor is

162
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:48,128
also leading but because it's at night

163
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,918
not a lot of hot and sunlight intensity

164
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:53,199
the amount of water lost is definitely

165
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,870
reduced but they need to have steps in

166
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,658
place to be able to utilize that co2 to

167
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,709
be able to use in the light reaction

168
00:06:57,658 --> 00:07:01,149
give you a little bit of an idea at

169
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:04,269
night the operation rates are typically

170
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:05,978
lower reducing water loss carbon oxide

171
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:08,649
is converted to an acid and that's the

172
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:10,598
key part here our malate acid before

173
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:14,019
being used in the light dependent

174
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:15,968
reaction you can't plants during the day

175
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:18,579
the acids broken down and the co2 is

176
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:21,490
released e 2 for pisco or imposes a

177
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:23,709
synthetic process to occur simply put

178
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,718
that stomas opening corrects it's coming

179
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:28,448
in that carbon is being stored as an

180
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:31,930
acid then during the day the stomata are

181
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,939
closed and this acid now is being fed

182
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,459
into the light dependent reaction and

183
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:38,620
that carbon dioxide is being released in

184
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:40,870
the normal cart the c3 plant

185
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,689
photosynthetic process occurs but the

186
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,668
stomata remain closed that carbon F is

187
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:47,829
being released from the acid and that

188
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:51,218
close to mana during the day eliminates

189
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:53,109
the water loss of the plan in general

190
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:55,240
summary corrects it stored as a Ford

191
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,770
carbon acid malli in that cools at night

192
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,598
during the daytime

193
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:00,189
the malli is transferred to chloroplast

194
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:01,689
where it's converted back to carbon

195
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:04,360
dioxide which is then used for the

196
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:07,060
photosynthetic process the pre collected

197
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,580
carbon dioxide is concentrated around

198
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,740
the enzyme rubisco increasing low

199
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:13,359
synthetic efficiency and that's what we

200
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,519
see here's our day here's our night

201
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,620
cycle at night our common acids coming

202
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,689
in we're storing it as an acid in the

203
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,389
vacuole then during the day we're

204
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:25,149
releasing that acid we're breaking apart

205
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:27,310
the co2 run out to the calvin cycle to

206
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:28,870
generate our sugars in this case and

207
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,509
remember this occurs with plants at an

208
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,229
extremely dry and arid conditions like

209
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,229
these cactus here
