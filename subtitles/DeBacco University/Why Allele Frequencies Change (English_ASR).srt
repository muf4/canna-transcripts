1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,129
here we're going to answer the question

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:06,960
of why allele frequencies change so why

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:09,120
in this case if we have one red

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,219
individual that then goes to four then

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,410
shifts basically the whole population to

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,359
the red individuals why do the allele

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,868
frequencies change over time go through

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,429
a couple of reasons why this is so the

9
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:21,839
hardy-weinberg equation is true only if

10
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,660
the following five assumptions are met

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,089
again large population size random

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,189
mating no mutations no migration no

13
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,289
natural selection they talked about in

14
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,719
those videos this rarely occurs in a

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,520
normal population so there's five

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,380
evolutionary forces that can seemingly

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,530
alter the allele frequency in the

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,260
population genetic drift non-random

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,539
mating mutation migration and selection

20
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,000
are all things that can cause this shift

21
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,219
to occur remember these are assumed in

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,808
the hardy-weinberg equation but this is

23
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,808
a little bit more accurate that we might

24
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:58,229
see in a given population you see here

25
00:00:54,808 --> 00:01:00,269
50 percent of individuals targeted by

26
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,738
predators here the brown ones have good

27
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,079
camouflage the black ones have poor

28
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,450
camouflage and over certain generations

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:11,519
we see a selection for the brown

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,368
phenotype so five agents for

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,989
evolutionary change one is mutation

32
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:17,938
mutations occur again just normally with

33
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:20,158
DNA polymerase it can also be influenced

34
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:22,319
by the environment gene flow the

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,409
movement of genes from one population to

36
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,109
another non-random mating were in this

37
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,810
case we see a female to seeing this male

38
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:34,319
over this male with show your feathers

39
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,259
resulting in a population as shifted to

40
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,758
show we are fellas genetic drift where

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,118
we're drifting towards a certain

42
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,950
phenotype they have course selection for

43
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,019
in this case it could be one color that

44
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,259
camouflage is better compared to another

45
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:51,030
color so genetic drift let's explain

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,379
this just a little bit neck drift in a

47
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,500
population can lead to the elimination

48
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,759
of allele from a population by chance in

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,950
each generation a random set of

50
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,140
individuals reproduces to produce the

51
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,790
next generation the frequency of alleles

52
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,320
in the next generation is equal to the

53
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,229
frequency of alleles among the

54
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,030
individuals be producing and we see here

55
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,128
here's our population very similar to

56
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,830
the first one that we said the genetic

57
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:16,409
drift here the brown ones producing it

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,270
with some heteros heterozygotes and some

59
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,780
homozygous dominance let me see this

60
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,120
population reading here and we noticed

61
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,640
that now we have all homozygous dominant

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,770
here so again this is just a genetic

63
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:33,179
drift drifting towards a certain

64
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,680
genotype random sampling and genetic

65
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,950
drifts over a lots a little animation

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,560
here occurs over five generations it's a

67
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,149
simulation of common example used to

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,270
describe the effect of random sampling

69
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,250
as genetic drah in this population of 20

70
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,800
there's a shift from an allele frequency

71
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,599
of 50% of the blue allele to a hundred

72
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,850
percent for the blue allele in just five

73
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,509
generations so we see here's a nice

74
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:59,939
50/50 the original population our second

75
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:03,090
generation goes through this sampling we

76
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:06,120
see there's been a increase in the

77
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,069
number of the blue alleles and this is

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,050
again a random sampling here once it get

79
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,599
to choose to pass on their genes to the

80
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,550
following generation after three

81
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,039
generations we see there's even a

82
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,800
greater reduction now because this is a

83
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,509
random sampling this doesn't mean that

84
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,120
it's always going to occur in the same

85
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:26,579
proportion as we'll see in this

86
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,069
animation if we're able to count the red

87
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,810
alleles so there's actually one more in

88
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,489
this case we're getting to the fifth

89
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:36,599
generation only the blue ones are

90
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,550
selected and that's what carries on so

91
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,349
this genetic drift it's a random loss of

92
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,900
alleles more likely to occur in a

93
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:44,879
smaller population the founder effect is

94
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,730
a small group of individuals establishes

95
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,709
a population in a new location so often

96
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,599
this is the result and what happens so

97
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,099
here's our parent population we have a

98
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,109
migrating population which is a very

99
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,379
small portion of this total individuals

100
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,420
they form here we notice that the purple

101
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,949
ones initially are very small presented

102
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,409
well for whatever reason those are

103
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,329
selected for and we see now a greater

104
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,129
percentage of them also by getting to

105
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,830
the loss of the red allele - only the

106
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,689
purple wheels this occurs typically more

107
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,209
common in smaller populations when a

108
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:17,790
group may leave one area or one island

109
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,530
to go to another island if that isolated

110
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,610
population and we get that separation

111
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,439
they are occurring over time the random

112
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,270
lost allele is more likely occur in that

113
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,750
smaller population and it's also true

114
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:31,589
for

115
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,319
is termed the bottleneck effect so again

116
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:36,269
under genetic drift we have the founder

117
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,589
effect which is a small group of

118
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:39,779
intervals establishing in a new location

119
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:41,939
then we have the bottleneck effect -

120
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,189
sudden decrease in population size due

121
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,889
to natural forces kind of that necking

122
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:48,899
down here parent population significant

123
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,990
genetic variation a bottleneck event

124
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:54,209
occurs could be disease could be famine

125
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,710
could be a whole host of reasons it's

126
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:57,269
called a bottle on because it goes

127
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:59,639
through a small opening and we ever

128
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:02,339
survive in population here the green and

129
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,889
the same thing here high initial

130
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,689
population bottleneck effect reducing

131
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,370
the population in this case looking for

132
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,990
these particular individuals

133
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,149
it's a term bottleneck because that's

134
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,590
what referring to of the neckla bottle

135
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:17,310
where it thins down a large population

136
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:19,229
being forced to a small area non-random

137
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,629
mating this is meaning that occurs more

138
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,030
or less frequently than expected by

139
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,949
chance inbreeding mating with relatives

140
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,679
increases the homo homozygous

141
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,759
outbreeding with meaning meeting with

142
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,280
non-relatives

143
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,839
degrees heterozygous e so non-random

144
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,839
mating means that the individuals are

145
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,359
being selected for some reason it's not

146
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,869
just random theirs could be in this case

147
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,939
the brown color is deemed favorable

148
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,829
mutations and other reason why allele

149
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:49,199
frequencies change errors in DNA

150
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:52,469
replication this is the ultimate source

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,180
of new variation mutation rates are too

152
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,310
low too significant significant altered

153
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,050
genetic frequencies on their own there

154
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,209
also needs to be kind of selection

155
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,220
forces and it's there when we say

156
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:05,039
mutation takes us back to some previous

157
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,560
lectures myself over here I can have

158
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,210
some silent mutations and nonsense and

159
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,759
missense mutations there could be some

160
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:14,819
more drastic ones such as duplication

161
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,439
inversion insertion translocation so all

162
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,000
of these are different types of

163
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:23,040
mutations that could occur you know all

164
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,509
errors in DNA migration movement of

165
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,229
individuals from one population to

166
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:30,810
another a very potent agent for change

167
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:34,050
there's immigration moving in to a

168
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:37,470
population in emigration movement out or

169
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:41,550
exiting a population so we see on this

170
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:44,879
side we see the emigrating population

171
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,550
exiting and then on this side we see the

172
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:51,419
immigrating population so we see that

173
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,788
this almost I guess recessive bird has

174
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,948
emigrated and emigrated into this

175
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,699
population these are all homozygous

176
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,530
dominant

177
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,569
now with this individual here assume

178
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:03,288
that survives and reproduces will now

179
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:08,158
increase the allele frequencies of the

180
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:10,348
recessive allele last portion of

181
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:13,050
selection here as a selection process

182
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:14,639
some of it'll leave behind more

183
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,720
offspring than others sorry for that

184
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,728
overlap there

185
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,530
artificial selection is when breeders

186
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,269
select desired characteristics and

187
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:24,209
natural selection is the environment

188
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:26,848
selecting for that selection is as is a

189
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:29,098
stats concept here in math basically you

190
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:30,658
have your sample and you have a sample

191
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:32,310
within the population you're selecting

192
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,889
for that one in this case a particular

193
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,930
individual cannot predict the fate of

194
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,550
any single individual but it's possible

195
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,870
to predict what kind of individual will

196
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,788
tend to become more common in a

197
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,939
population so it can't be for very

198
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:47,250
specific reasons the exact individuals

199
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,439
we kind of indicate here well the

200
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,718
individual can probably determine what

201
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,339
traits this individual might have the

202
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:56,158
goals have a subset a larger population

203
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:59,718
as Representative pulling from each of

204
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:59,718
the groups here to get our sample
