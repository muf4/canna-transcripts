1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,918
here i'm going to go over some basic

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,639
tire information that may involve some

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,480
things

4
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,558
that you've seen but maybe not have

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,559
appreciated what is actually there

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,000
on a tire so starting with the

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,479
components of a tire a whole tire

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
composed of linear sidewall rubber beads

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,240
belts and tread rubber

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,919
and there's several layers composed of

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,439
them so this helps give them their

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,320
strength helps give them their shape

13
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,518
and helps allow them to stay flexible so

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,278
again there's a lot of different

15
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:27,919
components a lot of different kind of

16
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,759
layers

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,199
but we're basically looking at sidewall

18
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,200
rubber beads and belts

19
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,960
tread rubber being the main components

20
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,399
there but some may even include some

21
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,679
steel belts

22
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,439
to help give them rigidity and strength

23
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,119
now the tread elements if we're looking

24
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,679
at the exterior of the tire there's

25
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,479
grooves which go around the tire

26
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,200
we have slots which are transverse to

27
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,799
the tire

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
we have a swipe which are these small

29
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,159
little grooves if you look here they're

30
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,878
located right here to be considered the

31
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,799
swipes

32
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,718
and we also have something called a

33
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,878
tread wear indicator

34
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,239
and these are raised bars that indicate

35
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,438
the tread wear

36
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,879
and they're located not many in

37
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,719
all components of the tire but if you

38
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,679
rotate it through and look closely

39
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,000
you will find some tread wear indicators

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
on

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
tires on maybe even your car so these

42
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,599
impressions

43
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,439
and tracks we have the tire impressions

44
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,319
that are the tread design and dimensions

45
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,239
of the tire

46
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,599
we have the tread tracks which are

47
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,079
related to the dimensions

48
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,118
of related to the wheels so it's

49
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,798
important to take these into

50
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,159
consideration as well as with some of

51
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,439
the exterior components

52
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,240
when you're trying to identify a

53
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,839
particular tire or make a match

54
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,199
something you may not have realized is

55
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,320
that there's something called a noise

56
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,439
treatment to

57
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,279
tires so tires don't have the exact same

58
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,798
pattern that repeats equally

59
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
throughout the entire circumference of

60
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,159
the tire by mixing the design elements

61
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,680
manufacturers can impact the amount of

62
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,680
noise a tire may generate

63
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
if tire designs were exactly repeated

64
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,759
around the tire unwanted noise would

65
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,519
occur

66
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,439
kind of create a wall especially going

67
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,239
down the highway alternating small

68
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,078
medium large

69
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,319
lengths create different pitches this

70
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:05,279
helps reduce the overall noise

71
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,398
you can see that indicated here where we

72
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,560
have these kind of

73
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,000
different kind of elements of different

74
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,159
lengths

75
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,959
inserted around the tire tread to help

76
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,318
reduce the noise instead it's given

77
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,080
one of those things called i mentioned

78
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:20,000
tread wear indicators

79
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,680
so if you look at this tire may not see

80
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
them initially but highlighted them here

81
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,239
little

82
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
arrows they are located on the tire and

83
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,120
they're little wear bars

84
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,200
they're basically a rubber bar that's

85
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,360
raised about 1 16 above the base

86
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,839
of the grooves of the tire the dt

87
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,840
requires six tread wear indicators

88
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,598
so because there's quilt only six if you

89
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,878
look at one particular small spot the

90
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,479
tire you may not see it

91
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,000
so you have to rotate the tower or look

92
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,518
at a different portion

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,519
as the tread wears down these will

94
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,239
become noticeable and offer an

95
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,280
indication

96
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,719
for replacement we also have when we're

97
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,919
looking at tires we're looking at

98
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,719
something called original

99
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,159
and replacement tires so this can get

100
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,318
into when we're trying to identify or

101
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,479
match a car to a crime scene

102
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,238
original equipment oe tires they're sold

103
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,639
on new cars thousands of cars have the

104
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,800
same

105
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,238
brand in size then we have something

106
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
called replacement tires and they're

107
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,878
purchased to replace old worn tires

108
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,719
typically different than the original

109
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,000
equipment tires and there's a whole

110
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,199
bunch of different tires that you can

111
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,759
select from

112
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,399
if you're looking at replacing tires and

113
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,000
then lastly we have retread tires

114
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,000
so sadly probably familiar with seeing

115
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,318
this on the highway where the retreats

116
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,239
will

117
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,759
break off but re-trade tires are

118
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,640
primarily used for commercial or fleet

119
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,719
vehicles in

120
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,559
the united states two types of retread

121
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,919
processes there's a mold cure process

122
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,799
and there's a pre-cured

123
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,399
process some retreat tires have valuable

124
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,319
individual characteristics

125
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,480
which provide information to the

126
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,958
examiner what they basically are just as

127
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,119
the name implies they're a new tread

128
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,479
that has been put on an existing or

129
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,000
older tire

130
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,919
sadly because of this process they could

131
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,759
break down especially with the heat of

132
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,199
being on the highway and end up as

133
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,679
a hazard along the road but be mindful

134
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,639
that these retread tires have new tread

135
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,439
but are on older or potentially original

136
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,438
tires
