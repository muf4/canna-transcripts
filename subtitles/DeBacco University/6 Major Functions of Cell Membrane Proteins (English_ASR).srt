1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,439
okay this is an excellent title slide

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,899
showing the six major functions of

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,089
membrane proteins suggest you watch the

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,679
video and you come back to this and it's

5
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,689
just kind of that the self quiz and can

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,669
you understand all these images right

7
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,019
now they may not make a lot of sense but

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,969
if you look through the slides I have a

9
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,489
one on each and then come back to this

10
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:23,368
and hopefully it will make more sense

11
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:25,288
start with the first one transport cell

12
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:26,730
one major function is transport this

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,140
side may looks familiar from one of the

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,018
previous ones

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,509
it is important function there's many

16
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:36,449
different forms of transport in general

17
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:39,109
here on the left side of the image we

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,000
have our proteins that span the membrane

19
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:44,100
these may provide hydrophilic channels

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,230
across membranes and it's electives for

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,450
a particular cell you in this case it

22
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,189
slightly little green molecules to come

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,559
through on the right side of the image

24
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:55,079
these carrier proteins require energy

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,089
they're actively grabbing these more

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,620
oval molecules and transporting them

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:04,588
through the phospholipid bilayer another

28
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:06,899
major function is enzymatic activity a

29
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:09,269
protein built into the membrane may be

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,450
an enzyme with the Aptus I exposed the

31
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:14,039
substances in adjacent solution in some

32
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,560
cases several enzymes in the membrane

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,350
are organized as a team that carries out

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,019
sequential steps of medevac pathways so

35
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:25,429
we see the example here we have lactose

36
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:28,590
and remember ace at the end of any word

37
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,380
indicates it could be an enzyme in this

38
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,109
case it is it's taking our lactose and

39
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,359
breaking them apart this disaccharide

40
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,239
from were from off carbohydrates into

41
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,989
it's two monosaccharides a glucose and

42
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:46,589
galactose so here's our disaccharide

43
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:48,750
lactose being broken apart into its two

44
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,030
monosaccharides glucose and galactose

45
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,060
this is because of enzymatic activity

46
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,469
that's embedded into the membranes

47
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,009
remember enzymes are specific types of

48
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:02,218
proteins all enzymes are proteins not

49
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,939
all proteins are enzymes signal

50
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:05,069
transduction

51
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,109
so a membrane protein may have a binding

52
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:08,609
site a specific shape that fits the

53
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,060
shape of the chemical messengers which

54
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,130
is a hormone the external messenger

55
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,509
signal may cause a conformational change

56
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:17,729
the protein receptor that relays that

57
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:20,129
message inside the cell what does that

58
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:23,609
mean that simply means we have a

59
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,979
receptor protein embedded in the see

60
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,290
some membrane here it's binding to a

61
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,899
specific hormone and that is basically

62
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:32,280
leading to secondary messages and a

63
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,819
response in the cell

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,849
remember our active site can be is very

65
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,259
particular and what its binding to it's

66
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:44,629
a very specific shape

67
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,629
okay the example and lock and key model

68
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,910
another major function there are cell to

69
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,039
cell recognition some glycoproteins

70
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:55,469
serve as identification tags that are

71
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,389
specific to recognized by other cells

72
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:59,159
this is very important in the immune

73
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:00,779
system we want to know what sells

74
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,969
herself and what cells are foreign

75
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,879
so these glycoproteins are very

76
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:08,250
important to highlighting one right here

77
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,109
for cell recognition so cells can

78
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,229
recognize other cells for binding

79
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,680
purposes could be for attacking purposes

80
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:19,979
to recognize what self what self versus

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,240
something that's not self might be AA v

82
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:23,549
one along those same lines are

83
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,710
intercellular joining membrane proteins

84
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,110
have adjacent cells made up together in

85
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,070
various kinds of junctions to dis cap or

86
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,040
tight junctions

87
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,859
this can help allow cells to closer

88
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,620
communicate can also can allow for

89
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,510
easier exchange of materials so this

90
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:45,090
intracellular joining is another major

91
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:47,310
function of our membrane proteins six

92
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,680
attachment of these cytoskeleton and

93
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,840
extracellular matrix which is relayed

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,819
ECM on some occasions these

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,490
microfilaments and other elements set a

96
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,479
set of skeleton may be bonded to

97
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,459
membrane proteins

98
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,739
so we have our micro filaments here at

99
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,969
the cytoskeleton here's our protein some

100
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,150
kind of binding and holding everything

101
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:08,219
together here this is function helps to

102
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,500
maintain cell shape stabilizes location

103
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,699
of certain membrane proteins sometimes

104
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,620
we want our proteins to be able to move

105
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,229
through the fluid mosaic other times we

106
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,798
want them fixed in place and this could

107
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:21,150
help maintain them in specific locations

108
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,379
proteins adhere to the ECM it can

109
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,939
coordinate extracellular and

110
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,949
intracellular changes remember ECM

111
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:29,870
are you fronting to extracellular matrix

112
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:33,170
this kind of shows just a graphical

113
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,209
representation of that that is the six

114
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:38,840
major functions and remember to go back

115
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:41,120
to that beginning slide here and to just

116
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,409
review and to be understand a little bit

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,410
about each of the sex
