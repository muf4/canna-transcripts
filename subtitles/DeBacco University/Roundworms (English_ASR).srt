1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,290
so here we're looking at round worms or

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,910
nematodes and we see two pictured right

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:11,129
here and we get into a little more

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,449
detail of what defines these animals so

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,280
starting in general the evolution of the

6
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,500
body cavity is one distinguishing factor

7
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,239
again I show some human examples here to

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,149
help reiterate the point remember we are

9
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,879
talking about nematodes this body cavity

10
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:26,518
is a key evolutionary step this body

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:29,899
cavity helps improve animal body design

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:32,879
in three main areas circulation for one

13
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:35,339
movement for another and lastly organ

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,500
function how organs are able to be able

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,930
to perform at a very high efficiency

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,269
level and it helps through the aid of a

17
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:46,350
circulatory system which can improve an

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,760
animal's overall movement now runners in

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,859
that body cavity if you've been watching

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,808
these videos in order talked about

21
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,058
initially you may remember a Sulha mates

22
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,459
may have no body cavity these are our

23
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,169
flat worms we're progressing up now to

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,600
our pseudo cela mates that have a body

25
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,149
cavity located between the mesoderm in

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,570
the endoderm these are our nematodes or

27
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,890
nematodes here we're going to continue

28
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:10,199
with other videos here and other

29
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,390
sections asilah mates and they have a

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,090
body cavity that develops lee entirely

31
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,009
within the mesoderm so these are kind of

32
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,500
a great picture here with some similar

33
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,540
colorations this allows you to compare

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,400
and see some similarities there's also

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,350
differences between these different

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,509
animals here and again we're talking

37
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,809
about Suseela mates here with our brown

38
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,810
worms

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,969
so within the Suseela make a phylum in

40
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,099
nematodes our nematodes they're the

41
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:40,078
largest kind of speech number of species

42
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,809
within this phylum so these are

43
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,919
unsegmented as we can see here

44
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,618
cylindrical worms covered by a flexible

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,439
cuticle that is molten as they grow

46
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:51,599
there are animals that molt now they're

47
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,099
very small in the different environments

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,649
particularly soil environments or within

49
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:58,908
plants also you might be more familiar

50
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,840
with these than you actually realize

51
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:02,640
sadly if you're familiar with him you

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,130
might be familiar with them in a bad way

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,950
some nematodes are parasitic in humans

54
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:10,618
cats dogs and animals and this is why

55
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,289
they're of economic importance heartworm

56
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,889
in dog is is caused by nematodes and as

57
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:16,079
much as

58
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,739
here these are all those kind of

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,260
parasites living inside there

60
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,000
trichinosis here is infection caused by

61
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:26,789
nematodes and it's transmitted to humans

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,699
who eat undercooked pork is an example

63
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:30,329
of one kind of living inside this muscle

64
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:32,969
tissue here

65
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,420
okay might have a dog about getting some

66
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:38,340
pills to forego heartworm and you want

67
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,339
to avoid this at all costs he R and this

68
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,689
is caused by parasitic nematodes

69
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,370
don't you think all of these are bad

70
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,319
because there are some beneficial ones

71
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,180
so there's actually beneficial versions

72
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,729
they can be used to specifically attack

73
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,280
pests such as grubs that live in soil it

74
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,929
can be difficult to control otherwise so

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,219
if you ever know anyone's trying to you

76
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,860
know have a healthy lawn and get rid of

77
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,780
grubs they may apply pesticides or those

78
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,720
pesticides can kill other insects and

79
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,729
reduce the earthworm population and just

80
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,709
be negative for the environment well

81
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,719
adding beneficial nematodes here and

82
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,759
there's different strains what they do

83
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,430
is they seek out and they feed on they

84
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,799
parasitize these grubs and they multiply

85
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,329
with inside the grub and when the

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,880
population gets really high not only

87
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:24,030
does the grow up die but we see all of

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,459
these other individuals released and

89
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,650
they can go out and find other grubs and

90
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,269
they can kind of do the same thing and

91
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,769
you could take a grass region that would

92
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,750
look like this for a chopped-up because

93
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,060
these grubs are eating all the roots and

94
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,209
distorting the plants so ideally a nice

95
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,750
green fairway or lawn here purely

96
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:45,000
through the product of these nematodes

97
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,459
going through in finding in eating out

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,949
all of the grubs so that you don't have

99
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,870
any issues with in mass multiplying

100
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:54,169
actually the beneficial nematodes go

101
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,400
through and through the process of

102
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:58,500
degrading the grub and eating the inside

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,289
and spread through and help correct a

104
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,289
problem without any pesticides needed
