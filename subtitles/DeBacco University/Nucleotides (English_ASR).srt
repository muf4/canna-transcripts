1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
okay here we're look at nucleotides so

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,378
for those playing the home game we'll

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,320
recognize these as a monomeric unit or

4
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:13,768
the building block for our nucleic acids

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,900
we see them listed right here are we're

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,300
going to define our primitives and our

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,429
purines are your cells timing cytosine

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,789
adenine and guanine we'll make up our

9
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:26,489
nucleotides so looking specifically our

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,070
nucleic acids a nucleotide is composed

11
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:32,519
of three parts one is a nitrogenous base

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,380
and this is a nitrogen base containing a

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,510
carbon nitrogen ring so we see the

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,390
nitrogen is located here carbon would be

15
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:41,308
located here here here this indicates a

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,920
double bond between these two carbons so

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:46,280
one of the components of our nucleic

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,289
acids is our nitrogen containing base

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,570
that is linked to a five carbon sugar

20
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,300
we'll just call the pentose sugar and

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,698
this is ribose in RNA which stands for

22
00:00:54,299 --> 00:01:00,209
ribonucleic acid and it's sugar would be

23
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,948
a deoxyribose in DNA you'll see it as

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,170
comparison between those two in a moment

25
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:07,618
then we have a phosphate group here

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,540
appeal for molecule you'll notice the

27
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:10,950
oxygens have negative charges to them

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,250
this is what gives

29
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,770
nucleic acids their negative charge on

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,390
their backbone because here we have the

31
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:20,849
oxygens creating that negative charge

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,920
this is kind of that base see located

33
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:24,298
here again and that's it's causing it to

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,290
have a negative charge so we do

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,270
electrophoresis

36
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,880
they'll be pulled towards a positive

37
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,500
charge so I said here can we spot the

38
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,828
difference between deoxyribose and

39
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,400
ribose looking specifically at that and

40
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:40,258
touch sugar there well if you look at a

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,728
little bit I mean you know deoxy means

42
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,799
without an oxygen you know so this is

43
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,090
missing something and we see that

44
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,140
indicated right here

45
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,478
our rainbows has an oxygen and the deoxy

46
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,790
is means without oxygen so therefore

47
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:59,039
that does not have oxygen bound to it

48
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:02,250
sugar now looking over here we have our

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,070
purines located up here the appearance

50
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,849
are a double ring and nitrogen base they

51
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:11,530
are classified as adenine and guanine

52
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:14,920
have these double ring structures

53
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,870
now on this side children over here

54
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:20,319
there were primitives and these are a

55
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,620
single ring nitrogen base and cytosine

56
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,539
which be present in both DNA and RNA

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,990
diamine will only be present in DNA and

58
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:31,179
uracil will only be present in RNA so

59
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,830
when we look at our nucleotides if that

60
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:38,379
can help us identify what particular

61
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,990
nucleic acid we are looking at lastly

62
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:42,909
here are pairing of nucleotides

63
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,219
nucleotides bond between DNA strands

64
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:47,439
what we call complementary strands they

65
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:50,709
are not identical there's always a

66
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:53,919
pureeing linked with a pyrimidine by way

67
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:57,879
of hydrogen bonds as we see here a vines

68
00:02:53,919 --> 00:03:00,189
with T T binds with a G binds with C and

69
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,560
C binds of J's are complementary not

70
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:05,590
identical strands we look down one side

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,680
of the DNA adenine a by DT gives me a

72
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,479
complementary thymine on the other side

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,030
same thing here we see a guanine there

74
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,799
will be a complementary cytosine on the

75
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,009
other side when we're looking at

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,380
particular DNA because we see thymine

77
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:24,179
here hopefully that helps describes the

78
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:24,180
monomeric units nucleic acids
