1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
here we will have the controversial

2
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,580
topic of designer babies

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,189
another question probably right now in

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,230
your mind is is that a picture of me and

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,440
I'll get right to it now the answer is

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,910
no it's not a picture of me had a try to

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,539
find a cute baby you don't want to

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,129
picture me on the title slide alright so

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,260
starting with what is a designer baby

10
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:24,239
well it's a baby whose genetic makeup

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,590
has been artificially selected for

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,049
through the process of genetic

13
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,489
engineering the real question comes in

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,710
is should couples be given the right to

15
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:34,049
alter their children's genes based on

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,149
their own preferences and/or likings

17
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:38,669
so should we allow parents to be able to

18
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:43,039
modify or pick for example here you see

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,570
maybe the eye color of their unborn baby

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,689
so a real-life situation relates to

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,750
designer babies is Adam Nash was one of

22
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:54,058
the world's first designer babies and

23
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:57,448
the reason why this one is important

24
00:00:54,058 --> 00:01:00,269
kayson's occurred back in 2000 is that

25
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:04,829
through the process of the parents

26
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,439
having certain genetic disorders this

27
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,569
child was born through the process of

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,899
what we would term now designer babies

29
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:16,019
to select for an individual that didn't

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,200
have the complications that were present

31
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:22,289
as carriers in both of the parents so

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,030
combination in vitro fertilization where

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,100
the egg is fertilized with sperm from

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,049
outside the womb embryos are grown to

35
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,719
the eight cell stage and are checked for

36
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,880
genetic disorders at that point it's a

37
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,099
major treatment in infertility it's now

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,500
being used for other reasons the only

39
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,989
healthy embryo was translated into the

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,340
mother's womb so we kind of grew up they

41
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:43,259
grew up some cells and they only

42
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,780
selected the ones that were a healthy

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,959
individual to avoid some complications

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,609
or disorders again tighten that realized

45
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,280
situation this parents are both care

46
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,019
carriers for a gene mutation that led to

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,968
their first dollar of Molly being born

48
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:01,500
with a rare and devastating genetic

49
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:04,019
disorder of anemia however the for her

50
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,450
what she had to go through was her bone

51
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:08,008
a bone marrow transplant and she is now

52
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,840
healthy and given the second chance of

53
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,639
life so red blood cells come from marrow

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,650
that's where the giantess order was

55
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,039
through the process of American

56
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,680
which is a very difficult and painful

57
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:22,289
trying process Molly was given a new

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,959
chance there on life but the designer

59
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:29,729
baby again going back here Adam through

60
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,310
the process of genetic engineering did

61
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:35,098
not have to go through that process so

62
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,479
simply having the genes modified avoided

63
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,000
the entire anemia from occurring in the

64
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,598
first place so doctors realized several

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,759
out of mother's eggs but only implanted

66
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,189
one that was genetically healthy they

67
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,679
selected for that one that did not carry

68
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:50,818
those genetic disorders however now

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,489
we're looking at designer babies today

70
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,138
today genetic technology has only been

71
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,120
used to treat serious diseases and

72
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:58,859
children but the possibility to alter

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,719
anything from gender to disease and

74
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:04,200
eventually appearance personality even

75
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,419
IQ is a possibility so it's called a

76
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,509
slippery slope here some believe that

77
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,280
parents will kind of eventually use this

78
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:13,560
to choose their own children's genes and

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,209
push for the creation of these designer

80
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,759
babies so looking for what they want

81
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,949
their unborn child to look like what

82
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,198
they want personality or they and so on

83
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,430
and so forth

84
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,780
so these are designer babies there's

85
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,879
some again there's some real pros to us

86
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,049
well last couples who can't conceive

87
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,959
normally to have children

88
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,400
a giant screening reduces baby's chances

89
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,859
of being born with serious genetic

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,919
diseases increases the likelihood of a

91
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:40,349
healthy baby allow those company couples

92
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,359
to balance gender in their families if

93
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:43,649
some families have nails or a lot of

94
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:46,319
females that can balance that they can

95
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,469
choose me other females the fear is

96
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:53,668
though there may be selecting for vision

97
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:57,239
for high oq4 no baldness for a perfect

98
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:59,939
pitch and so on in other traits if you

99
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,859
also notice the letters this baby is

100
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,259
playing with might give you some

101
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:08,750
indication of how that connects to

102
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:11,638
designer babies and DNA is my hint

103
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,769
since our babies disadvantage is it

104
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,989
moral or ethical too much playing like

105
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,759
God Erica the embryos would be killed

106
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,408
selected against oh that didn't turn out

107
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,668
right they could have been turned into

108
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:23,250
humans it'll be killed

109
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,620
there's social concerns high cost leads

110
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,418
to gaps in society could lead to

111
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,009
eugenics the breeding

112
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:31,740
individuals that are bred or designed

113
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,968
adult social preferences genetically

114
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,610
enhanced people may start to feel

115
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:36,930
superior to those who have not been

116
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,810
genetically altered the interest

117
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,340
selecting for different social worst

118
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:47,370
feelings so there could be implications

119
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:49,888
just beyond sequences of DNA I found

120
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,379
some interesting graphs and some

121
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:54,180
comparisons here I invite you to pause

122
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,379
the video at any time so you can look at

123
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,418
these I think they're pretty interesting

124
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,520
I'm just gonna read some of the titles

125
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:01,408
and want you to take a look at them so

126
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,500
genetic design what do parents want to

127
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:07,019
alter the most standpoint is alterations

128
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,439
ethical or unethical what do parents

129
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,899
want to alter the most we see some

130
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:16,169
traits here another one another

131
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:18,598
comparison how do women and men or how

132
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:21,538
would women and men design a baby's

133
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:22,949
personality so this is what the men I'm

134
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:25,438
sorry the women we want this is what the

135
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,300
men would want you see the percentages

136
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,599
are pretty close and some things and

137
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,389
then a little different on others also

138
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:34,829
how would women in men design a baby so

139
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,949
here's a little comparison of health

140
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:40,918
weight attractiveness hair color what

141
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:43,020
color would they want again for women

142
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,389
that would be designing the baby versus

143
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:52,490
men interesting to see the gender

144
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:55,769
differences between the two they're also

145
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,949
how Europeans and Americans would design

146
00:05:55,769 --> 00:06:01,188
the baby's personality so a baby made in

147
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:03,088
Europe and a baby made in America

148
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:05,069
looking at some of the same traits as

149
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:06,750
the one before for male the female and

150
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,528
how European Americans would design a

151
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,449
baby again

152
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:11,069
visit some of those same traits eye care

153
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:14,060
color eye color and so on and so forth

154
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:16,680
again just an interesting comparison

155
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,870
just food for thought again this is just

156
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,848
all theoretical but just gives you an

157
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,360
idea that there are differences between

158
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:27,870
males and females and also different

159
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,250
regions of the world so four against the

160
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,319
salmon babies what would you choose and

161
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,778
why how do you support the idea for

162
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,908
designer babies would you use your next

163
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:37,288
engineering for children simply to make

164
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:39,870
them more intelligent or better-looking

165
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:41,019
would you like to have a blond-haired

166
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,930
blue-eyed girl

167
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:46,568
that would be possible you like the

168
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,430
process of not knowing are you again are

169
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,680
you for or against supporting this idea

170
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,430
cuz it's an issue going to be faced with

171
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,430
going into the future

172
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,908
just some conclusions here looking at

173
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,918
after looking at some of the data seems

174
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:01,449
in moral or unethical to test embryos

175
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,908
for certain genes and tamper with them

176
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:06,129
Technologies Delta L thinks of safety

177
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:07,300
still a little bit of concern children's

178
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,939
lives could be saved

179
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,590
let's get major advantage fewer children

180
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,329
would be born with genetic disorders

181
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:14,948
there's many advantages and

182
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,490
disadvantages and a baby and you should

183
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,658
keep an open mind and unbiased attitude

184
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,759
here are people attempt near conclusions

185
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:23,560
people jumping to conclusions everywhere

186
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,379
so just because you think initially oh

187
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,810
yes for it or no I'm against it look at

188
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:32,978
some of both sides and develop an

189
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:35,829
educated decision another possibility

190
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:38,168
here is it possible to have three

191
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:41,139
parents and the answer is yes it

192
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:44,439
actually is possible as we know get the

193
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,750
mothers egg the father's sperm they come

194
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:49,870
together in the make an individual

195
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:53,860
however we have to remember there's DNA

196
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:58,259
in the mitochondria so technically we

197
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:01,750
could get a surrogate mother or a mother

198
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:04,569
mother's DNA for the mitochondria and

199
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,610
put that into a cell and technically

200
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,560
that individual would have the

201
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,639
mitochondria of the other mother

202
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,610
the main egg and genes from this mother

203
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,538
number one and this father's genes from

204
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:22,270
number three so yes it is possible to

205
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:25,329
get to be born from three parents a

206
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:27,339
little crazy against a bitter probably

207
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:29,918
better example here taking the mother's

208
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:33,250
egg the nucleus is removed and destroyed

209
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:35,978
we're taking inserting it here with the

210
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,360
donors normal mitochondria and we're

211
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,700
taking this firm from the father to

212
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,729
generate the individual this could be

213
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,980
used in situations where the mother's

214
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,550
egg has abnormal mitochondria that could

215
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,690
lead to genetic disorders so taking the

216
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:51,490
nucleus here removed and transferred

217
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,350
that to the donor that's where most of

218
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,820
the genes are kept and there's not a lot

219
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,310
of genes in the mind

220
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,800
but there are some so technically this

221
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:02,819
embryo will be developed from three

222
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,019
parents two mothers because all of your

223
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,510
mitochondria come from your mother and

224
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:10,240
your father's sperm cell so just a

225
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:11,559
interesting food for thought and kind of

226
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,779
the weird things that can occur with

227
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:17,259
science when you understand all of the

228
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:19,329
basics all behind it and just should

229
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:21,460
this be allowed again we're selecting

230
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,040
against the abnormal mitochondria that

231
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,560
will help the individual in the end talk

232
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,509
about ethics is it just because it's

233
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,739
possible does it mean we should do it

234
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,740
and that's the main question
