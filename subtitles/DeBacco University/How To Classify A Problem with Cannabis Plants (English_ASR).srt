1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,759
while precisely diagnosing a problem may

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,000
not always be possible

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,199
this debaco university video intends to

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,359
help you classify

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,440
problems of cannabis plants in general

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,160
categories so you can better direct your

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,919
efforts

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,920
to reduce their negative impact on your

9
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,920
plants

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,720
[Music]

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,960
all right let's get into how to classify

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,358
a problem with cannabis plants

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,039
so while many things can go wrong the

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
goal is to try to classify the issue to

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,880
help the diagnosis process along

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,280
with the potential corrective action to

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
be taken the main categories covered

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,079
will be

19
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,079
biotic and abiotic under biotic or

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,920
living diseases and insects

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
abiotic will look at nutrients spray

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,559
products moisture temperature

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,039
as well as physical damage so starting

24
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,759
with biotic probiotic is again living

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,359
these typically refers to a broad range

26
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,599
of disease insects or

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,600
animals while biotic means living

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,559
viruses are typically included within

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,280
this group

30
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,399
you'd also consider fungi bacteria

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,079
protists animals

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,760
archaea all these are classifying our

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,359
biotic factors

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,880
now disease is probably the most obvious

35
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,640
one that most people go to here we see

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,478
some powdery mildew getting started

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,079
diseases can have varying degrees of

38
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,239
impact depending on the variety being

39
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,759
grown in some cases but not always

40
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,759
some varieties may have different levels

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
of resistance to some disease especially

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,439
when the pressure is

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,759
low or when it initially comes in

44
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,758
diseases also tend to spread over time

45
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,118
with the rate being impacted by how

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
favorable the environment

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,599
is for that particular disease then

48
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,439
there's also insects here we see some

49
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,078
aphids on the underside of this cannabis

50
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,399
leaf

51
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,000
insects can have hatches meaning their

52
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,640
numbers can increase drastically

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,519
in a very short period of time scout

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,280
scouting the

55
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,438
shadier portions of the plant is a good

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,759
starting point controlling insects is

57
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,839
important as some particularly aphids

58
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
pictured here can vector diseases and

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,840
viruses as well

60
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,280
then we get to some abiotic factors so

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
these are non-living factors that can

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,960
impact plant growth and development

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,439
typically the rate and extent of damage

64
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,719
of plants is uniform across varieties

65
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,199
as also ages of the plant abiotic issues

66
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,280
tend

67
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,479
not to slowly spread but occur kind of

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,919
at a point in time

69
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,679
it could be a drastic change in

70
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,719
temperature sunlight

71
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,439
climate humidity things like that so

72
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,959
let's start with

73
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,120
nutrients looking at nutrients to begin

74
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,280
with note that these can be impacted by

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,280
ph as well as concentration

76
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,878
being able to recognize deficiencies is

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,400
important but at the same time

78
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,239
understanding how much to feed the plant

79
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,280
is key to avoid potential nutrient

80
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,800
toxicities

81
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,039
which often times with cannabis tends to

82
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,120
be more of an issue keeping records and

83
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,759
following manufacturers suggestions are

84
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,400
both good

85
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,759
starting points to ensure you're not

86
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,920
going into the toxic range

87
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,598
or the deficient range when it comes to

88
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,518
nutrients

89
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,000
then we get to spray products growers

90
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,560
may have to apply control products to

91
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,919
their

92
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,479
leaves this can offer very efficient

93
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,238
and efficient effective coverage but at

94
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,439
the same time it can risk damaging

95
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,759
tender leaf surfaces

96
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,959
particularly your newer leaves watch the

97
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,359
concentration

98
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,280
method and timing of your application

99
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
you want to avoid forceful applications

100
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,199
at high light intensity times as well

101
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,199
to reduce the chance of getting sort of

102
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,039
grower induced spray damage to your

103
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,039
particular leaves

104
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,959
then we have moisture to consider so

105
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,719
growers tend to over water their plants

106
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,759
and this reduces aeration within the

107
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,000
root zone

108
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,679
since plants roots need oxygen or over

109
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,919
watering can cause plants to drown

110
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,760
and also cause stunting of plants

111
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,839
underwatering though can cause wilting

112
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,000
which if caught early can be corrected

113
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,719
and remember a plant's water demands

114
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,680
will change

115
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,639
as it ages so as it gets older more loot

116
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,799
more roots

117
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,399
larger top structure the demand or the

118
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,760
amount of irrigation it will require

119
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,840
is going to be greater then we get to

120
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,359
temperature so when we're looking at

121
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
different temperatures

122
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
more is not better the goal is to keep

123
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,360
plants in a natural

124
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,680
daily rise and fall of temperatures

125
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,360
extremes will cause plant stresses

126
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,719
while outdoor environment regulation of

127
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,239
this may not be possible

128
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,318
other measures such as increased

129
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,120
irrigation frequency or potential use of

130
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,199
shade netting

131
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,959
should be considered when possible to

132
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,000
reduce plant stresses in an outdoor

133
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,239
environment

134
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
also keeping an idea of the high and low

135
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,358
temperature

136
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
uh the humidity as well kind of that 24

137
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,879
hour monitor

138
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,960
is a great suggestion temperatures above

139
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,079
nine degrees fahrenheit below 55 degrees

140
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,839
fahrenheit will be outside the

141
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,560
acceptable range and will hinder plant

142
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,679
performance overall lastly

143
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,600
we get to physical damage and this may

144
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,360
be easy to say but be careful around

145
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,160
plants especially when pruning and also

146
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,240
scouting

147
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
and also transporting some growers

148
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,360
simply are just tougher on their plants

149
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,638
than others so be mindful if you're one

150
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,520
of those growers it just has a heavy

151
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
hand

152
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,959
when transporting plants this can cause

153
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,759
damage to the branches maybe as we can

154
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,279
see here

155
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,759
and try to implement and reduce the

156
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,758
chance of that impact has on the plant

157
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,439
if growing outdoors wind can also cause

158
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,560
physical damage so be sure to provide

159
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,759
plant supports

160
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,000
if your plants will be growing in a

161
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,439
large size where this may be a likely

162
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,439
source of damage

163
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,120
hopefully this allows you to generally

164
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,160
classify potential problems you might be

165
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
seeing with your plant

166
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,199
then you can further refine a more

167
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,800
specific diagnosis

168
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,800
once you have the proper category

169
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,240
determined and hopefully this video here

170
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,639
in tobacco university

171
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,639
helped you categorize your problems
