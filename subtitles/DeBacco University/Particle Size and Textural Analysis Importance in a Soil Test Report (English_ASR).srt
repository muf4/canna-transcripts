1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,640
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,439
going over particle size and texture

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,769
analysis

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,940
that you may get with your soil test

5
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:10,939
[Music]

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,800
report the image here shows a nice

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,920
little relative comparison

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,880
of the larger sand particle the midsize

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,199
silt particle

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,000
and the small little particle here of

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,279
clay

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
and this video is going to go over

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,558
particle size and also texture analysis

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,759
importance in regards to a soil test

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,679
report

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,359
so first off soil texture when we're

17
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,159
looking at the texture of

18
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,519
soil well soil texture is is a

19
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,238
classification instrument

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,320
used both in field and laboratories to

21
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,839
determine soil classes based on their

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920
physical structure

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,840
a soil texture analysis determines the

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,879
relative proportions of sand

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,960
silt and clay in a sample the textural

26
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,238
class is based on the usda's textual

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,160
triangle classification

28
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,599
where there are 12 different textual

29
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,158
classes i'll

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,359
show a graph of that soil texture can be

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,840
determined using

32
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,478
qualitative methods such as texture by

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,200
feel

34
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,159
and also quantitative methods which

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,520
includes the use

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,719
of a hydrometer method knowing that

37
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,959
soil's texture can help

38
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,079
gauge the required inputs and potential

39
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,519
productivity

40
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,359
of a soil for crops and this shows the

41
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,759
the sand silt and clay particles in

42
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,200
suspension line this settle out using a

43
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,319
hydrometer here to kind of get an

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,079
idea of exactly where

45
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,599
levels that's reading and it will be

46
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,599
taken usually

47
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,438
uh very early on and then i'll let it

48
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,719
sit for about two hours and they'll take

49
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:42,398
another reading

50
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,078
and then they'll compare those two

51
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,640
readings if you want to see this

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,759
in action i have a path of soil through

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
a soil test lab

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,920
where they'll show you this exact

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,640
process now the soil triangle the

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
triangle is

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,399
used to determine the classification of

58
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,280
soil based on the percentage of

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,960
clay silt and sand notice how the

60
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,759
percentage of clay has a large

61
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,359
impact on the soil's classification we

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,919
can see that here

63
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,919
clay clay clay all these would be

64
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,679
considered a form of clay that's the

65
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,598
vast majority of this triangle

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
this is simply due to the small particle

67
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,159
size resulting in a high surface area

68
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,519
to volume ratio and how you try to work

69
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,400
this is you look at the percentage of

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,000
clay

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
on this side of the triangle with the

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,560
percentage silt and the percentage of

73
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,919
sand

74
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,039
so for example if i had 60

75
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,598
clay and i come down here and then i'm

76
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,840
looking

77
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:42,238
at we could say 30 percent silt

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,039
and then for uh sand we'd have only 10

79
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,599
sand here so where those would converge

80
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,759
would be

81
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,280
right here that would be considered a

82
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,199
clay soil

83
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,719
we could see again we have other options

84
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,399
here if we only had

85
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,759
10 percent clay and then we had 20

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,920
percent

87
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:03,919
sand we would then have to have 70

88
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,000
percent silt and that would classify us

89
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,199
as a silt loam so that's kind of the way

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,598
you read these three

91
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,238
sides of this soil triangle to get the

92
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,679
proper

93
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,400
classification now sand silt and clay

94
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
particles

95
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
alone is often classification given to

96
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,560
soil that is not predominantly

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,318
sand silt or clay and that just has some

98
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,878
a little different characteristics to

99
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:24,798
that

100
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,039
you can see clay we typically think of

101
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,640
it having a very sticky appearance

102
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,039
kind of that ability to kind of plate on

103
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,958
itself um they are in sand is kind of

104
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,679
composed of relatively speaking large

105
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,158
particles

106
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,920
that tend to fall apart from each other

107
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,399
and be independent

108
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,479
now true sandy soil has the largest

109
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,120
particle sizes here

110
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,318
and again that sand may not just be this

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
a single type of

112
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,079
snow it could be a combination sandy

113
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,959
soils though are known to have good

114
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,360
aeration

115
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,640
and drainage but a limited ability to

116
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,879
hold water

117
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,719
and also nutrients the composition of

118
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,518
sand varies depending on the local rock

119
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,280
sources

120
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,120
and conditions but the most common

121
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,158
constitutive sand in inland

122
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,200
continental settings is in non-tropical

123
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,318
coast settings is

124
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:13,598
silica which is silicon dioxide or sio2

125
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,919
it's usually in the form of quartz now

126
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,238
silt is a mid-sized particle and offers

127
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,279
properties in between sand and clay

128
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,000
silt has a moderate surface area with

129
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,719
typically a non-sticky plastic feel silt

130
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,959
usually has

131
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,000
a flowery feel when it's dry and kind of

132
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,638
a slippery feel when it's

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,639
wet silt can be visually observed by

134
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,600
hand lens exhibiting a sparkling

135
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,079
appearance

136
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
that's kind of that in-between kind of

137
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,279
soil there and

138
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960
typically a more sought after soil for

139
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,000
growing crops

140
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:46,319
loan soil loan by weight is a mineral

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
composition which is about 40 40 20

142
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,478
conservation sand silt and clay

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,918
respectively these proportions

144
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:56,399
can vary to a degree however and result

145
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,918
in different types of loamy soils for

146
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,959
example there's sandy loam

147
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,240
silty lump clay loam sandy clay loam and

148
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,239
silty clay loam

149
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,600
and loam if you notice in that kind of

150
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,680
readout there it's important of the

151
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,720
order that they're presented as well

152
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,680
to classify most precisely classify the

153
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,680
soil

154
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,840
note that the primary difference on loam

155
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,879
in most dictionaries is soil with humus

156
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,519
or organic

157
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,360
content and no mention of particle size

158
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,879
texture and this is definition used by

159
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,720
many gardeners

160
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,719
in the u.s department of agriculture

161
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,960
textual classification triangle

162
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,400
the only soil that is not predominantly

163
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,439
sand silt in clay is called

164
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,359
loam loam soils generally contain more

165
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,600
nutrients moisture and humis

166
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
than sandy soils and have better

167
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,400
drainage and infiltration of water and

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,560
air than silt and clay rich soils and

169
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,319
are easier to till than clay soils

170
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,399
they're simply called to be grocery

171
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,000
freedom as being less heavy

172
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:54,399
less likely to kind of clump together

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,918
allow water to drain a little bit better

174
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,239
definitely compared to a clay

175
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,918
and also allow better aeration of the

176
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,720
root zone of a plant

177
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,560
then we get to our clay soils and our

178
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,960
clay cells are the smallest particle

179
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
size

180
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,638
have the greatest impact on soil

181
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,079
properties the high surface area allow

182
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,840
them to hold nutrients well which

183
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,359
reduces the chance of leaching

184
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,359
sounds like a good thing however this

185
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,639
soil can hold water which can result in

186
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,759
plants being more likely to be

187
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,800
waterlogged

188
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,479
also when clay soils dries it will crack

189
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,478
and be more difficult than other types

190
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,318
to rehydrate it's a negative

191
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,000
you can tell me if true clay soils have

192
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,879
the picture here if you start at one end

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,240
of the field

194
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,279
and you walk your way to the other end

195
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,800
of the field and you're six inches

196
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,318
taller by taking it to the end

197
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
that's because all the clay builds up

198
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,120
that would be a true clay so it has a

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,839
tendency definitely

200
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
to stick together now how do we

201
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,519
determine these different

202
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,799
textures by feel well there is this

203
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,038
ribbon test

204
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,319
and go through the exact kind of process

205
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,439
here that if you want to go through and

206
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,520
read it you can

207
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,719
but you're basically placing soil in the

208
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,560
palm of your hand

209
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,479
adding some water needing that soil with

210
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,360
a smooth plastic consistency to like a

211
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,439
putty

212
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,800
and then you want to see if does the

213
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,360
soil remain a ball when you kind of

214
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,199
squeeze it if it does you go on to these

215
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,639
next steps if it doesn't it might be too

216
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,160
dry you might have to re-wet it

217
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,079
or you might be simply dealing with a

218
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
very sandy soil where it can't really

219
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,680
hold itself together make a ball

220
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,120
open it up and falls apart it could be

221
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,079
done with the sandy soil if the moisture

222
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
is correct

223
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,598
if it does form a ball then you want to

224
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,800
go to the next step

225
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,719
where you want to look at does it kind

226
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,400
of form a ribbon can you moisten the

227
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,039
soil and kind of get it to form

228
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,560
a ribbon and based on the length of the

229
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:30,560
ribbon that you can get

230
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,000
will determine the higher percentage of

231
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,879
clay so the longer

232
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,279
the ribbon the more clay percentage you

233
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,439
have

234
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,038
in that soil then you can go to the next

235
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,759
step is to feel gritty does it feel

236
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,279
smooth

237
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,800
and that can help you just do a quick

238
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,799
test in a field

239
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,319
as far as determining what type of soil

240
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
you might be dealing with

241
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,598
again this takes some practice but you

242
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,279
can kind of go through here with some

243
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,439
soil you may have locally

244
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,679
and what you may know the type of and

245
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,879
see if you can follow this process there

246
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,759
to determine the texture by feel

247
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,680
now soil texture favorable for growing a

248
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,280
loam or a silty loam by weight again

249
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,439
it's about forty percent sand forty

250
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,038
percent silt twenty percent clay

251
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,879
variants in these proportions result in

252
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,478
different types of loam and as i said

253
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,960
listen them out here

254
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,959
sandy loam silty loam clay loam sandy

255
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,598
clay loam silty clay loam and just plain

256
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,439
loam

257
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,360
so again these are different soil

258
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,279
textures but all these in general

259
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,000
would be considered at least initially

260
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,638
favorable for growing plants

261
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,519
now lastly soil texture for the long

262
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,439
term

263
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,120
assuming no major modifications to the

264
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,320
soil the texture class should remain

265
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,240
fairly consistent

266
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,399
so it's not necessary to need to check

267
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,440
each soil test grower takes

268
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,038
while you should be kind of going

269
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,919
through and testing it for ph and

270
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,319
nutrients

271
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,919
soil texture you can kind of do once and

272
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,879
that's probably not going to change to a

273
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,479
great degree

274
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,080
however when initially performing a soil

275
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,320
test for a new or perspective

276
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,120
area it's a good idea to include this

277
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,560
test

278
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,320
this again just shows again how you

279
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,199
would read that with the different

280
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,120
percentages

281
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,959
to determine your exact classification

282
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,159
of the soil assuming you don't do any

283
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,799
major

284
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,240
large amendments of any kind this should

285
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,838
stay pretty consistent

286
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
and something you should know before

287
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,519
purchasing a field or

288
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,440
growing in a field so that you can make

289
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,560
the best adjustments and know what

290
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,800
you're walking into

291
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,799
before the plants even go in the ground
