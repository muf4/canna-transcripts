1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
okay I know can be hard to teach an old

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,330
dog new tricks but in this case I want

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,769
you to get away from the punnett squares

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,750
you're so familiar and probably

5
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:12,359
comfortable with and start to learn this

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,370
fork line method see punnett squares are

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,339
represented here but this fork line

8
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:20,038
method is a very efficient way and a

9
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:22,019
great way to handle larger crosses

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,289
because in this case we're gonna use the

11
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,849
example of a tri hybrid cross now I know

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,609
you thought the fun started stopped with

13
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,130
dihybrid crosses but it only just began

14
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,870
there we're now into tri hybrid crosses

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,300
in this fork line method will make it a

16
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,820
lot easier once you fully understand it

17
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,619
so try a bit cross example we're gonna

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,409
use this fork line method and it builds

19
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,149
on withwith dihybrid crosses remember

20
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,349
the foil method where we're distributing

21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,759
our gametes here

22
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,320
so our first outside-in said in last and

23
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,479
that's how we're going to distribute the

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,948
gametes you need to be also familiar

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,259
with a monohybrid cross because we're

26
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:01,500
gonna build upon that with our tribrid

27
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,909
cross so if you want to do a try have it

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,338
cross with a punnett square it looks

29
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:08,879
like this complex mess here one try to

30
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:12,900
avoid that so our problem is a politic

31
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:16,319
plant as a genotype big a little a Big B

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,219
Big B Big C little C is crossed with

33
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:24,089
another planted genotype which is

34
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:27,478
homozygous recessive for a heterozygous

35
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,680
for B and heterozygous for C so the

36
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,509
question is what's the expected genotype

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,850
frequencies of the offspring or seeds

38
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,959
produced and hidden take a try hybrid

39
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:36,059
cross because there's three different

40
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,978
traits looking at here and again if you

41
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,560
do a Punnett square look like this very

42
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:42,209
complex mess here and your odds for

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,659
error are very hot and we want to try to

44
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,949
avoid that so step one here's our cross

45
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,469
one won't know what what seeds can be

46
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,850
produced we need to simplify the Tri

47
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:53,640
hybrid cross into three monohybrid

48
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,379
crosses hopefully not too bad the first

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,718
one is gonna involve the a allele second

50
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,129
for the B third for the C remember

51
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:01,048
punnett squares could also be used for

52
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,968
the monohybrid crosses but we're gonna

53
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,950
focus on the foil method it's a little

54
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:06,599
bit easier to follow we're looking at

55
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,989
producing the plant across in two plants

56
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,449
together so step two the expected

57
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,750
genotype frequencies now I colorized

58
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:16,030
them here

59
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,099
so if you're colorblind I'm sorry but

60
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,780
for a is going to represent green peas

61
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,539
are going to be in blue and C's will be

62
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,969
in red here so look at just the AIDS we

63
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:27,789
were just across those together we have

64
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:30,280
our heterozygous with our homozygous

65
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:32,919
recessive and a resulting Austrian to be

66
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,379
1/2 would be heterozygous half would be

67
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,869
almost I guess recessive not too bad

68
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:39,969
right - the same thing for the B's so if

69
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,700
you're looking at the B's now it's over

70
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:44,770
it's over here now we've got our almost

71
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:46,719
I guess dominant they're heterozygous we

72
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,170
cross these together in a monohybrid

73
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:53,500
cross way we would have half being the

74
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:55,539
homozygous dominant in half the indoors

75
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,280
itis C's get a little more complicated

76
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:59,500
with both heterozygous so if we look at

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,800
the C's now we cross two of our

78
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,719
heterozygous C's we have 1/4 being

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,180
homozygous dominant half being

80
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,580
heterozygous and 1/4 being almost I

81
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,159
guess recessive okay so now we do with

82
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,780
this let's go the next step the possible

83
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,030
do you know type combinations now

84
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,919
requires the pairing of genotypes from

85
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,840
all the monohybrid crosses previously

86
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,089
completed so I just took those symbol

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,129
boxes here or and progress those to the

88
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,170
next step these are the possible gametes

89
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,519
that could be in the egg or in this case

90
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,429
the pollen grain because we're looking

91
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,170
at crossing two plants together so let's

92
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,439
start the first one here we start with

93
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:37,899
are resulting from the a alleles half

94
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,750
would be heterozygous half would be

95
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,209
homozygous recessive now we've got to

96
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,900
include the B's so we bring in the B's

97
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:49,569
now half would be Big B Big B 1/2 would

98
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,390
be Big B little B same thing here

99
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:55,000
also needs to apply to the homozygous

100
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:58,449
recessive ones half would be homozygous

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,430
dominant half be heterozygous kind of

102
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:03,069
fawn along so far can flip back or pause

103
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,709
me at any time here now we're gonna go

104
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:08,229
and progress to the C's so here we're

105
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,449
including the C's now remember those had

106
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:12,699
three different ones and it was 1/4 or

107
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:16,449
1/2 1/4 and 1/4 being almost I guess

108
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:19,659
dominant half being heterozygous and 1/4

109
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:21,879
being almost I guess recessive now what

110
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,550
we need to do in order to get the C

111
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,918
genotype this reason wise is called the

112
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,520
for Klein method it's a for Klein we're

113
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:29,079
gonna go through

114
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:35,948
we're gonna just gonna work these right

115
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:39,008
across so 1/2 1/2 and 1/4 so 1/2 1/2 and

116
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,889
1/4 you'll notice 1/2 times 1/2 team2

117
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:44,408
quarters at 16th and we also carry this

118
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,930
genotype so here's our heterozygous for

119
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:49,930
a rose and right here homozygous

120
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,199
dominant here and almost I guess down in

121
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:56,110
4c here notice I did that with the same

122
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,650
thing as we carry our way through 1/2

123
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:02,889
1/2 and 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 min 1/8 and we

124
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:05,469
carry also those alleles with us here

125
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:09,490
also carry those through and we notice

126
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:13,270
we developed this nice seed genotype for

127
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,158
this tri hybrid cross it's very complex

128
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:17,469
but if you break it apart into the

129
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:18,598
individual steps you can follow back and

130
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,830
see where everything comes from

131
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:22,810
as a result getting back to the question

132
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:24,579
knowledge used to remember it what are

133
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,408
the expected genotype frequencies of the

134
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:29,620
offspring or seeds produced this would

135
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:31,329
be the expected genotypes now these are

136
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:37,569
fractions we can easily convert these to

137
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:40,060
percents 1/16 divide that one 5 by 16

138
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:44,080
times 100 if we add all of these

139
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,089
possible seed genotypes up we notice we

140
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,379
get a hundred percent which is what we

141
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:49,839
should get it's a way to check yourself

142
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:51,250
when you're looking at the end so go

143
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,198
through add up all the percentage if you

144
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,528
get to 100 percent you know you have all

145
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,900
the possible genotype combinations

146
00:05:55,528 --> 00:06:00,848
hopefully this was a relatively easy way

147
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,739
to understand the fourth line method if

148
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:05,199
not I do have another video that is a

149
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,550
little bit more simplified it follows

150
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,408
the same steps and you're welcome to

151
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,360
check that out I'll put a link in the

152
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:12,610
description along with the citations for

153
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,848
all the pictures and information that I

154
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,848
used
