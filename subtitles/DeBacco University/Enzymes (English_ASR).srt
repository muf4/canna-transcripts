1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
okay here we'll look at enzymes which

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,179
are very specific types of proteins so

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,150
we see here on the title slide art

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,629
enzyme located the dark gray molecule

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,940
here

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,650
and we have our substrate being broken

7
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:15,388
down into two end products

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,670
remember enzymes can break things apart

9
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:18,989
swell is assemble them and hopefully

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,560
this would make a little more sense at

11
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:24,268
the end of this video lecture so in

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,479
general what are enzymes all enzymes are

13
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:30,719
helper protein molecules so all enzymes

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,509
are proteins but not all proteins are

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,170
enzymes here we see a disaccharide being

16
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:40,049
broken apart with enzymes into two

17
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:42,059
monosaccharides so chemical reactions

18
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:43,949
for life enzymes are involved in the

19
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:46,339
building of malthus or the synthesis

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,020
here we have two independent molecules

21
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,230
taking an energy to form this bond this

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,550
synthesized molecule and the officer

23
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,308
that would be break down it's very

24
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,448
important we have enzymes as part of our

25
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:59,759
digestive system

26
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:03,018
tell us release some energy here

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,280
throughout the digestive process

28
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:06,989
activation energy is the minimum amount

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,359
of energy that must be present for a

30
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,519
chemical reaction to occur so here we

31
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,560
have reactants producing our energy love

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,298
our end products this is minimum

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,390
activation air this is the minimum of

34
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,360
energy we need to obtain in order to

35
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,239
produce our end products so this

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:28,079
activation energy can be greatly reduced

37
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,899
in the presence of enzymes now Cal the

38
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,310
converters relate to cars here also

39
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,650
internal combustion engines have

40
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,659
catalysts which accelerates chemical

41
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,219
reactions and there's a catalytic

42
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,320
converter the internal combustion

43
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,780
engines this helps speed up the reaction

44
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,828
that occurs to reduce some of the

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,170
emissions that are produced

46
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:51,319
now mechanisms for enzyme action aliy

47
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,460
enzyme must bind to the substrate

48
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,679
practice for metal lower activation

49
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,319
energy and the product will then be

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,270
released so enzymes important proteins

51
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,648
for living things and enzymes are

52
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:04,109
protein that changes the rate of the

53
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,868
chemical reaction they can speed up

54
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:08,610
chemical reactions allowing biological

55
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:11,969
functions to occur at a much quicker

56
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,850
rate at reduced energy allowing you to

57
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,859
be able to survive

58
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:18,389
this is a great summary slide here for

59
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,030
chemical reactions in living partisans

60
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:23,429
require enzymes to do work the enzymes

61
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,409
speed up reactions are catalyzed them so

62
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,629
let's take this a little more detail the

63
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,759
red line here shows the reactants and

64
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,799
the amount of energy required without

65
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,709
enzymes this is the activation energy

66
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,530
here without an enzyme it's producing

67
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,629
the end products now in the presence of

68
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,569
enzymes we see that the amount of

69
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,849
activation energy is greatly reduced in

70
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,280
this case not only is the energy reduced

71
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:50,699
but the time to produce the end products

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,039
is also reduced so in this example we

73
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,439
have less amount of energy required and

74
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,239
a quicker time to produce the end

75
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,889
products however we look at the

76
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,870
beginning in the end we start in the

77
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:04,049
same place and we end up in the same

78
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,210
place however her biological purposes

79
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,100
sometimes there could be too much energy

80
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,200
required and if we didn't had enzymes

81
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,900
and if we did not have enzymes we would

82
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:16,019
not be able to perform the necessary

83
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,030
functions for life so here again enzymes

84
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,159
reducing the activation energy in this

85
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,590
case also reducing the amount of time

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,819
this is the overall energy release

87
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,729
during the reaction we see that's

88
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:30,629
basically the same with or without the

89
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:33,000
enzymes now some key vocabulary will

90
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,189
region audit enzymes and these very

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,889
specific types of proteins are substrate

92
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:40,259
which are the molecule the enzyme works

93
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,579
on the end product which is what the

94
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,340
enzyme helps to produce at the end the

95
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,680
reaction in this active site which is a

96
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,500
very specific shape which allows a very

97
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,840
specific substrate to bind to that so

98
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,060
that's the active site here it'll be

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,259
different for every enzyme one enzyme

100
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,539
cannot bind to a bunch of different

101
00:03:55,259 --> 00:04:01,109
substrates and only bind to the same

102
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:03,060
type of substrate so kind of just view

103
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,030
that general progression of the

104
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,879
catalytic cycle Weaver active site with

105
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,349
our enzyme here we have our sucrose

106
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,789
which is consists of glucose and

107
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,960
fructose flying together this is a

108
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:17,909
disaccharide two carbohydrates two

109
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,269
monosaccharides two sugars bonded

110
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,610
together this enzyme has a very specific

111
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,978
shape for sucrose and it's forming this

112
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,639
enzyme substrate complex as mining is

113
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:29,279
occurring

114
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,800
then the substrate enzyme places

115
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,109
stresses on the sucrose unnecessary on

116
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,699
the glucose fructose bond of the sucrose

117
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,580
molecule and that ultimately will break

118
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,870
the bond and we're seeing that breaking

119
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,389
of the bond and that products being

120
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,149
released in this form of glucose and

121
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:47,158
fructose and here's the enzyme now open

122
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:48,448
and able to bind to another sucrose

123
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:51,778
molecule to go through this process

124
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:54,028
again again kind of shows you just that

125
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:55,889
general same progression here again with

126
00:04:54,028 --> 00:05:00,120
the enzyme a lot less energy required

127
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:02,310
and without the enzyme enzymes are

128
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,870
proteins keeping that in mind all

129
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,629
enzymes are proteins but not all

130
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:10,259
proteins are enzymes and then typically

131
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,819
end with the suffix ASE or ace and it

132
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,129
can help you identify what substrate

133
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,400
it'll break down so for example lactase

134
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:20,460
breaks down lactose maltose

135
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,549
breaks and maltose and so on and so

136
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,709
forth a malaise breaks down starches in

137
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,900
mice as a type of starch you see all the

138
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:30,120
others lipase written down lipids

139
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,978
protease breaking down proteins kind of

140
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,908
using indications if you're looking at

141
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:35,278
something that you're not quite sure

142
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:38,069
this may help you identify as a

143
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:39,990
potential enzyme it may also give you

144
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,169
some hint as what substrate that breaks

145
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:46,348
down here's an image from the beginning

146
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:48,418
on the title slide so each enzyme is a

147
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:50,968
specific help like a very specific

148
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:53,128
reaction each and then it's the right

149
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:55,110
shape for the job and this is why we

150
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:57,750
need our proteins have the proper shape

151
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,610
to perform the proper function this

152
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,348
specific enzyme binds the specific

153
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,069
substrate is able to break this down

154
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:07,050
into its individual products can I use

155
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,819
the content of a lock and a key class

156
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,460
isn't very important for the proper

157
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,110
shape to perform the proper function so

158
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,448
the shape of protein allows the enzyme

159
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,009
substrates to fit as a regular very

160
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,370
specific enzyme for each specific

161
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,629
reaction that occurs also important

162
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,639
remember that these enzymes are not

163
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:26,069
consumed or changed by the reaction

164
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,528
they're only used temporarily you can

165
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:31,408
greet reused again and again for the

166
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:32,908
same reaction with other molecules as a

167
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:35,848
result your body needs very little

168
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:38,788
enzymes to help its

169
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:40,259
many reactions that occurs so they're

170
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:41,909
able to bind break down

171
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,579
or synthesized and repeat the process

172
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,160
again and again and again the dieters

173
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:49,979
need to go through and make more enzymes

174
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,320
necessarily there's enzyme this after

175
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,240
site is a very small area of the enzyme

176
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,920
so this is our giant enzyme this is the

177
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,019
actual binding site and our catalytic

178
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,819
site here reduces the chemical

179
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,099
activation energy and this can let it

180
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:04,500
allow these enzymes to kind of move and

181
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,110
break things apart or synthesize them

182
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,649
together it'll come back in to perform

183
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,330
that function again lastly changes in

184
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:14,909
proteins environment can cause the

185
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:17,250
protein to low-cal denature denaturing

186
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,260
is losing its three-dimensional shape so

187
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,269
here we have our functional protein we

188
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,310
add heat we deem nature that this

189
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:25,740
changes the shape and therefore this

190
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,319
protein for this enzyme can no longer

191
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,910
perform proper function so shape

192
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,759
determines function if we change the

193
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,830
shape that protein can very often lose

194
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,480
its function in this possibly calling

195
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,479
this protein would denature
