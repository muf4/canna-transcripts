1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,509
okay here I'm going to go over the

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:06,209
cardiac cycle and if you haven't watched

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:09,240
the heart diagram video first I suggest

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:11,129
you watch that one before continuing

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,349
with this one also when you watch that

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,150
one develop your own diagram of the

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,100
square heart because we're going to be

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,230
going through how the blood flows

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,230
through the heart and will be helpful if

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,170
you follow along starting in general

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,699
here our cardiac cycle we have a blood

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,710
flowing through the heart and we have

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,800
our atrium at the top and our ventricles

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,469
at the bottom and we have contractions

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,770
here of our different chambers both

16
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,679
atria contract at the same time as did

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,510
this same with the two ventricles this

18
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,090
is going to push blood throughout the

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,699
heart and allow it to fill at certain

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,090
areas keeping in mind these areas here

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,890
are the valves and will be important for

22
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,210
restricting blood and directing it

23
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,480
through the heart so it's most

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,770
efficiently moved through the body so

25
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:00,509
starting with the circulation the heart

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,989
we're going to start right here in the

27
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:05,969
right atrium from here blood is going to

28
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:08,188
flow from the right atrium into the

29
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:11,158
right ventricle through a one-way

30
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:13,199
tricuspid valve keep in mind blue

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,740
typically represents deoxygenated blood

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,680
even though blood is never blue moving

33
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,969
from our right ventricle blood is then

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,740
going to the ventricle will then

35
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,170
contract forcing blood through the

36
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:28,289
pulmonary valve which is located right

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,390
here into the pulmonary arteries see

38
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,640
though it's located here pulmonary want

39
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,000
to think lungs this one is off to go to

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,680
the capillaries found in the lungs

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,310
oxygenated blood will then come from the

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,810
lungs and empty into the left atrium

43
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,600
located here through the pulmonary veins

44
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,019
so we see our pulmonary veins and our

45
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,449
left atrium located here from there

46
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,908
we're gonna move from the atrium to the

47
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,790
left ventricle that's indicated right

48
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,640
here the ventricle contracts forcing

49
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,170
blood out in a single strong pulse now

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,810
it's important to remember we notice our

51
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,240
muscle thickness our H is much thinner

52
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,520
than our ventricles particularly our

53
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,709
left ventricles the thickest muscle is

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,800
here when we pumping blood to the entire

55
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,500
body bicuspid or

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,960
mitral valve prevents backflow from

57
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,909
forming that valve is located right here

58
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,530
so this will closed causing this

59
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,870
forceful contraction of the ventricle

60
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,150
out to the rest of the body and that's

61
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,009
going to go out the aorta through the

62
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,129
aortic valve and that will prevent

63
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:33,989
backflow into the ventricle lastly our

64
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,659
blood eventually will return to the

65
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,360
right atrium through the superior vena

66
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:42,150
cava which drains the upper body and

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,680
that's located here in our inferior vena

68
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,629
cava located here and that's going to

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,230
train the lower body and they're both

70
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,370
going to go into this right atrium

71
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:52,109
here's a couple other videos you're

72
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,090
welcome to take a look at but if you

73
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,340
kind of follow through these steps you

74
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,930
hopefully hopefully can follow the path

75
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,030
of blood through the heart and

76
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,430
understand when it goes through one

77
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,039
chamber versus another keep in mind both

78
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,129
atria contract at the same time as you

79
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,229
both ventricles so keep that in mind as

80
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:13,340
you're learning about the circulation

81
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:13,340
through the heart
