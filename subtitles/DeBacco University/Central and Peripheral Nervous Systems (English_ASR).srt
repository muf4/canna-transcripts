1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
okay here we're looking at the central

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,330
and peripheral nervous systems this

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,160
image provides a good kind of breakdown

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,929
of what's part of the central nervous

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,210
system which is made up of the brain and

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,679
spinal cord and then what's made of the

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,960
peripheral nervous system that's

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,810
typically our nerves and things that

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,910
connect to the brain is ultimately the

10
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:24,299
spinal cord so that's two major

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,278
divisions peripheral ganglia and those

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,260
nerves the brain in the spinal cord is

13
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:29,939
part of the central I'm not going to

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,410
quiz you all the very specific nerves

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,079
here you can see how many and how

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,780
complex that they are because it's

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,620
responsible for this network for sensing

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,558
both exterior and interior senses for

19
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,988
the entire body so that nervous system

20
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,968
those receptors and motor effectors and

21
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:50,009
all the vertebrae in most invertebrates

22
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:52,189
so focusing first on the central nervous

23
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,539
system we see it's this association

24
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:57,448
neurons and they're located in the brain

25
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,448
in spinal cord so in kind of orange here

26
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:02,878
is representative of our central nervous

27
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:05,879
system the peripheral nervous system is

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,759
a little bit more complex in the sense

29
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,489
that it contains motor or efferent

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,430
neurons and they can carry impulses away

31
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:16,169
in the central nervous system so away

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,200
from the central nervous is this is like

33
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,460
motor reflexes those attach the muscles

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
and our brain says moving a muscle

35
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,709
it's these efferent or motor neurons

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,090
that are carrying that message in

37
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,969
contracts that we have sensory or

38
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,009
afferent nerves neurons and they carry

39
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,750
impulses to the central nervous system

40
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,709
so they're kind of these sensory

41
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,409
receptor oh the stove is hot right in

42
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:42,599
that sense is being sent to the brain so

43
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,219
that is an afferent or sensory system

44
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,349
being processed in the brain and then

45
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,450
ultimately leaving the brain is a sense

46
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:51,328
of a motor neuron to help move the hand

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,070
away from that now these neurons that I

48
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:55,109
speak of they're microscopic nerve cells

49
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,750
that make up the brain spinal cord and

50
00:01:55,109 --> 00:02:00,680
nerves and to give you an idea of their

51
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,200
size about 30,000 can fit in a pinhead

52
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,170
now this is a neuron and the nerve

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,878
impulse moves one way the direction of

54
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,969
the message will travel is from the

55
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,068
dendrites to the axon terminal so it's

56
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:16,289
going to move this

57
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:17,429
so as we see here in our arrow the

58
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,798
direction of the message will be

59
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,519
received in a dendrite sent to the cell

60
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:26,310
body down here to ultimately the axon

61
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,610
terminal at the end so that's the only

62
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,140
way that the nerve impulses will be able

63
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,750
to move through here that message will

64
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:36,298
travel in this way now that peripheral

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,370
nervous system sends information to the

66
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:41,250
central nervous system utilizing sensory

67
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,200
neurons and we can see here that they're

68
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,348
connected in different parts of the

69
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,449
spinal cord so this is why the higher up

70
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:51,479
on the spinal cords that damage may

71
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:55,018
occur the more organs it can potentially

72
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:57,238
affect and if we have high injury for

73
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,969
example C 1 and C 4 injuries on our

74
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,920
spinal cord that can ultimately impact

75
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:04,590
even normal breathing even the lungs can

76
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,328
be impacted by this so we're looking at

77
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,299
the same terminology cervical thoracic

78
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:12,090
lumbar and sacral it's the same

79
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,890
terminology used for the skeletal system

80
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,560
when we're defining the vertebral column

81
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,149
here so peripheral nerves for a

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,729
particular region of the body feed into

83
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,709
the spinal cord at a particular site

84
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:26,129
this is why I couldn't determine which

85
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,259
pain is very important for cart accident

86
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,139
or injuries where damage in the spinal

87
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,608
cord may occur that could ultimately

88
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:35,099
relate to the organs it that may be

89
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,750
affected now within this peripheral

90
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,608
nervous system our nerves are visible

91
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,250
bundles of axons and dendrites that

92
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:43,439
extend from the brains spinal cord into

93
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,939
all parts of the body for example if

94
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,489
this included in the image here some of

95
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:50,699
those cranial nerves and I'll fast

96
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:53,669
razors relating to smell and have a

97
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,099
motor in our sensory Alstom Utley

98
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,680
located here also here is kind of giving

99
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,568
that more complex area we could see here

100
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,400
our radial or ol knife you remember from

101
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:06,388
skeletal system we have our radius and

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,699
ulna these are also following a very

103
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:11,909
similar name so we know in general where

104
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,290
they're located now the responsibilities

105
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,628
of our peripheral nervous system is

106
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:19,168
those sensory nerves carry the messages

107
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:21,238
from the body to the brain this is pain

108
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:25,139
pressure or temperature it's going from

109
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,668
here we're sensing going to the brain we

110
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,149
see that indicated by this kind of blue

111
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:29,579
line

112
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:31,469
located here in contrast to that we have

113
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:34,139
a motor nerves which carry messages from

114
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,900
the brain to the body to actual respond

115
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:40,860
so here we have someone touching a

116
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:42,810
candle we have the sense of hi this is

117
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,759
hot in high heat this could do damage

118
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,379
going to the spinal cord the brain the

119
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,080
brain is interpreting that as danger

120
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,538
it's then gonna send a signal to the

121
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,038
motor neuron here to the muscle to say

122
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:56,939
move the hand and I'll turn that hand

123
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:58,889
will move away from the heat source kind

124
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,439
of putting that also until kind of an

125
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,629
image here we have our afferent impulses

126
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,360
that sensory going to the spinal cord

127
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:08,399
our efferent here coming out of the

128
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,460
spinal cord attached into the actual

129
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:14,489
muscles resulting in the movement of a

130
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:16,680
finger here or a hand just to give you

131
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,038
that idea of how this kind of system

132
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,840
works of we're having a sensory impulse

133
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:22,668
and some of the since controls isn't

134
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,829
controlled we have those kind of

135
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:27,180
reflexes that may occur and this is

136
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:29,250
occurring through the peripheral nervous

137
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,269
system it's occurring both our sensory

138
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,269
and motor nerves
