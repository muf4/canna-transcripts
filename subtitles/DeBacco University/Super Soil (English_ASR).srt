1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
okay I'm gonna describe a little bit

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,870
about what this concept of super soil is

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:08,969
and the picture here of Superman because

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,219
the idea is to create the superior soil

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,580
that's really going to help plants take

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:16,320
off and produce maximum yields so this

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,480
term super soil is very common in the

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,118
cannabis industry it's typically used to

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,039
define a quality based material growing

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,189
material that is both beneficial fungi

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,920
bacteria night macronutrients

12
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,618
micronutrients good porosity it's kind

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,300
of like the best of everything for

14
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:34,259
plants to grow in it can be a

15
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,319
combination of

16
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:40,259
recipes here to create the ideally the

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,909
best growing media for plants now the

18
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,070
advantage of super soil is that allows

19
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,069
the growers to dial in the soil type in

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,230
exact nutrient ratios

21
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,600
however with great control comes great

22
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,429
responsibility it's kind of like the

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,260
mixing table here all these little

24
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:58,259
adjustments you can go through and do

25
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,390
that may or may not make a great impact

26
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,729
at the end but that super soil allows

27
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,829
growers to have all of this availability

28
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,859
and control over some very minimal

29
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,629
conditions to very large conditions so

30
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,188
making your own super soil well skilled

31
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,469
growers will incorporate your precise

32
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,269
mixture of a wide range of components

33
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,188
they can be a combination of composted

34
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,149
manures and cocoa fibers perlite peat

35
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:20,969
moss and line

36
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,130
these sales often need a cure time and

37
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,959
we've a very labor intensive so it's

38
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:26,459
kind of like cooking I can have all

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,349
these ingredients at your disposal you

40
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,029
have this entire pantry you're trying to

41
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,699
go through and make the purpose dish

42
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,290
perfect super soil here and requires

43
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,978
when you're building from scratch all of

44
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,140
the necessary components in very precise

45
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,819
and pre measured quantities just like

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,329
putting something in the oven that needs

47
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:44,750
to bake

48
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:46,949
sometimes super soil needs time to cure

49
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,680
and making your own super soil it's

50
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,969
often a good surrealist mix will provide

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,250
the base material kind of like the

52
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:55,048
foundation that grows will then add some

53
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,618
materials to to kind of create the house

54
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,460
and then they'll add some specialty

55
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,739
sometimes what they like to think of

56
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,809
secret materials to kind of create the

57
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,000
final touches here to the room this

58
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,920
often takes a lot of time and sense of

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,120
letting it sit letting it cure and this

60
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,348
entire process is very labor intensive

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,718
super

62
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:16,399
complex recipes growers are posted as

63
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:18,169
examples all over the Internet

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,819
included two links down here to take a

65
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,369
look at you can think of creating a

66
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:25,608
super story like a recipe I want to look

67
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,170
behind what makes the best super soil or

68
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:29,750
what someone's considers to be the best

69
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:32,238
at super soil as a result many are based

70
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,000
and more field in actual science it's

71
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,259
kind of like thinking that adding this

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,938
and this can have a synergistic effect

73
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:39,229
and then they're going to add another

74
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:41,598
product and that's going to give them

75
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,949
this benefit it kind of sometimes get

76
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,679
out of control based on some of the

77
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:48,048
recipes that I've even seen also many of

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,909
these super soil recipes are a sellers

79
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:52,609
dream because growers are buying a wide

80
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:55,158
variety of products two examples as I

81
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:56,569
said links provided here just so

82
00:02:55,158 --> 00:03:00,199
something you can take a look at what an

83
00:02:56,568 --> 00:03:03,768
example of a recipe or that someone says

84
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:06,078
for a super soil may be that super soil

85
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:08,060
recipe example some growers swear by

86
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:10,790
prepackaged products such as happy fraud

87
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,590
and pro mix and these can often add a

88
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:15,039
good base material that can be modified

89
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,810
from there but they take a lot of that

90
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,228
incorporation and building of that

91
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,479
simple core porosity and those core

92
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:24,530
components out of the mix there it's

93
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:26,329
kind of starting with a good base

94
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,090
material that you can tweak or modify

95
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:31,040
from there now the whole reason why

96
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:35,000
people come up with these super soil

97
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,888
recipes is to have soil not to be a

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,169
limiting factor so we're looking at

99
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:41,540
yield can think about filling up this

100
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,099
barrel of water there's always going to

101
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:44,568
be a lower slat here and that's gonna be

102
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:47,268
the largest your plants can get because

103
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:48,978
that's the most restrictive so if you

104
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:53,449
have good light intensity temperature

105
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:55,790
co2 then odds becomes of consideration

106
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:57,439
of the next limiting factor so for

107
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:59,328
example of light is appear and

108
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,549
temperature is maximized and co2 is

109
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:03,409
great well if this soil is the limiting

110
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:06,609
factor creating a super soil will bring

111
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:09,168
that up increasing your overall yields

112
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:11,540
so the super soil can have a super price

113
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:14,060
rest of these get very expensive and in

114
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:15,888
the end products may be added that are

115
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,750
not needed or are repeated by another

116
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,370
product so you kind of get this kind of

117
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,439
diamond ring approach where something

118
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,168
looks nice and sparkly but it's

119
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,149
extremely expensive it's kind of like

120
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:28,250
planting money and sometimes

121
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:31,069
it's often wasting money which again

122
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,160
it's not good at increasing yields and

123
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:36,019
also increasing costs there when I keep

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,840
yields as high as possible with cost as

125
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,978
low as possible so it begs the question

126
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,500
is super soil worth it

127
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:44,240
while soil is important adding 20-plus

128
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,478
different amendments can be overkill

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,949
getting into the time versus money here

130
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,288
there's no perfect soil or product

131
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,389
everything has pros and cons so you want

132
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:55,189
to focus on a few key ingredients and

133
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,930
having your soil balanced and as

134
00:04:55,189 --> 00:05:00,110
super-soul is not necessarily going to

135
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,910
produce a superb plan more often I see

136
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,729
people who over add amendments to try to

137
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,250
get into more problems then essentially

138
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:08,449
that they have created themselves so

139
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,740
that's why I said starting with the base

140
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:12,500
materials especially if you're a new

141
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,329
grower and tweaking or modifying that is

142
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,220
probably a great option starting

143
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,659
completely from scratch maybe if you're

144
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,750
seeing or trying to grow something very

145
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,490
particular that might be worth it but

146
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,800
just starting off and saying I'm going

147
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,750
to build a whole super soil can really

148
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,598
cause some issues so start with a good

149
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,550
base material add some nutrients to it

150
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:33,649
as the plants respond to it learn that

151
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,319
base material and go from there and then

152
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:37,579
determine if you want to go into

153
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,560
developing your own recipe for super

154
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:40,969
soil I do not recommend you starting out

155
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,139
with that because you can create more

156
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,139
problems than it's worth
