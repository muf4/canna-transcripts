00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,120
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,399
where i'll be looking at carbon dioxide

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:17,039
sensor placement

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:18,079
at plant height for cannabis production

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,679
if you're going to be enriching your

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,919
area with carbon dioxide you need some

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,000
place to put the sensor so what happens

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,080
if you put it at plant height let's look

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,240
at that investigation here

10
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,198
first off realize that carbon dioxide is

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,558
a natural

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,399
material is heavier than air

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,399
as a result it will have a tendency to

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,039
accumulate at the bottom of the growing

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,960
area

16
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,878
just as we see here with the tanker that

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,160
had a leak of carbon dioxide we see it

18
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,238
filling the streets here

19
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,919
we can still see the tops of the cars

20
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:47,038
okay that carboxylate is here in the air

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,840
and it's going to disperse

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,399
in that manner now if the sensor reading

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,559
offset

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
so when placing a sensor at the plant

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,079
height this will typically result in a

26
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,599
reading that is most similar to what the

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,960
plants are experiencing

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,120
so you don't have to have any sort of

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,399
offset idea whether it's increased or

30
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,198
decreasing from that

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,960
reading you get is determined to be most

32
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,679
likely or an average accumulation of

33
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,519
what your plants will be experiencing

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,280
now what's the advantage of this

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,280
placement well this type of sensor

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
placement is advantageous if the carbon

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,680
dioxide injection point

38
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,280
is just below the actual sensor typical

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
set of rain tubing

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
12 inches below the sensor placement we

41
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,158
can see an example of that rain tubing

42
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,199
here

43
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,439
as well as kind of a larger indication

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,359
of that going on here with larger tubing

45
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,798
this simply allows the carbon dioxide to

46
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,640
fall and the sensor to pick

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,280
up and determine the carbon dioxide

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,200
level

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,879
that is what the majority of the plant

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
is experiencing so the reason why you

51
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,078
want it just above if this is my kind of

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,439
co2 injection point that's going to

53
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,398
actually fall down so it's going to go

54
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,000
downward direction

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,118
with the sensor just above that if you

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,640
put it just below that what's going to

57
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,319
happen the co2 is going to come out

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,040
and go right to the sensor so you want

59
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,279
to get an idea of again what that plant

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,280
might be experiencing this is why this

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,640
is an advantageous location

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,200
particularly when using this kind of

63
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,239
rain tubing which is this

64
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,439
multi-injection point around the grow

65
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,840
area

66
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,598
now what i would suggest to growers is

67
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,120
that with this mounting location

68
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,280
since it's providing the most accurate

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,360
level of carbon dioxide concentration

70
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,439
growers should target the optimum level

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,200
to maximize plant production

72
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,680
also make sure that other factors are

73
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,519
not limiting there's no need to kind of

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
artificially increase or decrease the

75
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,560
level you pre-set it at

76
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800
since that is probably what the plants

77
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,479
are going to be experiencing dial it in

78
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,040
to the right parts per million

79
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,878
that you're looking at having your

80
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,400
plants at and that's hopefully

81
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,560
what your plants will be experiencing

82
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,879
and assuming no other limiting factors

83
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,598
you should have an optimum rate of

84
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,759
delivery

85
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,439
of carbon dioxide for your plants in

86
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,439
your enriched grow area
