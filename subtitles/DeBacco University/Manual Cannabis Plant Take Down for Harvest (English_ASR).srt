00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
on this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,679
going to explore

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,520
manual canvas plant takedown for harvest

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,759
something you might be familiar with

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,678
i'll give you some tips and tricks and

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,400
to explain it a little bit more in

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,920
detail

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
here on this video lecture

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,399
[Music]

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,640
all right let's get into the manual

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:29,839
cannabis plant takedown

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,800
harvest regarding cannabis so first off

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,399
physical labor

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,840
is required so this is the kind of pro

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,920
and con to this method

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,280
is that as the name implies this

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,200
requires physically cutting down the

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,320
plant by hand and transporting it to the

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
next location

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,960
typically your drying location however

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,718
this process can be incorporated into an

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
operation that's also looking to do

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,960
selective harvesting

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
as a first step so this manual harvest

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,160
is made will take down you can also go

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,920
through do selective harvest first

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,479
and take larger plants a little bit

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,000
later so it does afford you that option

29
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,438
you can do a slightly

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,159
staggered harvest that manual harvesting

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,279
for indoor growing is likely the only

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,118
option but it is

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,200
easier when plants are being grown in

34
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,159
containers if you're growing outdoors

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
well

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,280
then if you're an outdoor grower it's

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,959
kind of like harvesting christmas trees

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,320
from the field which requires energy and

39
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,679
willingness to get a little

40
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,118
dirty as you're kind of going through

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920
close to that soil line cutting that

42
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,159
plant down

43
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,759
picking it up and transporting it to its

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,159
next location there

45
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,519
so all part of the kind of fun of the

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,159
manual harvesting

47
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,519
process now this is a very common

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,280
procedure so

49
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,719
this is nothing kind of really new

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,680
typically the plant will be cut down at

51
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,920
ground level with

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
heavy duty loppers and this allows the

53
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,759
entire plant to be easily handled and

54
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,920
limits the need for unnecessary cuts

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,680
which can take more time and also more

56
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
labor we are seeing someone going

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
through here and try doing a little bit

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,000
more of a selective harvest maybe taking

59
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,680
some of the

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,239
larger buds putting them into a separate

61
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,600
container for a separate drying process

62
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,118
there this also helps hold the entire

63
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,959
plant together for easy transport when

64
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,478
you cut the entire plant down

65
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,399
in here if you're taking a couple off

66
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,080
that's perfectly fine and then the rest

67
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,759
of the plant can be dried together

68
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,440
great at keeping everything kind of

69
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,120
collected together

70
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,560
easy for transport you don't kind of

71
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
have a lot of little parts kind of

72
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,318
missing

73
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,840
i also want to have forward thinking so

74
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:23,519
if you know you're going to be mainly

75
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,360
harvesting your crop at the end of the

76
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,640
season this may influence the variety

77
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,239
you select the plant

78
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,000
typically selecting smaller plants would

79
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,039
be preferred to allow you to actually be

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,199
able to handle them

81
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,719
you have to go through and do multiple

82
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,079
maybe cut it in half and cut that in

83
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,039
half again to be able to handle the

84
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,040
plant

85
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,639
excessively large plants may have higher

86
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,318
yields at least on paper

87
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,318
but manually harvesting process will be

88
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,238
difficult to increase

89
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,079
a chance of plant damage and this could

90
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
reduce the total end product or at least

91
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,519
the quality of the end product

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,039
so it's always good to have an idea of

93
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,200
what how you'll be harvesting in the

94
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,959
end because that may be a contributing

95
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,518
factor to influencing

96
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,360
exactly what you plant what variety

97
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,200
cultivar you plant

98
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,400
so that you can ensure that your when it

99
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,158
comes to harvest

100
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,439
you're not going to have any incidental

101
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,359
loss to physical damage

102
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,959
simply because the plants got too high

103
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,319
and only because you saw your reddit on

104
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,360
the paper oh it's going to produce this

105
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,639
much per plant

106
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,480
we want to make sure you can handle

107
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,719
those in efficient manner and you don't

108
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,119
have

109
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,080
a lot of physical damage reducing your

110
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,400
overall yield

111
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
cutting down on your total efficiency
