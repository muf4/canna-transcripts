00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,240
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,240
here we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,320
cannabis seed selection options

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,679
comparing and giving some of the pros

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,320
and cons to the

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,798
diesel seeds we are 50 50 male to female

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,120
or

8
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,198
choosing feminized seeds which one might

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,509
be the best fit for your operation

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:28,480
we'll discuss here on this video

11
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:30,000
[Music]

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,160
all right well looking at our canvas

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,799
seed selection options as i mentioned

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,640
diocese or feminized seed which one

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,799
would you choose keep in mind those

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,840
delicious seeds typically have

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,078
a 50 male 50 female

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,360
ratio at least theoretically if you're

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,399
growing a small number you might not

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,719
quite get to that

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,320
exact 50 50 split but if you grow them a

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,800
large scale typically they'll fall right

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
around

24
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,198
those even split they're male to female

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,520
where feminized seed will produce

26
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,599
generally a female plant at least over

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,280
95 percent of the time

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
so again what are the pros and cons to

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,040
these well starting with diesel seeds

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
what's the advantage of choosing those

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,840
that will produce 50

32
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,839
male or female well they have more

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,359
genetic variability so that can be an

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,118
advantage to some people especially if

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,040
you're looking at breeding and they can

36
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,879
produce pollen of a chosen strain which

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,799
might be difficult to find or get

38
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,719
particularly those or that are breeding

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,118
and they can offer more varieties to

40
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,840
select from because not all

41
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,159
strains or types have been brought into

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,799
the

43
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,640
feminized seed option there so you want

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,079
to consider those as advantages of using

45
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,680
dietician seeds

46
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,199
however there are some disadvantages of

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,040
using dietary seeds in the sense that

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,159
male plants will need to be removed

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,079
if you're not breeding and that's going

50
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
to take labor in time

51
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,839
plants have to be cared for that may not

52
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,680
produce a viable valuable yield

53
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
say we're looking at those cannabinoid

54
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,360
contents from those female flowers

55
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
you'll have to purchase more seeds than

56
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,759
you need because you have to expect this

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,079
culling

58
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,280
process to occur so those are some of

59
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,839
the disadvantages to

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,280
choosing dice's seeds looking at

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,320
feminized seeds what's the advantage of

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,079
a feminized seed

63
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,438
well vastly reduce the time spent

64
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,438
culling out male plants doesn't

65
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,959
necessarily completely eliminate it

66
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,799
but vastly reduces it if it's 95 percent

67
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,439
means 5 out of every 100 will need to be

68
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
called out

69
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,639
it's 99 percent that means 1 out of

70
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,080
every 100 rough to be called out much

71
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,919
more advantageous there

72
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,440
you can purchase a seed number can be

73
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,919
more closely match the total plant

74
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,400
number

75
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,318
if you're looking at growing 100 plants

76
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,560
you don't have to produce

77
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,439
purchase 200 seeds you can look at

78
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,598
producing maybe just

79
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,359
over that number there and cost

80
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,878
sometimes feminist seeds can be less

81
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,319
expensive in some cases

82
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,000
but that can depend on the strain the

83
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,000
variety or the availability

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
of that seed they get into the

85
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
disadvantages of using feminized seeds

86
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,719
well

87
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
there's limited strain selection options

88
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,318
that's going to reduce the

89
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,000
types that you can potentially grow you

90
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:48,878
cannot use the seeds if you're a breeder

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,280
because you're only going to

92
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,120
ideally get female plants a potential

93
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
negative impact on chemical profile at

94
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,080
least that's thought of

95
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,559
even though that necessarily hasn't been

96
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,159
always proven out and i said cost here

97
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,519
is a potential disadvantage

98
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,679
in the sense that they could be more

99
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,719
expensive in some cases but as mentioned

100
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,120
earlier that could be based on

101
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,199
availability or particular strain

102
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,640
or type that you're trying to grow so

103
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,839
again if you're choosing the seeds

104
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,518
keep in mind there are still some

105
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,439
options do you choose the feminized seed

106
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,120
route or do you choose the diocesan seed

107
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,120
route that's up to you
