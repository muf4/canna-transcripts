1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,198
in this tobacco university we're going

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,960
to answer the question

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,119
how do you create feminized cannabis

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,919
seeds and walk you through some of the

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,440
scientific

6
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:14,079
literature supporting this uh protocol

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,239
and also provide you with some of the

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,640
details on how to create the proper

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,519
ratio of silver style sulfate if you

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:31,759
want to do this

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:33,200
on your own here on debaco university

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,239
all right so let's get into the video of

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,320
how to create feminized cannabis seeds

14
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,839
well here's that reference article if

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,200
you want to look at more some more of

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,120
the details and i'm going to provide

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
just a brief kind of summary grower

18
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,959
oriented if you want to know

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,159
look at the original study this is all

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
the proper citations

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,000
associated with where the information

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,359
was originated from

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,119
so first off basics of creating

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,600
feminized seeds well

25
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,280
in order to produce all female seed

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,399
what's required is the induction of

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,439
female plants

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,599
to develop male flowers that produce

29
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,759
pollen that will be genetically female

30
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,118
why is this well female 6 chromosomes

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,920
are an x and an x

32
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,719
a male sex chromosomes are an x and a y

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,759
therefore

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,319
when a female plant which is xx is

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,799
induced to form pollen since there are

36
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,959
no

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,159
y chromosome all the resulting pollen

38
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,519
will be the xx or

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,280
female genetic type when pollinated with

40
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,280
a known female plant which will also be

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,040
xx this will result in the offspring

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,879
also being female and this is

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,960
the basics for creating feminized seed

44
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,640
now how do you induce male flowers on a

45
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,078
female plant because that seems like an

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,359
obvious question here

47
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,879
well three millimolar silver thiosulfate

48
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,118
abbreviated sds

49
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,280
was applied as a foliar spray on three

50
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:52,399
occasions seven days apart to produce

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,280
male flowers the three millimolar sds

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
treatment was shown

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,439
on four strains of female hemp having a

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,880
thc content that of

55
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:03,118
equal to or less than 0.3 percent

56
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,478
and those different strains were

57
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,599
designated cbd

58
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:10,959
hemp a cbd hemp b cbd hemp c

59
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,280
and industrial hemp so what are

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,800
some of the specifics of the study well

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,318
their materials and methods they used

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,280
rooted cuttings that were about six

63
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,878
inches high

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,439
with two shoots when foliar sprays of

65
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:24,399
the sdas were initiated

66
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,800
silver thiosulfate solutions at 0.3 and

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,959
3

68
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,080
millimolar were prepared by mixing

69
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,439
silver nitrate

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,760
with sds in a molar ratio of one to four

71
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,800
and this is per previous study now if

72
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,598
yours is kind of getting a little

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,080
scientific

74
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,878
for you if you wait till the end of the

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,959
slideshow

76
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,280
i'll show you the exact process of

77
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,920
preparation steps to make that three

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
millimolar solar silver thiosulfate

79
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,079
solution

80
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,000
and i'll walk down the steps on how to

81
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,200
do that the reason why i walk you

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,719
through the three

83
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,719
millimolar is that's what was shown to

84
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,400
be most effective in this study

85
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,639
so plants were sprayed till runoff which

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,800
was about 20 milliliters per plant

87
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,079
on three occasions seven days apart

88
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,879
being on april

89
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
30th the year 2018 for the first

90
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,959
replication and on

91
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,878
the 14th of may 2018 for the second

92
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,719
replication of this study

93
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,799
control plants receive sprays of water

94
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,560
only to act as that kind of nice control

95
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,480
in this scientific experiment

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,920
on the 30th of april and the 14th of may

97
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,679
plants began receiving short day

98
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,679
conditions of about eight hours

99
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
using blackout curtain to initiate the

100
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,439
flowering stage

101
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
so what were the general study results

102
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,840
here when we're kind of doing this

103
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,878
comparison

104
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,560
of the study results between 14

105
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:39,199
and 21 days after the first sts

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,318
spray treatment plants transitioned from

107
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,798
first flowers

108
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,719
to full flowering phase the most

109
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
complete inflorescence a conversion to

110
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,878
male flowers occurred

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,840
at the 3 millimolar sds for all hemp

112
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,318
strains

113
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,560
at 3 millimolar sds the majority of

114
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,399
inflorescence had 100 male flowers

115
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,640
and the remaining influence inferences

116
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,799
had 75 percent male flowers

117
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,639
untreated control plants or all four

118
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,840
hemp strains produce only female flowers

119
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,759
as expected

120
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,759
so just this again shows you the actual

121
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,840
numbers here shows the actual

122
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,120
percent of male inflorescence shows you

123
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,479
the different treatments again if they

124
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,799
were not treated we could see that there

125
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,679
are

126
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,639
no induction of male flowers which would

127
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,478
be expected

128
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,799
you can see the greatest percentage here

129
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,000
at that 3 millimolar sds

130
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,758
treatment so however it's important to

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,360
note that during this study

132
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,960
that male flowers that developed on

133
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,479
genetically female plants did produce

134
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,159
pollen so that's a good thing

135
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,240
however the pollen did not appear to be

136
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
as plentiful or freely released as

137
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,600
observed on

138
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,679
truly genetic male plants that's an

139
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,439
important distinction to make there

140
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,800
the pollen did produce seed which was

141
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,000
harvested germinated and exposed to

142
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,919
short day conditions

143
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and resulting plants were confirmed to

144
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,918
be female so that's a great kind of

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,279
conclusion of the study just be aware

146
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,120
if you're used to growing traditional

147
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,839
male plants while there is pollen

148
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,759
produced

149
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,560
it's going to be slightly different but

150
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,479
still can produce viable offspring

151
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,160
so it's a possible explanation for this

152
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:02,719
you know sds why is this kind of you

153
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,520
know

154
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,440
why is this showing to be effective well

155
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,038
ethylene blocking by sts which

156
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,560
absolutely is another plant hormone is

157
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,639
likely responsible for the production of

158
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,918
male flowers on female hemp plants

159
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,199
in our study this is the one that i'm

160
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:16,000
referring to that i cited at the

161
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,680
beginning

162
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,918
it's genetically believed that ethylene

163
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
blocking is extended when a series of

164
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,839
sprays of sds is used

165
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,439
compared to a single spray of sds that's

166
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,239
based on a previous study found in this

167
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,719
article

168
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,478
it may be possible to induce male

169
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,720
flowers on genetically

170
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,120
female hemp using other ethylene

171
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,560
perceived inhibition chemicals

172
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,800
but this shows here that sds can have

173
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,639
an effect and could be very notable

174
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
effect as well

175
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,759
so this what's the general conclusion of

176
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,520
this study

177
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,280
well this study demonstrated that male

178
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,359
flowers can be produced easily

179
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,198
consistently and female plants through

180
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,879
application of foliar sprays of sds

181
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,240
under short day conditions

182
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,918
overall sds at 3 millimolar was the most

183
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,439
effective treatment for producing the

184
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,240
greatest number of male flowers on

185
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,319
female hemp

186
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,918
plants we did not observe any plants

187
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,039
phytotoxicity or delay in flower

188
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,359
development which is again

189
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,279
another great plus furthermore we're

190
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,759
able to achieve 95 to 100

191
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,599
conversion male flowers for all of the

192
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,960
hemp strains produced here

193
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,800
this just shows you some pictures from

194
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,478
the study provided now you're probably

195
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,600
wondering at this point well how could i

196
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,719
create a three

197
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,319
millimolar concentration of sts well

198
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
here i provided you with the

199
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
how to exactly go about preparing that

200
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,560
particular

201
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,160
solution rate in solution now i give all

202
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,360
the information here so

203
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
it's important to probably pause the

204
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,319
video here print this out take a

205
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,559
screenshot or

206
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,840
utilize the information provided here i

207
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,000
do want to make note of

208
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,279
a kind of a key point is that as you're

209
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,478
going through and reading this

210
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:51,038
now always add the this is the silver

211
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,399
nitrate solution to the sodium

212
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,680
thiosulfate solution

213
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,839
the opposite will create a black

214
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,120
precipitate so when we're mixing things

215
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,159
getting into the chemistry it's very

216
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,918
important the order

217
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,960
that you mix things and what you mix

218
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:06,399
into what so just keep that in mind

219
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,918
also to use a 3 millimolar

220
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,758
solution here for spraying cucumber

221
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,918
plants this is what the

222
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,879
example was given for this survey that i

223
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:14,959
found

224
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,240
or the resulting study you want to

225
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,799
dilute to three million

226
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,519
solution by mixing the six millimolar

227
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,280
solution

228
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,279
with double distilled water and a one to

229
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,719
one ratio and store it in the dark

230
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,318
so this does make a slightly more

231
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
concentrated solution but then you're

232
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,560
going to dilute that down

233
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,759
to the three milli molar so again it's

234
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,079
important to go through make sure you

235
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,759
have precise ways to measure things

236
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,519
make sure everything is cleaned ahead of

237
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,080
time you don't want any chance of any

238
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,560
cross

239
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,000
contamination here spray plants in the

240
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,800
third to fifth leaf stage for terminal

241
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
flowers

242
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,439
use two light squares from the spray

243
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,079
bottle mix two applications one week

244
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,639
apart

245
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,318
this was used in a cucumber plant study

246
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,478
but as we just saw here

247
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,240
this same process and procedure directly

248
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,199
applies to the

249
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,519
creation of feminized seeds on cannabis

250
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,598
plants so i wish you the best of luck

251
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,878
and hope that this is successful or at

252
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:03,839
least that this provided you some

253
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,560
information

254
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:10,000
on how to create feminized seeds on

255
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
cannabis plants
