1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,318
nitrogen is very important to add to

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,599
plants here in debaco university

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,439
we're going to go through some chemical

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:16,960
forms of nitrogen fertilizer

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:18,160
you may want to be considering

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,240
all right let's get into chemical

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,439
nitrogen fertilizer options for cannabis

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,679
production

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,879
so there's many different types of

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,920
nitrogen fertilizer but i'm going to

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,239
cover urea

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,800
ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate the

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,879
three we see pictured right here

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,558
so first off starting with urea is it

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,920
contains 100

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,359
of uh this chemical which converts to

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,800
ammonia in several days and that's the

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,200
important part

19
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,000
is that it's a very quick conversion

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,760
it's also very

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,960
potent because it's 46 percent nitrogen

22
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,719
we're going to see that comparing to

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,679
some of the other nitrogen sources or if

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,879
you're definitely comparing it to

25
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,198
organic sources

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,079
this is one of the most nutrient dense

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,839
forms

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,239
it's hydroscopic means it does retain

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,640
water it's quite soluble in

30
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,919
water which is a great property to have

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,198
and also has very good handling

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
properties as well

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,840
so these are all great considerations

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
and why urea can be used on such a large

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,400
scale

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
typically it is used in the warmer

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,560
periods of the year

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,240
and ideally should be incorporated or in

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
some way get into the soil profile

40
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,000
because it is possible for some of this

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,840
nitrogen to be lost through the process

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
of volatilization then we have ammonium

43
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,478
nitrate

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,599
so this is a 50 blend of two different

45
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,599
types of nitrogen

46
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,359
it is also hydroscopic which means it's

47
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,719
highly water soluble

48
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,640
it is explosive if mixed with

49
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,118
hydrocarbons which is a fuel oil

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,079
as a result 94 amino nitrate and six

51
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,840
percent fuel oil

52
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,759
is basically and file which is a highly

53
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,000
explosive as a result

54
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,439
of the most of the ammonium nitrate

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,159
fertilizer that you're purchasing

56
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,559
is coated in some way that reduces its

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,640
chance of being highly explosive

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,079
though carrot does need to be taken to

59
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,519
prevent caking which is kind of it kind

60
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,158
of all piling up and sticking to one

61
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,200
another

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,118
and becoming just a solid clump then

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
we've got calcium nitrate our last one

64
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,680
here

65
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,118
and this is also highly water soluble

66
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,719
strongly hydroscopic it's really a

67
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,360
tendency to absorb water and

68
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,439
cake does provide a readily soluble

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,480
available forms of calcium ions as well

70
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,079
so you're kind of getting the benefit

71
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,959
there of also fertilizing your plants

72
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
with calcium

73
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,400
keep mind this is only 15 nitrogen so

74
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,719
that may play into it

75
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,239
and typically this is used when soils

76
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,560
tend to be a little bit colder

77
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319
particularly early on in the season this

78
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,159
can be a great option to have

79
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,679
available in case your plants are

80
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,039
showing any sort of deficiency

81
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,319
going through and adding some calcium

82
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,439
nitrate can really make them green up

83
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,238
really quickly

84
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:41,680
and forego any negative effects from a

85
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,680
nitrogen deficiency
