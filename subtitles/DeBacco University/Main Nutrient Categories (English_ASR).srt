1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
on this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,759
going to go over main nutrient

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,039
categories which important when we're

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,040
looking at fertilizing our

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039
[Music]

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,879
plants right let's get into the main

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
nutrient categories so you can be able

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,079
to understand each of these three

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,679
important categories

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,839
so the first category is going to be

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,278
macronutrients so they are needed in

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,359
large amounts and that's why i have the

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,599
picture of the elephant here they also

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,520
might be referred to as primary

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,960
nutrients these are typically the

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
nutrients that plants show sign of

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,039
lacking first as

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,119
they are needed in large or macro

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,960
amounts these are also the big three

20
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,799
numbers that are printed you'll see on

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
fertilizer labels and those three

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,199
numbers that you always see

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,359
are referring to nitrogen phosphorus and

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,640
potassium the npk ratio there and all

25
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,000
three of these are actually mobile

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,320
nutrients which is important when we

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,119
might be looking at diagnosing potential

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,960
deficiencies or issues these are mobile

29
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,359
nutrients within the plant that's our

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,359
first category the macronutrients

31
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,920
proceeding on from macronutrients we

32
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,879
then go to secondary nutrients and these

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,799
are needed to of extent from fertilizers

34
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,560
in most cases and for most plants

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,439
they're often added in other products

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,799
such as lime or organic matter so keep

37
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:21,839
that in mind that these secondary

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,720
nutrients

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,320
we might be wondering what these

40
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,920
secondary nutrients are well they're

41
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,839
typically magnesium calcium and sulfur

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,719
are those secondary needed but to a

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,000
lesser extent than those macronutrients

44
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,078
that leads us also to our micronutrients

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,680
and micronutrients are essential for

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,599
plant survival so i want you to realize

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,640
that they are essential but they're only

48
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,640
needed in small micro quantities so it

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,280
can sometimes be referred to as trace

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,399
elements and these are immobile except

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,879
chlorine is the only exception to this

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:02:00,640
so boron copper iron chlorine manganese

53
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,078
mn molybdenum as well as zinc are

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,239
nutrients that fall into the

55
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,879
micronutrient category they're needed

56
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,878
but needed in small amounts

57
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,038
then we get to lastly here talking about

58
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,919
the micronutrients common deficiencies

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,079
include zinc iron manganese and copper

60
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,719
however be aware that it's also easy to

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,280
get to toxic levels if you are to add

62
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,080
these can often be worse situation

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,598
compared to if you had a deficiency so

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,120
just remember that that we don't want to

65
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,439
necessarily be fertilizing for our

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,039
micronutrients we are seeing a potential

67
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,120
for micronutrient deficiency by all

68
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,359
means yes but keep in mind that they're

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,280
needed in such small amounts you are

70
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
going to be measuring them in very small

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,318
it should be dosing in very small

72
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,079
amounts i see a lot of growers often

73
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,238
over add micronutrients and that can

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,879
lead to toxic levels in the plants which

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,120
can cause more harm than good so this

76
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,759
understands the major categories of your

77
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,759
nutrients
