1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
here we're gonna look at the plant

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,330
hormone gibberellin now if you look at

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,679
the three plants pictured here in the

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,689
image and to kind of look at what the

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,300
difference is between them well it's the

6
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,548
distance between the nodes here the

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,660
inter known length in Gibran's do

8
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:20,250
influence the internet length of plants

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:24,118
so as we see here gibberellins or GI is

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,129
how their abbreviations short there's

11
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,129
actually more than a hundred known G

12
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:31,829
days this subscript denotes the specific

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:35,670
G a so this would be an example of GA 3

14
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,988
remember subscript is located below it's

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,780
known to be essential for stem

16
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:41,849
elongation and gibberellin or GA causes

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,010
dwarf mutant plants to actually grow

18
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,320
tall if you have a dwarf mutant in the

19
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,269
ad G A's to that you actually get that

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,359
plant to return too close to normal or

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,879
at least get taller then it's mutant

22
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:57,479
variety dwarf plants on the other hand

23
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:59,939
are often plants that lack gibberellins

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,828
and that's what causes their dwarfism we

25
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:03,899
see a very classic picture here of some

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,989
cabbage plants here's the normal cabbage

27
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,368
plants that we see over here and here's

28
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,129
ones I've been applied with GA and we

29
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:12,840
see how tall they can get how those

30
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,569
internodes between those leads can

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,159
stretch to enormous heights compared to

32
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:22,649
the normal jube realms are also involved

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,960
in seed germination G's will induce

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,890
genes to make enzymes that break down

35
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:31,739
starch initially we have our endosperm

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,150
that's our stored energy well TAS can

37
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,250
initiate the breakdown of their

38
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,560
endosperm so it can be used for the seed

39
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,780
to initially start the formation of the

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,210
root even growing up the chute to get

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,728
above the soil so two realms are

42
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:47,519
involved in seed germination the sense

43
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:49,920
of being able to initiate the breakdown

44
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,938
of that food source so that it can start

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,978
to be used to Germany that seedling

46
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:59,008
another thing G A's are used for is can

47
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,989
be the effects on grapes for example the

48
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,670
fruit development see the grapes that

49
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:06,149
are treated with GA is another very

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,250
classic picture are much larger and it

51
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,199
looks swelled up basically compared to

52
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,389
grapes that were untreated so if you

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,219
ever see those large plump giant grapes

54
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:17,599
could be a result of

55
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:17,599
the plant hormone gibberellin
