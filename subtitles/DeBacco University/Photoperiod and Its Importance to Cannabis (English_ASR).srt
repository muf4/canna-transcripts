1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,740
so when growing cannabis it's very

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:06,660
important to keep in mind the photo

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,929
period that you're exposing your plants

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,599
to when photo period is the duration of

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,669
continuous light or continuous darkness

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,009
that those plants are being exposed to

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,170
that will impact whether it stays in a

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,199
vegetative state or it goes into a

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,970
flowering state so photo period in the

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,920
general sense is described as the length

11
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:28,198
of day or a period of time the plate is

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,300
exposed to light typically plants are

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,789
only able to tell the length of night

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,850
but this is typically just assumed to be

15
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:37,759
the opposite of the day length now you

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,230
rehearse something called a long day

17
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,780
that is the same as saying a short night

18
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,519
long days of summer referred to the fact

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,219
that there are more hours of sun

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,329
exposure which means the nights must be

21
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,340
short in contrast short days are long

22
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,899
nights short days which occurred in the

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,670
winter referring to the fact that there

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,520
are less hours of sun exposure during

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,000
the day which makes the nighttime longer

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,579
typically it's a longer cooler area

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,040
especially around UConn and southern New

28
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:11,400
England good days kind of quilt next to

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,830
a campfire those long cold nights which

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,450
are short days foot appear delayed to

31
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:17,310
cannabis immersing the photo period is

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,740
critical to production because during

33
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,079
long days this signals the vegetative

34
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,989
birth or leaf production short days

35
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,750
signals flowering or blood production so

36
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:30,328
again long days any short days will

37
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,269
affect the morphology of the plant so

38
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,908
exposing cameras to the plant to light

39
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:38,219
well depending on what light the

40
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,009
cannabis plant is exposed to will depend

41
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:43,530
on the behavior that exhibits a small

42
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,899
plant will go into flower if given short

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,299
days this is particularly important for

44
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,269
those that are using artificial light to

45
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,680
make sure their timers are set properly

46
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:54,359
our artificial light and timers are

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,189
important because when growing cannabis

48
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,989
under artificial light it's important to

49
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:00,000
ensure the timer's are functioning in a

50
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:02,968
correct manner we have a way of checking

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,069
this 16 to 24 hours of continuous light

52
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:07,978
exposure will allow the vegetative state

53
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:10,228
to continue to occur 12 hours or less a

54
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:13,389
continual light exposure will induce

55
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:16,690
flowering in your plants and

56
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:18,639
in special cases so keep in mind chemist

57
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:20,530
falls into this category but if we have

58
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,139
our long days that's gonna cause it this

59
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,479
day vegetative if we get less than that

60
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:26,889
critical length we get those short days

61
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,340
in those long nights that will induce

62
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:32,019
flowering at any stage of production now

63
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,300
we've got to be careful here in this

64
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,360
sense that if we notice it's still a

65
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,219
short day but we this exposure of light

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
here I want to make sure that we're not

67
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:43,239
having any light exposure because that

68
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,238
will break up the night because plants

69
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,560
are only able to tell the hours of

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,379
continuous darkness

71
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,709
so here technically we have the same

72
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,389
hours of darkness we would think but in

73
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,189
this case we had the lights come on for

74
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:58,629
some reasons could be a faulty switch

75
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:00,939
this could be someone turning on the

76
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:03,159
lights unintentionally it breaks the

77
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:05,949
night has result these two seats

78
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,049
sections of darkness equate to this area

79
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:10,479
so the plant will remain the vegetative

80
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,760
state in the opposite will occur with a

81
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,738
long day plants this is important for

82
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,810
people in the floral industry forcing

83
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,549
things in the flower but for a cannabis

84
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,319
where you may want them to flower or not

85
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:23,290
flower it's very important that you

86
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,439
maintain or look at that continual hours

87
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:28,569
of darkness long hours until darkness

88
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,969
will induce flowering short hours of

89
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:34,060
continual darkness will keep them in the

90
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:35,650
vegetative state there's also something

91
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,449
called autoflowering cannabis and these

92
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,640
are cultivars that flower regardless of

93
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:42,849
the photo period they can be great for

94
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,169
entry-level people typically the

95
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:46,780
genetics are a little bit more limiting

96
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:49,899
but they do allow the grower not to

97
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,239
worry about the photo period that it's

98
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,670
being exposed to it can help predict

99
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,980
particularly new growers help them

100
00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:00,208
predict when to expect flowers and

101
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:00,209
harvest of their crop
