1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,180
okay here we are Explorer aeroponics

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,470
which is a form of hydroponics well it

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,839
can take on many forms

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:12,899
I think utilizing the easy clone cloning

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,210
system is a great example of aeroponics

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,190
because this is a true form and it is

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,010
used for the cloning process but this

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,410
same form can be used to grow plants for

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,970
longer term than just cloning now

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,920
aeroponic system offers the highest

11
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:27,179
performance possible think of the EZ

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,310
clean setup where we have a water

13
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,859
reservoir here we have a water pump corn

14
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,960
with spray bar creating this Jets of

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,489
water that come out and fall down back

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,679
in the reservoir and kind of recirculate

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,049
through as a result there's no growing

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,509
media used at all the plants are simply

19
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,549
supported by this phone here and in the

20
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,439
cloning operation there's no roots

21
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,538
initially and the roots will be allowed

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,299
to form here through the constant

23
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,510
spraying of water and also allows some

24
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:57,359
form of aeration of that area as well

25
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:59,218
you can see there's some recent clones

26
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,929
on the left and some older clones on the

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,759
right sometimes because this is a

28
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,680
cloning operation with no roots they

29
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,060
will start to yellow a little bit but

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,799
oftentimes once they start to develop

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,560
roots they will start to green back up

32
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,500
again now fruit sources been in a dark

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,350
road chamber that's down in here inside

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,509
this easy clone Energon nutrient

35
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:19,618
solution constantly being sprayed to

36
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,930
create a continual spray of that

37
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:24,450
nutrient solution on those newly

38
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,340
developing roots air is also present to

39
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,868
allow their roots to breathe this is why

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,500
this can become a very efficient system

41
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:33,659
here the downfall is that the risk

42
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,310
growth can limit its ability to spray to

43
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,350
come into contact with the growing roots

44
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,509
what does that mean well but as those

45
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:41,219
roots become denser and clump together

46
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,709
when it's initially just kind of one or

47
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,298
two there's a lot of area however as

48
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:48,569
those become denser and start to grow

49
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,729
one can have reduce the spray contact of

50
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:52,589
the other roots another downfall is if

51
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:55,769
the pump fails the entire system can be

52
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,840
lost so you are dependent on that water

53
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:59,548
pump they're always good to keep it in

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,460
an area where it can constantly hear it

55
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,770
or always check on it multiple times

56
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,609
during the day if possible so if it was

57
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,419
to go out you could catch that

58
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:11,189
immediately and not risk losing all of

59
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,289
your plants growing under this aeroponic

60
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:14,729
system now it's

61
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:16,590
official system for cloning as we see

62
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:19,018
here the clones also have a water

63
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,180
monitor here keeping in assessing the

64
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,489
conditions in addition to a ceramic

65
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,590
metal halide light now this is great for

66
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:27,450
cloning but often full-season birth is

67
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,759
not recommended especially for large

68
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,408
scale production facilities also the

69
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,598
system is dependent on electricity a

70
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:35,908
hundred percent of the time so that also

71
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,649
needs to be taken into consideration so

72
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:39,840
that we're not having any sort of pump

73
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,139
failures leading to the entire loss of

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,139
the crop
