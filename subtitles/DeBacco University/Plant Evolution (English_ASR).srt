1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
this video is going to cover some of the

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:07,169
basics of plant evolution and some of

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:10,199
the key factors that divide different

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:12,030
species and complexity starting all the

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,339
way of the common ancestor being green

6
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:16,739
algae and progressing all the way to

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,649
flowering plants you could see losses

8
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:22,679
ferns gymnosperms pine trees being in

9
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:24,629
between the mix there so there's four

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,948
key evolutionary advances that occurred

11
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:28,698
in the evolution of the plant kingdom

12
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,120
first is the alternation of generations

13
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:34,980
this is where the sporophyte the two end

14
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,679
component of the life cycle became the

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,169
dominant generation in all but the

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,058
earliest of plants and the earliest of

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,660
plants were talking early being closed

18
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,099
in descendant to that green algae

19
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,299
vascular tissue transports water and

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,309
nutrients from the plant body and

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,808
provides structural support it's another

22
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:54,030
key evolutionary advancement

23
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,250
another key evolutionary advancement is

24
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,840
development of seeds and this provides

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,149
nutrients and protections for the plant

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,850
embryo until it encounters favorable

27
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,769
conditions to grow in and the last one

28
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,680
are flowers in fruits this is considered

29
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,659
the most advanced plant species there

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,320
improve the chances of successful mating

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,049
and sedentary organisms in facilitated

32
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,118
dispersal of their own seeds we see here

33
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,630
our nonvascular our green algae or

34
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:21,659
mosses

35
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,670
very early in development non seeded

36
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,590
vascular plants and one of the first

37
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,019
ones to develop those our examples would

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,299
be ferns going over to conifers which

39
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,920
are like pine trees then ultimately to

40
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,170
flowering flowering plants which is

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,140
developed in those fruits in those

42
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,579
flowers this again gives you the

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,159
cladogram of kind of the basic

44
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:43,139
progression here again green algae

45
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,180
starting to boast at the base of both of

46
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,750
these going on the seedless nonvascular

47
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,220
plants going then the seedless vascular

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,769
plants that development of vascular

49
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,750
tissue to make kids see plants or

50
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:57,179
gymnosperms also you know the nice pine

51
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,968
trees ultimately going to flowering

52
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,740
seeded plants called angiosperms it'll

53
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:03,688
be more detail provided on each of these

54
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,478
but that gives you the basic direction

55
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:08,658
of the proposed evolution of plant

56
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:08,658
species
