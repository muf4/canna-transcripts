1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,298
okay here we're gonna look at genetic

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:09,359
engineering related to medicine and

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:11,190
particularly with vaccines so genetic

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,589
engineering and medicine creating magic

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:15,029
bullet so you may have heard sometimes

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,368
is what it's called - oh we just fixed

7
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:18,929
the genes you can fix the problem one

8
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,359
example of that sort of pertaining to

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:23,368
this is in diabetes the body is unable

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,340
to control levels of sugar because of

11
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:27,868
lack of insulin so here's a healthy

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,809
individual a pancreas producing insulin

13
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:32,939
when sugars present allowing sugar to

14
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,269
get put into cells and regulating blood

15
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,709
glucose levels how the however diabetes

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,450
can be cured if the body is supplied

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,670
with insulin so in certain cases of

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,820
diabetes it's just not producing the

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,129
insulin then glucose is left outside not

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,439
getting into the cells so if we just

21
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:52,409
supply insulin right we kind of create

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,939
this situation so what happens is the

23
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:56,640
gene encoding for insulin has been

24
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:59,909
introduced into bacteria through

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,250
recombinant DNA and able to get bacteria

26
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,588
to produce human insulin that can then

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,670
be added to patients and I can kind of

28
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:07,109
recorrect

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,049
especially particularly the type one

30
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:13,739
diabetes where we're having insulin not

31
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,299
being produced just as a refresher type

32
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,688
2 diabetes is where insulin is produced

33
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,368
but it lacks an insulin receptor so it's

34
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:22,559
a slightly different case why just

35
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:24,509
adding more insulin to this case not

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,859
necessarily gonna cause a fix to this

37
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,310
problem because it's a problem to

38
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:31,140
receptor okay Jake and relate to

39
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,150
vaccines this is kind of an important

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,090
one and this is a great way to look at

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,750
it so we have a virus and we're

42
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,450
developing a vaccine against that virus

43
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,530
remember antibiotics that we may take

44
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,109
kill things

45
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,840
biotic things well viruses really aren't

46
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:53,149
alive they're simply this kind of

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,250
protein coat wrapped around a DNA or RNA

48
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:59,129
fragment so the influence of virus

49
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,129
wantedly is a full house right brick

50
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:06,060
mortar windows doors foundation roof

51
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:08,008
everything in an activated vaccine this

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,330
is one type of vaccine this is where

53
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,909
they basically take the house and make

54
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,830
it into rubble 8080 knock it down

55
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:17,310
they take the

56
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,040
flu virus in this case as an example and

57
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,409
they denature it in some way they may

58
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,479
eat chocolate there's different enzymes

59
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:27,270
they might add in some ways they're

60
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,789
basically in activating it however

61
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:34,920
because it's rubble off the house it's

62
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:37,650
the entire flu basic virus just

63
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,389
inactivated in some way well genetic

64
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,670
engineering is doing is they're going

65
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:44,159
one step further this their what's

66
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:46,229
called a subunit vaccine this is where

67
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,049
they're just using bricks because we

68
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:50,549
want the body to recognize the virus but

69
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,930
we don't want the by to be a threat for

70
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,500
getting the virus and that's one of the

71
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,450
problems with inactivated vaccines

72
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,639
subunits just bricks there's no doors

73
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:00,929
there's no roof there's no windows you

74
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,089
can't really make the house out of just

75
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,580
bricks you make certain components of

76
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,110
the house we're not the full house so

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,660
this case subunit vaccines are often

78
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,120
made from isolated influenza surface

79
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,439
proteins so the surface proteins are the

80
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,319
important parts to cell to cell

81
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,500
recognition you may have heard of h1n1

82
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,319
and h3n2 these are referring to some of

83
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,780
the coat proteins to particular viruses

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,750
or two things that bricks is subunits

85
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,819
these subunit vaccines don't contain

86
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,979
broken viruses they only contain the

87
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,310
surface protein of parts the immune

88
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:37,319
system builds a response to the coat

89
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,780
proteins which would recognize anyway

90
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,719
these are the bricks gives protection

91
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,810
against the whole house meaning once we

92
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,909
have the coat proteins recognized the

93
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,430
body's immune system then can attack the

94
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,379
iris very early on the advantage of just

95
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,500
hang the coat proteins that there's no

96
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,810
actual DNA or RNA of virus contain there

97
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,870
there's no way the body can actually get

98
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:04,620
sick but we are getting the advantage of

99
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,689
a vaccine because we're upgrading or

100
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,550
building up the body's immune system

101
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,930
this gives you a little bit of idea of

102
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,290
how viruses are labeled they could be

103
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,280
pretty complex so this subunit vaccine

104
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:16,620
which I want to focus on there's

105
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,839
advantages and there's disadvantages

106
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,489
with anything but Janet engineering has

107
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,709
allowed us to create these subunit

108
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,329
vaccines and they don't contain any live

109
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:26,219
components that are considered very safe

110
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:27,490
so advantages there's no live component

111
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,099
there's no risk of injured

112
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,560
a disease if we tried to heat kill a

113
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:34,409
virus he killed all the way we could be

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,569
infecting the individual with that virus

115
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,160
safer more stable than live in 10 you

116
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,860
ated vaccines those are ones that are he

117
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,930
killed disadvantages also there are it's

118
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,050
not a perfect world on the exact

119
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:52,870
combination of those surface proteins

120
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:56,168
must be correctly identified to be at or

121
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,300
to allow the immune system to have an

122
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:00,848
effective response against future

123
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,280
potential infections there's also no

124
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:05,620
guarantee memory will form for longest

125
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,549
and future responses typically this is

126
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,459
why you have to get the flu vaccine

127
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,579
every year the the subunit vaccines

128
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:14,168
don't have quite the longevity of

129
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:16,810
actually getting infected with the main

130
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:19,448
virus however the short term in hand is

131
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,250
it may get you through flu season or

132
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:24,400
reduce at least the symptoms that you

133
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,529
may get that's a novel kind of vaccine

134
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,959
again just having the surface proteins

135
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:32,069
just the subunits not having any of the

136
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,288
interior disease vectoring components

137
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:37,779
these the DNA vaccine uses plasmid

138
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:39,519
vectors it elicits a cellular immune

139
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,799
response rather than an antibody

140
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,930
production because we're not getting

141
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,788
antibody production that's why we're not

142
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,620
getting the super long term effects here

143
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:49,360
but we are getting short-term effects

144
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,968
again forgets through that flu season

145
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,090
and it's a lot safer because rather than

146
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:56,949
introducing that whole virus live or

147
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,899
inactivated to immune system this

148
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:01,270
subunit contains those fragmented

149
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:04,049
pathogens and essentially gets the

150
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:06,250
effective appropriate immunity spots

151
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,960
this gives you a little bit again of the

152
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,629
detail of what goes on and it's a very

153
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:13,629
complex process but basically instead of

154
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:16,149
getting infected with the flu strain by

155
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:19,180
having just the coat proteins adding

156
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:23,138
those to the body and getting the body

157
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,120
to develop recognition for those it can

158
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:29,259
then attack if the real virus comes in a

159
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,418
lot quicker it's just a way that for

160
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:34,120
certain flus that are very virulent

161
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:35,829
avian flu you may have heard how the

162
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,930
vaccine was developed by the very first

163
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:39,459
unit X technique so again those Co

164
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,019
proteins are so important and that's how

165
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:43,989
it gets its name take

166
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:46,569
those non virulent portions adding them

167
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,389
to cultures and getting those in a

168
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:52,659
