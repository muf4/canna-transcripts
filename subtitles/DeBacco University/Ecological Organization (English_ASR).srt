1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,928
okay here we're a look at logical

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,869
organization and you can see that

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:09,300
starting at the very basic or the level

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,879
of the organism umbilical population

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,219
lead to a community an ecosystem or

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,780
landscape in a global view here this is

7
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:18,118
just kind of general ecological

8
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,399
organization here we're going to in a

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,509
little bit more detail now so first of

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,729
all what is ecology

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,070
well evolution in ecology are two key

12
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,018
concepts keep in mind evolution are

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,539
changes that occur in an organism's

14
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,339
traits over time over an extended period

15
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,558
of time

16
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:37,229
ecology is how the organism lives in

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,140
their particular environment so again

18
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:40,648
keep in mind separation of these two to

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,689
break apart

20
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,350
ecology that's the focus of this video

21
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:50,339
lecture is that ecology eco stands for

22
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,379
house so house and the ology is the

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,870
study of so they have the study of an

24
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,789
organism's house the greatest diversity

25
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:59,878
of life on earth is a result of

26
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,820
evolution and evolution can be said is

27
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:04,859
the consequences of ecology over time so

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,739
they do have an impact in influence on

29
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:10,079
one another as a result ecology is the

30
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,569
study of how organisms interact with

31
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,650
their environment as an example we see

32
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:18,539
the be interacting with the flower here

33
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,640
now adaptions to climate many organs

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,740
have adapted to survive in their

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,469
specific climate see here with a

36
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:29,099
camouflage also the changing our fur

37
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:31,228
coats of color of the rabbits here white

38
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,030
during the winter months to blend in

39
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:35,310
with the background and ground here to

40
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,349
represent a little bit more of the

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,769
forested kind of soil leaf looking

42
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:42,328
material here six levels of ecologic

43
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:44,519
local organization this is kinda just a

44
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:47,219
general summary slide a good one to come

45
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,569
back to to be able to refer to and see

46
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,728
if you hit all the major points because

47
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:54,089
all these are covered in this particular

48
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:56,310
video lecture populations species

49
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,380
communities ecosystems biomes in the

50
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,149
biosphere will all be touched on here in

51
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,379
a moment

52
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,030
so starting the first populations well

53
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,069
what's a population populations are

54
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,379
individuals of the same species living

55
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,239
together the demographics are the

56
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,609
statistical study of populations which

57
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,379
will allow predictions to made about how

58
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,930
a population will change

59
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,269
so looking at past data past influences

60
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,370
we can make a prediction as an estimate

61
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,219
that's how it's going to turn out for a

62
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,659
prediction on how that population may

63
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,780
change over time

64
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,879
and sometimes it's can go up and down in

65
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,680
kind of a predicted pattern here here

66
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,620
we're looking at median household income

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,520
just as an example of how things can

68
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,909
fluctuate and change or tying this into

69
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,780
populations of species living together

70
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:44,729
so what's the species that they're

71
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,110
species living together well how do we

72
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,509
define a species

73
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,120
well species are all populations of a

74
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:52,859
particular kind of organism from a

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,719
species so what's this kind of mean

76
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,170
melissa's soon as there's common

77
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,969
characteristics within a similar species

78
00:02:57,169 --> 00:03:02,339
genetically compatible interbreed under

79
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:05,129
natural conditions and sexual

80
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,950
reproduction can occur can that be

81
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:09,810
with exclusive asexual so we don't call

82
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:12,269
this with asexual organisms at how they

83
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,909
replicate or multiply this is

84
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,969
reproduction in the absence of may or of

85
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,909
a fusion of organisms so prokaryotes

86
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:23,699
amoeba and some animals plants can

87
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:26,609
reproduce with asexual means can that

88
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:29,039
it's exactly fits the definition for its

89
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,800
species here we'll thing at different

90
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,389
bird species here it needs to all have

91
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,280
common characteristics through

92
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,079
genetically compatible they can

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,969
interbreed in our natural conditions and

94
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,350
reproduce by the way of sexual

95
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:46,409
reproduction so this species species is

96
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,060
Latin for kind or appearance and Alanis

97
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,039
described species in terms of their

98
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,979
morphology you and morphology it's like

99
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,810
this shape or how they visually look

100
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:56,759
modern taxon is also considered genetic

101
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,860
makeup as a function in behavioral

102
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,500
differences when describing the species

103
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,930
a little bit more precise now I'll look

104
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,969
at the DNA aca-awesome commonalities

105
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,840
that may exist and that's how we can

106
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:11,069
kind of classify or define species

107
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,620
communities are populations of different

108
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,509
species living together so this is the

109
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,569
most system to define with precision a

110
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:21,029
community because community is a macro

111
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:23,870
system so it's a large system it's held

112
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:26,769
together by feeling and sediment at the

113
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,228
interface between society and

114
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:31,750
systems so we see the community could be

115
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:33,969
for example the school community it

116
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,800
could be the town community it could be

117
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,389
the state to be community it could be

118
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,669
the region community so that's why it's

119
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,680
difficult to define with a great deal of

120
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:43,568
precision

121
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,060
please though the consistent part is

122
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,069
populations of different species living

123
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,589
together so in the community the

124
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:52,419
populations are identified with one

125
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:54,818
another they may Accu pi common

126
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:56,829
territory engage in common activities

127
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,750
and have some form of organization that

128
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,519
provides differential functions which

129
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,529
allows the community to adapt to its

130
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,598
environment thereby meeting its needs of

131
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:05,049
its components so the meerkats can look

132
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:08,019
out

133
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:11,379
obviously a local community here

134
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:15,848
engaging in activities this interaction

135
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:18,038
between different species here now

136
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:19,839
within these communities components

137
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:23,019
include the persons groups or families

138
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,568
and organizations within its population

139
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:27,758
in the institutions it forms to meet its

140
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,468
needs so we see here where we see people

141
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,439
coming together community coming

142
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:34,509
together to build up bikes yeah see

143
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,639
community coming together here to

144
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,310
distribute food or water during a time

145
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,110
of crisis these are again are each

146
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,038
communities but they are defined

147
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,199
slightly differently now ecosystems

148
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,968
looking a little bit larger here because

149
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,610
there's a combination of communities and

150
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:53,709
associated non living factors so in

151
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,370
ecosystems and natural unit consisting

152
00:05:53,709 --> 00:06:00,370
of all plants animals and microorganisms

153
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:02,019
also including the biotic factors in an

154
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:05,439
area functioning together with their

155
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:07,418
nonliving physical or abiotic factors in

156
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,668
the environment so this is defining an

157
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:12,339
ecosystem here we have a highway that's

158
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:14,859
passing through and we have an animal

159
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:16,658
crossing passage here to eliminate the

160
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,699
need for them to kind of go through the

161
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:20,978
road system so this again they have a

162
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:23,259
small version have an eco system because

163
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:26,889
we're taking into account biotic factors

164
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:28,900
the animals and a lad factors which can

165
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:31,360
be just a physical outline of the land

166
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:33,459
there in addition we have something

167
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,000
called biomes biomes are major

168
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:40,120
terrestrial areas of organisms that

169
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,120
occur over wide geographic areas so

170
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,918
a very large scale based location of

171
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,290
each viola biome is primarily designed

172
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:49,930
by the temperature in precipitation and

173
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,819
area may receive climbs can also be

174
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,519
defined by winds rapid temperature

175
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:55,529
changes fires floods etc this gives just

176
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,779
a little bit of an idea of

177
00:06:55,529 --> 00:07:00,399
classification of some biomes here they

178
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:02,409
listed here but the key part here is

179
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,689
that it's major terrestrial areas

180
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,540
located within the geographic range of

181
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:09,610
the world and have you cannot link all

182
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,990
this together is the biosphere so this

183
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,300
is the largest scale that we're gonna

184
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,400
look at all this includes all the biomes

185
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,160
together with marine and freshwater

186
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,769
areas so the Earth's has four major

187
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,810
connected systems hydrosphere that was

188
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:25,089
the sphere the atmosphere and the

189
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,399
ecosphere all together creating the

190
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:29,949
biosphere just a portion of the earth

191
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:33,519
that's inhabited by life includes all

192
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:36,219
the biotic and also a nonliving commodes

193
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,680
or abiotic parts here so this kind of

194
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,840
ties everything together looking at the

195
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,150
very large scale go back to our first

196
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,469
slide we see that's the global view and

197
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:46,899
we worked our way all the way down and

198
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,120
kind of that organism level of the

199
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,399
population defining communities that are

200
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,530
interacting to form

201
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:57,810
ecosystems in the landscape forming our

202
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:57,809
entire ecological organization
