1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,280
here i'm going to go over bullet

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,240
trajectory and kind of a little bit of

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,240
understanding

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,400
about this even though many factors come

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,120
into play i'm going to touch on a couple

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,599
of them

7
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,638
just so you get an idea of factors that

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,199
might influence

9
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,640
how a bullet may travel so first off

10
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,278
trajectory is the path of bullet from

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,359
the barrel

12
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,480
to the point it hits the target due to

13
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,640
simple physics the

14
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,160
path will be a parabola it's going to be

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,599
curved even though we like to think

16
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
about it in a straight line

17
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,960
it's actually curved to what degree it's

18
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,399
curved depends on a couple factors

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
so we have something called line of

20
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,719
sight in line of

21
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,799
departure we kind of have this example

22
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,960
here we're looking at a target

23
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,558
and a bullet being fired now the line of

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,079
sight is it is a straight line that

25
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,759
represented by the alignment of the

26
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,000
front and rear sights of the firearm so

27
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,558
this line of sight is a straight line

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,198
the line of departure is also a straight

29
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:52,878
line but this

30
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,198
kind of runs down the center of the bore

31
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,878
of the firearm and what we're looking at

32
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,238
or comparison of how that bolt's

33
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,640
actually going to travel

34
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,679
is here's the parabolic path that that

35
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,198
bullet traveled

36
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,599
so even though it was fired here and

37
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,239
ends up here this is the line of sight

38
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,280
in this case it did have a parabolic

39
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,399
path

40
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
so it's important to take into

41
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,000
consideration the distance between where

42
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,840
the bolts leaving the barrel

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and impacting the target that's one

44
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,079
factor to consider

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,519
we also have these internal factors or

46
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,519
influenceable trajectory

47
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,359
so the projectile velocity most

48
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,000
important factor affecting the directory

49
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,719
path how

50
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,478
quick is that bullet going how quick is

51
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,560
it spinning what's the angle of fire or

52
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,118
also things to take into consideration

53
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,240
and we could see here given things equal

54
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,799
changing the speed

55
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,319
at that that bullet travels vastly

56
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,560
impacts the distance

57
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,719
having them all being fired at the same

58
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200
angle in this example

59
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,118
now external factors that effect that

60
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,560
influence bolt directory are gravity

61
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,118
drag and wind force so for comparison

62
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,519
here

63
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,159
we could see how all fire at the same

64
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,000
angle

65
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,320
we could have some different

66
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,799
trajectories and we could see some very

67
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,118
different

68
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,200
distances here so these are trajectories

69
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,280
of three objects from the same angle

70
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,280
the black object doesn't experience any

71
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,520
form of drag and moves along parabola

72
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,479
so this shows the extreme example that

73
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,719
if there was no

74
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,919
external factors kind of influencing no

75
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,000
drag i should say

76
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,119
this is how far it would travel and then

77
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
we can see here

78
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
is an example of the blue and the green

79
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
showing the impact of

80
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,840
these potential drag factors and how

81
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
they can

82
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,878
vastly decrease the distance so again

83
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,239
there's also wind force to consider

84
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,079
and we kind of see air resistance

85
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,039
nowhere resistance target height

86
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,920
so all these kind of factors play into

87
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,159
the final trajectory of that bullet

88
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,839
then we have projectile drop so the

89
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,719
effect of gravity projectile and flight

90
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,479
is often

91
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,000
referred to as projectile drop or bullet

92
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,000
drop it's important to understand the

93
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,479
effect of gravity when zeroing the sight

94
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,639
of components of a gun to plan for a

95
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,598
projectile drop and compensate properly

96
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,158
it's important to understand the

97
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,759
projectile travels in a parabolic shape

98
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,079
so i tried to show this kind of water

99
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,479
here coming out of a water pump going up

100
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,760
and coming down so when we're looking at

101
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,439
trying to estimate

102
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,518
where the shooter may have been if we

103
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,120
have the end point and we have the gun

104
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,480
to kind of match up the sights we have

105
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
to keep in mind that that bullet is

106
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,439
traveling

107
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,959
in a parabolic shape this is an extreme

108
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,680
case here

109
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,560
now the projectile drop graph just as

110
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
kind of putting a

111
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,039
kind of visual to that here's a typical

112
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,519
directory graph for an m4 carbide

113
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,840
rifle using cartridges and we can see

114
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,280
that there's two different ones utilized

115
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,799
they're all fired at the same point in

116
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,080
the same angle but we could see very

117
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,840
differences here

118
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,640
so both trajectories are identical at

119
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,560
25 meters and the difference in muscle

120
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,518
velocity projectiles gradually causes

121
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,120
the significant

122
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,039
changes so this is where knowing the

123
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,519
caliber knowing the propellant that was

124
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,919
used

125
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,840
can again help offer some suggestions

126
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,000
here as far as how far it may travel

127
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,120
in short distances may not have as great

128
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
of a change

129
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,158
but over long distances for sure that

130
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
change will be

131
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,919
definitely potentially seen at a much

132
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,239
greater degree

133
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,119
now gravity also influences so a drop in

134
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,640
bullet

135
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,158
at the same time at the height firing

136
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,039
can estimate the rate of drop so here's

137
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:10,479
one that's being dropped here's when

138
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,479
that's rolled off the counter

139
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,518
and we can see they both impact at the

140
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,159
same time

141
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,199
so gravity has the same influence here

142
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,680
whether it's traveling

143
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,759
in its line or just being simply dropped

144
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,600
of in a vertical pattern

145
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,240
so ballistics table so it's a tool which

146
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
predicts a trajectory of a projectile

147
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,879
that's used to compensate for physical

148
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,918
effects

149
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,439
in order to increase the probability of

150
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:36,000
the projectile reaching the intended

151
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,918
target

152
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,240
so these are just some basic tables for

153
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,639
looking at the wind table how that might

154
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,759
impact things drop table depending how

155
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,600
far you're shooting depending on

156
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,080
velocity depending on temperature air

157
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
pressure

158
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,478
muzzle velocity again a lot of factors

159
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,478
to take into consideration

160
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,159
i'm just kind of going over the basics

161
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,439
here

162
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,199
to kind of give you that kind of real

163
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,120
basic kind of form here the

164
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,120
ideal projectile motion and different

165
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
angles they said angle has a

166
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
large play in that so again this just

167
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,720
kind of gives this kind of

168
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,079
example of how we have different angles

169
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,479
being fired

170
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,319
and looking at different time stamps so

171
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,319
these trajectories or projectiles launch

172
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,560
at different elevation angles

173
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,159
in a speed of 10 meters per second a

174
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
vacuum and uniform downward gravity

175
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
field

176
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
is assumed so we take those factors out

177
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,959
and you can see here

178
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,720
just in general little t is time from

179
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,959
launch big t is time of flight

180
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,759
r's range h is the highest point of

181
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
trajectory

182
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,759
that kind of gives you this kind of

183
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,799
explanation of what these numbers here

184
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,439
on this graph mean

185
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
the points are at 0.5 second intervals

186
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,199
and the length

187
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,439
of their tails is going to be

188
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,120
proportional to the speed to again

189
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,000
help visualize what's going on when

190
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,319
bolts are fired at different angles

191
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,319
we also have drag resistance and this is

192
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,000
a mathematical model such as computation

193
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,279
fluid dynamics are used for estimating

194
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,279
the effects of drag

195
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,279
can get very complicated at wanting that

196
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,159
drag resistance is a factor to take into

197
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,959
consideration

198
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,800
empirical measures often offer the most

199
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,159
reliable method of determining

200
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
flight trajectories you don't have to

201
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
get super super specific but just

202
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,879
realize

203
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,879
that the drag on the particular bullet

204
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,959
needs to be taken into consideration

205
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,639
because it is a factor that's

206
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,680
influencing where that bullet is

207
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,800
ultimately

208
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,800
impacting the target
