1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
okay here we look at some of the basics

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:07,230
of packaged growing media so it's nice

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,690
and easy comes in these bags potting the

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,080
X potting soil it's a little bit about

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:14,489
what actually might be in that bag so

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,920
looking at package mixes well they're

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,618
easy to buy in large quantities and the

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,118
very efficient process typically they

9
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,309
come sterilized which is great

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,960
often contain wetting agents and can be

11
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:26,518
purchased to match specific growing

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,890
conditions so as you can see there's a

13
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:32,308
lot of benefits to going with the

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,989
package mixes route now package label

15
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,549
versus content so I want you to be

16
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:37,468
warned here that the package may stay

17
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:39,988
the same or the exterior package may

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,789
stay the same but the soilless media

19
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,128
components or percentage of them may

20
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,600
change unexpectedly so I've seen this

21
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,179
happen where you kind of buy one thing

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,320
and you get the same thing or you think

23
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,329
you're ordering the same thing and it

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,070
comes in the same package but it's

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,899
something doesn't seem right that's

26
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,000
because potentially the percentage of

27
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,679
the components within that mix may have

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,719
changed from the company so just be

29
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,090
mindful of that when you're buying or

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,900
buying the batch of that what you think

31
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,340
is the same soilless media again now

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,868
there's also the package change so other

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,280
times the package may change but still

34
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,200
the same material so it's kind of a flip

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,478
case here you see three different Pro

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,820
mixes and this is ideally the same in

37
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:20,670
site material but you can see that the

38
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,959
packaging may be very different and in

39
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,269
this case it could be the very same

40
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,379
inside material so you may get one thing

41
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:26,908
that comes in white then it comes in

42
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,399
black and it couldn't white again

43
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,500
so again just be mindful and checking

44
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,890
and knowing what the ingredients were on

45
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,150
the previous mix that you used now

46
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,739
product frustrations on both these

47
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,320
situations this can be frustrating as a

48
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,359
grower so typically buying in bulk as I

49
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,129
dive in here and when we ordering be

50
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,500
careful and watch the first run of

51
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:48,929
plants with this new material to buy in

52
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,368
bulk gives you that consistency and

53
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,829
depending on the size of your grow

54
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,989
operation which want to be mindful of

55
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:56,699
the frustrations that can occur with the

56
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,589
change in the outside or more

57
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,960
frustrations usually change with the

58
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,109
percentage or the recipe of that soil is

59
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,938
mix so media bags keep in mind is two

60
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:08,008
measured in volume so watch for

61
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:10,169
compressed vs. loose package methods

62
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,329
here this is a three point eight cubic

63
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,799
for the compressed Bale and this is a

64
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,260
two point eight cubic foot

65
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,210
so again just be mindful of what you're

66
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:21,929
buying and what volume you may need

67
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,450
because this can impact how much you

68
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,060
need or what type of end use you might

69
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:29,789
be using again the compressed bales are

70
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,219
great for large applications a little

71
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:35,090
bit harder to move smaller bags easier

72
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,620
to move less total volume of material

73
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,289
looking at potting soil so this does

74
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,840
contain soil as it says in the name the

75
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:45,060
soils do maintain composure ingredients

76
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,370
such as perlite peat moss are added to

77
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,680
improve the availability to be used in a

78
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,060
container environment this offers easy

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,430
access to good base growing media

80
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,740
provides great root penetration stable

81
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,080
often near neutral pH often drains well

82
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,510
maintains constant qualities for the

83
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,850
duration of the growing season all a lot

84
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:06,090
of positives associated with this type

85
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:08,639
of bag mix think of it as soil out of

86
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,439
the bag it often has consistent texture

87
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,599
and wetting agents to aid in the ability

88
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,000
to retain water while still aligned the

89
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,819
importance for air for those roots

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,319
debris the goals use a quality company

91
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,659
and product when you're well familiar

92
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,509
with cutting cost here will result in

93
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,979
more expenses and frustrations later so

94
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:28,259
you go kind of with that what's on sale

95
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,060
one that can affect you potentially

96
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,399
later keep in mind though that there are

97
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,229
changes within companies so just be

98
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,530
mindful when you're buying them both to

99
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:38,939
kind of be mindful of exactly what's in

100
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,599
there and to be able to deal with those

101
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:45,270
situations soil less or what's called

102
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,769
potting mixes these are very popular for

103
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,450
the value they provide they're

104
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,909
relatively inexpensive and lightweight

105
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:53,579
compared to soil and sterile out of the

106
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:54,719
bag dude they don't contain soil I was

107
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,270
just a reason why they're called soil

108
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,459
less mixes the way to retain moisture

109
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,730
and provide good drainage for aggressive

110
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:05,520
root growth and offer an easy controlled

111
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:07,590
media they buffer pH they can have

112
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,530
fertilizer and moisture to make for a

113
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,360
stable growing medium so again this soil

114
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,520
is mixes even though they contain those

115
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,410
soil can offer a very beneficial

116
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,739
environment for your roots and for your

117
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,510
plants these soilless mixes again are

118
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,889
very popular for this reason they're

119
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:24,569
commercially produced or lightweight

120
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,990
they maintain consistent air and

121
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,540
moisture

122
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,040
good root penetration drain well

123
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,020
different blends to match the specific

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
needs such as germination mixes growing

125
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:35,069
mixes even orchid blends which is a very

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,009
high porosity and they're typically

127
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:39,689
consistent in near neutral pH while

128
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,670
allowing the grower to not need to do

129
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,980
any modifications to them upon arrival

130
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,500
the advantage of the growing media's are

131
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,540
starting with clean conditions

132
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,759
consistent particles and contents as I

133
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,370
said at least most of the time presence

134
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,019
of wetting agents typically near neutral

135
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,009
pH requiring no adjustments from the

136
00:04:55,019 --> 00:05:00,509
grower ease of storage in getting more

137
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:02,029
the disadvantage of Graeme Diaz is a

138
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:05,189
lack of consistent product over time

139
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:06,719
companies can make changes as I said

140
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:07,980
sometimes they call them improvements to

141
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,510
their formulation it's just something

142
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,759
that's different it can be frustrating

143
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,110
from a grower standpoint purchasing or

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,699
shipping and storing can either be

145
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,639
potential other issues especially if

146
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,199
you're trying to buy in bulk we're using

147
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,729
the media's often not recommended

148
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,289
discarding meeting with the plans to

149
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,300
avoid carrying over disease or potential

150
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,730
pathogens which could jeopardize your

151
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,650
new or next crop her this does create a

152
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,300
disposal issues to depend on how much

153
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:32,969
you use innovating how big of an issue

154
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,790
you can have often the byproduct can be

155
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,860
incorporated into garden soil as you

156
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,170
know other means of disposal or

157
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,639
basically reusing it you're reusing in a

158
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,629
container based as wetting agents will

159
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,589
degrade over time and it's not advised

160
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:48,990
lastly we'll freeze talking about sauce

161
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:50,519
mixes well why not just use soil well

162
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,920
both offer a buffering system which will

163
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,719
be forgiving of great errors however

164
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,449
both who care a lot of time and labour

165
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,640
to move for containers so mixes are the

166
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:02,329
way to go so it's best for field growing

167
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,879
conditions soil less mixes are best for

168
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:07,919
