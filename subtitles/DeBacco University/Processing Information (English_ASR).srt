1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
okay here I'm gonna go over the basic

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:07,798
steps to process information in a

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,230
scientific sense so first part there's

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,210
kind of five major categories are steps

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,400
to observe you want to explain those

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,528
observations hypothesis testing we find

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
hypothesis repeat is necessary and then

8
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:19,980
communicate findings while they are

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,460
steps I don't want to think this reaches

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,099
a significant or set end point it does

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,630
kind of represent more of these circles

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,980
a good way to think about it where you

13
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,079
are necessarily may be repeating the

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,058
results of necessary anything get to the

15
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,859
end that may generate more questions

16
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,169
that require more observations at

17
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,988
quarter to explain those and around and

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,520
around it goes now observations do not

19
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,039
assume when you're observing just

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,230
document which you may see use your

21
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,019
senses when possible typically in

22
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,578
science labs taste is not used but you

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,520
can look at what you see which you may

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,230
hear which you may feel and I say do not

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,000
make assumptions because here we're

26
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:58,648
looking at for observing through these

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,420
cameras you may not see something that's

28
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,460
very close for example this pigeon sit

29
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,409
in there here don't assume that this cat

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,590
can simply attack this mouse there could

31
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,280
be a piece of glass between those two

32
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,700
looking at explain our observations

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,829
while not late always wait you mean well

34
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,320
you may not be always able to get to an

35
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:18,868
answer it can help generate or start the

36
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,209
thought process so developing kind of

37
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,129
sequence of things seeing other things

38
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,109
may connect trying to problem-solve

39
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,329
experience you may see bring maybe

40
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:29,009
others in initially for ideas are all

41
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,700
good ways to try to develop that initial

42
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,219
explanation of your observations cues -

43
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,290
hypothesis testing well how about

44
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,879
testing is used of stats to determine

45
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,009
the probability of a given hypothesis

46
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,048
being true or not if you perform it

47
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,118
correctly there's actually four steps

48
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,960
through this that can use statistical

49
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:51,180
software so step one formulate the null

50
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,280
hypothesis and alternate hypothesis null

51
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,799
indicates that there's no significant

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,810
differences between trial groups and it

53
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,630
can also be thought of occurring by pure

54
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,579
chance as this look like in an example

55
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,319
if I'm determining a fertilizer will

56
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:05,849
make a plant grow better the null

57
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,368
hypothesis would say the fertilizer will

58
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:09,659
not make the plant grow better in

59
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:11,520
contrast to that the alternate

60
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,620
observations will show real effects

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,650
meaning the fertilizer will

62
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,560
make the plants grow better ah step two

63
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,469
is using a statistical test to determine

64
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,189
whether or not the null hypothesis will

65
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:24,900
hold true

66
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,068
there's the main different types here if

67
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,530
you take this deaths course you'll get

68
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:30,689
into them in more detail binomial test

69
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,729
one sample t-test chi-square test

70
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:35,128
one-way Nova's things like that these

71
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:36,840
are all tests that are used to help

72
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:42,658
determine the likely or unlikely hood of

73
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:44,189
a result being true now step three is

74
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:45,568
during a p-value and it's a number

75
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,680
between zero and one that helps

76
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:48,750
determine the significance of the

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,310
results the smaller the p-value the

78
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,189
stronger the evidence against the null

79
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:58,280
hypothesis so what this means is that we

80
00:02:53,189 --> 00:03:03,568
have a p-value of 0.05 that would mean

81
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,430
95% chance that the results are against

82
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:07,649
the null hypothesis means only a 5%

83
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,120
chance of there being an error that's

84
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,039
why it's important of a very small value

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,390
and while we meet mean of calculating

86
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,259
this we're gonna understand this because

87
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:18,328
we may be looking at data or other

88
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,979
people's results and they typically will

89
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,810
include a p-value so once you know what

90
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,328
that means

91
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,949
step 4 is when you have that p-value

92
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,389
you're comparing to the acceptable the

93
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:29,608
significant value sometimes called the

94
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:31,680
Alpha value it's it statistically

95
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,750
significant the null hypothesis is ruled

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,700
out and the alternate hypothesis is

97
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,650
determined to be valid so going back

98
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,750
again to our example fertilizer making

99
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,180
plants grow better if we fall in this

100
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,250
range fail to reject the null hypothesis

101
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,250
this would mean likely the fertilizer

102
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,560
did not make any significant difference

103
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,329
here we're looking at the four above

104
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,979
that critical value looking at well

105
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,569
maybe that fertilizer in this case did

106
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,810
make a difference compared to our

107
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:59,310
control group so again null hypothesis

108
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,289
is this simply for leisure will not make

109
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,519
the plants grow better and if we have

110
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:04,229
enough data to support it

111
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,209
we may show results where that 4-letter

112
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,310
did not change anything but if we have

113
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,590
that p-value indicating the results are

114
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,659
probably not by a chance indicating well

115
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,939
we have a big enough sample size and

116
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,560
more grew better that can cause us to

117
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:20,459
reject that null hypothesis and

118
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,228
therefore it is accept our alternate and

119
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,370
when we're finding the hypothesis if

120
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:27,449
needed consider other sources in areas

121
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,519
of investigation

122
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,689
so it's not too late to change your

123
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,699
hypothesis you know when you're looking

124
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:34,680
at something other doors might be

125
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,810
opening I'm going to be fine that you

126
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,110
might want to look at potentially other

127
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,639
options as you get more data they want

128
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,600
to repeat the process if necessary it's

129
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,310
why it's important to kind of think of

130
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,590
this as it's circle even if you do get

131
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,089
to the end often the initial ideas do

132
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:49,349
not pan out so maybe necessary go

133
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:51,750
through the steps with new information

134
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,060
and develop a more refined thought

135
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,980
process there and you want to

136
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,910
communicate those findings so it's

137
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,340
important to communicate your findings

138
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,960
to others this can be officially in a

139
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:03,659
court setting or publications or

140
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,859
informally at like a local level tilaka

141
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,480
both oral and written reports are

142
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,520
required at the end written reports at

143
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,020
Pala standard scientific guidelines it

144
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,250
should be included introduction vector

145
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,159
information methods results discussion

146
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,420
and also recommendations these are great

147
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,910
ways to kind of build that community

148
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,420
take other people's ideas and continue

149
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,420
to work with
