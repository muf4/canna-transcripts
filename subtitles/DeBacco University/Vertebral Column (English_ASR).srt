1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,509
okay here we're going to be

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,580
investigating the vertebral column now

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:07,950
the picture here we may think of this as

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,250
the vertebral column and is but only

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,440
this portion the pelvis is actually also

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,449
included in this image which is not part

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,850
of the vertebral column we're learning

8
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,649
about the different sections and why it

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,359
has the curves and the aunt identify

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,839
different regions and also some

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,189
potential spinal issues that may occur

12
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,170
so starting with it's this vertebral

13
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,240
column is formed by 26 irregular bones

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,920
called vertebrae and they're connected

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,649
in such a way that's flexible curved

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,899
structure it results in the cervical

17
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,020
vertebrae are the ones on top the

18
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,960
thoracic cat vertebrae which is located

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,780
here the lumbar vertebrae and in the

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,179
sacrum down here now it's important to

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,280
have these bends and curves in the

22
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,189
vertebrae even though we may think of it

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,850
as a solid straight line it's actually

24
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:56,789
not the case

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,000
we have prosthetic concave curvatures of

26
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,030
the cervical and the O lumbar and

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,478
remember concave our lenses are shaped

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,150
like this the convex curvatures of the

29
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,209
thoracic and the sacral here's our

30
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,290
thoracic Muser sacral and that is in the

31
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:19,048
convex curve this kind of relates that

32
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,790
same image to the human body seeking an

33
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,310
idea where these are located and the

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,860
general size comparison of these the

35
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,810
reason why these curves are important is

36
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:32,780
it helps increase the strength and also

37
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,849
the flexibility of the spine here's the

38
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,560
curvature again kind of shown and also

39
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:40,319
showing again that vertebral column in

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,719
the different regions so our thoracic

41
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:47,279
vertebra located here and here's our

42
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:51,060
thoracic curve now two special ones are

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,618
what's called c1 and c2 c1 is so special

44
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,618
it actually has its own name it's called

45
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:58,290
the atlas that's the very first one here

46
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,299
it holds the head up and it's totally

47
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,689
unique and that it's considered to yes

48
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,090
join so you're making a yes/no movement

49
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:09,179
that's because of the c1 it's admitting

50
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,848
that occurs there c2 directly below that

51
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,340
is called the axis and this is the joint

52
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:16,219
between the c1 and c2

53
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,590
is called the no joy and that's the one

54
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,780
that works in this way so one vertebrae

55
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,330
is responsible for this kind of rotating

56
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,400
motion and seat one is responsible for

57
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,400
this motion the up and down the yes in

58
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,930
the no joint I'm not going to have you

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,090
identify those in an x-ray that can be

60
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,030
difficult but just remember c1 is the

61
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,769
Atlas responsible for the yes and c2 is

62
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,330
the axis and reasonable for the Dowager

63
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,099
the typical structure of upper tabrets

64
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,650
here and I'm not going to quiz you

65
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:47,030
necessary in all the details of it but I

66
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,120
do want to draw your attention to some

67
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,370
names it should becoming familiar with

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,549
prosti riyer in anterior this allows you

69
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:58,430
to orient yourself where this is located

70
00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:00,890
more posterior is totally on the back so

71
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,110
this anterior be pointing more towards

72
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,789
the center portion of the body our

73
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,829
superior view is a thing you have

74
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:09,289
straight down and again we see here our

75
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:12,110
pro sierra our true back in our anterior

76
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:14,378
portion here so again be familiar with

77
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,700
these terms so you can orient yourself

78
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:20,989
with different bone structures I'm going

79
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:23,000
to go into dissections also the discs

80
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,530
within the vertebra here we have some

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,568
cartilage and it's important that we

82
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,939
have that cartilage stack has come up a

83
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:30,348
cushion between the two discs we don't

84
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:32,840
want to have bone on bone it's to be

85
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:35,268
extremely painful we want to have that

86
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,969
slight gives there and that's possible

87
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:40,099
by the discs made of cartilage located

88
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:42,109
between the two vertebrae remember a

89
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:44,238
lateral view nor superior view that

90
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,639
should help you orient where this is in

91
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,189
this cartilage is providing padding it's

92
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,719
allowing movement within the vertebrae

93
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:54,139
so you can twist and turn without

94
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,789
feeling massive pain regional

95
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:57,079
characteristics of the vertebrae and I'm

96
00:03:55,789 --> 00:04:00,229
not going to spend a ton of time and

97
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,299
having to identify one vertebrae of what

98
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:03,768
particular region it might be located in

99
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,959
so I want you to realize that there are

100
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,609
different regions and here we see the

101
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,519
cervical vertebrae these are the ones on

102
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:10,909
the top remember are c1 or c2 or yes in

103
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,489
an hour

104
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:15,889
Atlas in our axis you can see them

105
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:18,470
labeled here again working our way down

106
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,848
our thoracic vertebrae you can see that

107
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,070
they're shaped a little differently and

108
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:24,098
they have this curve to them they're

109
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:26,509
supporting the thoracic cavity

110
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:27,168
working way further down our lumbar

111
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:28,639
vertebrae

112
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:30,649
getting it a little bit larger because

113
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,710
it gave me a more week to kind of hold

114
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:36,318
up in support and lastly at the very end

115
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:38,180
here our sacrum and our consult

116
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,189
vertebrae their very bottom here

117
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,930
they're kind of fused together and that

118
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:43,400
really independent and separate and they

119
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,158
can't really move like the other ones

120
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,198
can we have our anterior view in our

121
00:04:46,158 --> 00:04:51,348
prosecutor view so again that should

122
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,419
help you orient these types of spinal

123
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:55,248
cord injuries so spinal cord injuries

124
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,668
are catastrophic injuries that may

125
00:04:55,249 --> 00:05:01,310
permanently alter lives without 282

126
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:04,038
thousand US citizens depending where

127
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,560
that spinal cord injury occurs can

128
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,000
determine the percent of the body or

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,699
portion of the body that becomes

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,269
paralyzed the key take-home message here

131
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:16,490
is the further up that damage occurs the

132
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:18,740
greater portion of the body that becomes

133
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,139
affected so it's affected in the lower

134
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,718
region here we see it just the legs

135
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:26,629
occurs up here towards the cervical

136
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:30,139
vertebrae region it was a much larger

137
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:32,120
portion it becomes paralyzed some

138
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,129
abnormal spine curvatures scoliosis

139
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,598
might be most familiar with abnormal

140
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:40,819
lateral curve in the spine ketosis which

141
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:44,028
is a hunchback kind of look we see can

142
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:47,930
adhere exaggerated and lordosis is way

143
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:51,050
back or we have that kind of typically

144
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,509
occurs with pregnant females that have

145
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,620
this kind of odd bend to their spine

146
00:05:53,509 --> 00:06:00,800
again both of these are referring to the

147
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,490
bending looking at from the side here

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,439
we're seeing that kind of left-to-right

149
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,418
curvature of the spine that Scalia's can

150
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:11,210
be corrected here's a a brace can help

151
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:13,430
reduce the degree of curvature from that

152
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:15,528
left to right and it can help correct

153
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,439
that and allow that individual to live a

154
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:20,810
closer to normal life

155
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:23,718
lastly damage to the invertable discs

156
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,838
cause a slipped disc or herniated disc

157
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:28,610
both extremely painful and we see here

158
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:30,649
we have that kind of pinched end of the

159
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,509
nerve so never doing what our nurse

160
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:34,430
trapinch and everyone bone-on-bone

161
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,580
in this case it's going to be an

162
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,199
extremely painful

163
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:41,060
currents for this individual especially

164
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,180
occurs typically here in

165
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,579
in the lower back the lumbar spine a lot

166
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,889
of weight is applied here is a lot of

167
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:52,399
