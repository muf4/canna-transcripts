1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,040
and this debacle University video we're

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:07,259
going to go over the Hop latent viroid

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,839
background pretty extensive looks you

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,880
have a full understanding of this viroid

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,919
that's becoming more and more prevalent

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,660
and getting talked about so glad to hear

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,980
you're checking on this video here I'm

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,980
going to provide you some background

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,240
[Music]

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,580
all right let's try to learn more about

11
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,839
this hop latent vibroid and kind of

12
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:31,979
where it came from and how it became

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,200
established

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,759
so first off great research article here

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,980
it's a hot plate environment a hidden

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,879
threat to the Cannabis industry so if

17
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,159
you want to learn more information

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,320
welcome to check this as well as

19
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,659
information in the description as well

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,119
for the references

21
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,500
so this was first found in Hops and

22
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,099
that's actually where the name came from

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,079
hoplite Environ in 1987. viruses and

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,879
virates often get their name connected

25
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,619
with the plant species which was first

26
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,419
identified in and this was first

27
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:02,698
identified in hops which is a close

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,739
relative of cannabis however this does

29
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,959
not mean it only infects this plant well

30
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,939
it signifies that plant tissue was found

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,118
in it could spread to others as we've

32
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:14,819
now kind of seen 1987 it was first

33
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:18,180
report of a presence of a vibrate-like

34
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:21,000
RNA in nucleic acid preparations from

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,640
two of three commercial hop varieties

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,019
grown in Spain if you want to look at

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,780
the original article it was published in

38
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,399
1988 provide you a link there and a

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,978
picture of the first page this is what

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,500
hops look like if you haven't seen those

41
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:37,019
now this was originally called Duds or

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,578
dudding disease initially detected in

43
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:44,519
2019 California so

44
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:46,078
1987 to 2019 a long time there early on

45
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,539
it was called Duds or dudding diseases

46
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,599
of cannabis which later turned out to be

47
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,340
hop latent viroid currently helpline

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,519
virate has become the most devastating

49
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,579
cannabis disease in Kim's growing areas

50
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,618
and it's sadly it's very widespread

51
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,719
and it's actually wire spread than I

52
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:06,780
think most realized so a survey

53
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,419
conducted in 2021 by the dark heart

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,060
Nursery research that involved 200 000

55
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,339
tissues to test included that or

56
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,620
concluded that 90 percent of cannabis

57
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,780
growing facilities in California were

58
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,879
contaminated with hoplate and thyroid

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,640
however realize this is not just

60
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,979
contained to California this is only

61
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,439
where the geographic sample for this

62
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,699
survey was conducted haplate environment

63
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,318
has been detected throughout the chemist

64
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,019
growing facilities of entirely from

65
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,399
North America and probably Beyond so I

66
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,920
don't think it's just California that's

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,020
just where they did the original study

68
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,458
so why is this a concern why should it

69
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,860
be if you haven't heard about it why

70
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,019
should we we be concerned well infected

71
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,200
crops could suffer anywhere from a 50 to

72
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,640
70 percent lost in the THC content thus

73
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,639
considerably lowering their commercial

74
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,579
value and it could also affect CBD as

75
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,098
well another cannabinoids I'm sure a

76
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,540
survey conducted in 2001 again revealed

77
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:01,979
that approximately 90 percent of

78
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:04,739
cannabis growing facilities in that

79
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,439
California tested positive and 30 of the

80
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,800
plants in each facility showed symptoms

81
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,739
of this viroids infection so I think

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,620
it's a very widespread issue that might

83
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,900
be initially going unnoticed

84
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,759
so why is it called a latent viroid

85
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,519
where'd it kind of get that name from

86
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,878
well originally it was tentatively hop

87
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,459
uh viroid like RNA fast was its original

88
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,859
name since it is similar to avocado

89
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,780
sunblock thyroid but it had different

90
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,360
physical as well as biological

91
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,900
properties with faster electropheric

92
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,239
Mobility than the Hop stunt viroid

93
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,299
seventeen thousand hectares of hop

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,580
Gardens in

95
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:51,299
Germany was surveyed for this kind of

96
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,879
hop of viroid like RNA fast and it was

97
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,860
found in all of the Hop cultivars

98
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,259
worldwide testing showed the presence of

99
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,120
hoplate and thyroid in most of the Hop

100
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:02,219
cultivars again that's a little bit of a

101
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,459
scary thing we're seeing this so

102
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:08,340
widespread however since this thyroid

103
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,158
like RNA fast did not induce any visible

104
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,438
disease symptoms at least in hops it was

105
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:14,579
tentatively named hop late in the Byron

106
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,219
that's kind of where we get the name

107
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,199
that we still use today

108
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,239
the hidden disease so again we're

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,060
looking at hops here although hoplet and

110
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,579
virate infected hot plants are

111
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,280
symptomless and infection significantly

112
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:32,279
does reduce the marketable value via

113
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:35,099
yield in other Alpha bitter acids and

114
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,978
essential oil content in the Hop cone so

115
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,560
again does create a reduced efficiency

116
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,779
of the of the plant subsequently hoplit

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,300
and virus detected 90 to 100 of the

118
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:47,939
tested hop germoplasms in European

119
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,939
countries anything 90 plus percent a

120
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,800
little bit an area of concern

121
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:53,939
so what does this kind of I mean that's

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,259
again some more of the background there

123
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,180
what are we kind of looking at here what

124
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,000
was first being discovered at least in

125
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,220
Huffs there were no really found effects

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,379
which means it's present but not really

127
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,900
causing a noticeable problem in this

128
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,120
case latent is referring to being

129
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:11,638
asymptomatic meaning that it is there

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
it's present physically there but not

131
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,139
really visually noticeable

132
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,979
so we're talking about asymptomatic you

133
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,600
know what is that kind of really

134
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,240
referring to

135
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,340
um it's there but really no issues and I

136
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,100
always say that well not exactly because

137
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:28,079
even though this is the name given even

138
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,539
in hops it can cause an issue with oil

139
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,279
and acid levels affecting that final

140
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,199
crop even though it may not cause a

141
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,939
visual in your face kind of look to the

142
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,038
leaves it's causing that reduction in

143
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,719
yield also depending on the cultivar of

144
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,779
the Hops the degree to which it has an

145
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,060
impact can also vary in chemists this

146
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:47,159
virate is not asymptomatic so it does

147
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,379
show visual symptoms

148
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,360
now it can also have secondary impacts

149
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,860
so when we're looking at a plant that's

150
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,419
infected it can become more susceptible

151
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,919
to other diseases particularly through

152
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:58,439
steering wheel and powdery mildew

153
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,839
another great researcher provided a link

154
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,060
in the description here provides some of

155
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,659
these images just to kind of give you

156
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:10,019
that kind of example of how when you get

157
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,220
this viroid you can get other issues so

158
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,379
while both of these leaves do have

159
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,900
powdery mildew you can see one clearly

160
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:17,819
has it more severe than the other this

161
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:20,038
is positive for public environment this

162
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,839
is negative same thing observed with

163
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,300
fuserium which is a root based disease

164
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,799
that will then infect the xylem of the

165
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,259
stem tissue

166
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,699
now it does seem to be stable so this is

167
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,620
kind of an interesting part of this

168
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,600
viroid so overall genetic screening

169
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,000
seems to be showing minimum variability

170
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,340
across geographic regions even back to

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,259
the 1980s hot viroid has not really

172
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:42,538
undergone a lot of mutations compared to

173
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,038
what was found today now this is really

174
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:45,599
interesting because considering if you

175
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:46,918
see viroids to higher eukaryotes

176
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,139
considering the small number of

177
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,318
nucleotides it's a good thing as changes

178
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,180
or mutations can occur very quickly when

179
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,580
you have a smaller genome size your rate

180
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,199
of mutation typically is higher but this

181
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:00,719
helpline virate is showing some

182
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,060
stability other virates do show changes

183
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,440
mutations and sequences when there's a

184
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,538
host change so that needs to be taken

185
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,219
into consideration but overall at least

186
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:10,939
right now early indications of this

187
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,220
viroid pretty stable pretty

188
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:15,600
consistent sequence at least for most

189
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,639
part

190
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,919
now secondary structure for virus is

191
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,319
important because virates do lack a

192
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,000
protein coat like a virus would have so

193
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,800
a secondary structure is key to

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,019
determine its ability to infect a

195
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,400
particular host plant investigating the

196
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:31,620
secondary structure is important for

197
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,598
understanding the host viroid

198
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,399
relationship so you can kind of think

199
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,379
about this as the secondary structure

200
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,439
just the shape it's taking on kind of

201
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:42,000
like the key in the lock concept the key

202
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:43,199
changes in the lock stays the same well

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,300
it's not going to be really a good fit

204
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,699
and vice versa this is kind of that host

205
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,098
viroid relationship if there's a lot of

206
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:52,199
changes I will potentially make it more

207
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:54,060
virulent or particularly potentially

208
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,879
less virulent

209
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,098
now we have also sequence variation so

210
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,019
hoplet and virate species isolate from

211
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,219
Hops and this is all kind of provided

212
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:03,719
here in Jing bank with the account

213
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,639
number and the numbers if you want to go

214
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,620
back and take a look at it yourself and

215
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,180
all the hopalite envirate sequences are

216
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,098
isolated from cannabis plants were

217
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,280
compared so kind of what the information

218
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:16,680
we have taking that comparing it all the

219
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,839
hopplate and viroid sequences isolated

220
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,660
from Kim's plants that are available in

221
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,698
the ncbi were retrieved it's kind of

222
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,460
kind of look at it yourself only the

223
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,860
full length sequences 250 nucleotides

224
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,598
was considered for this analysis that's

225
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,658
going to be presented

226
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,038
the others can one in can two two

227
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:36,838
distinctive Hot Plate environment

228
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,580
isolates and got the exact numbers and

229
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,020
Coatings right here now they're not

230
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,639
bacteria I just put bacterial images

231
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,199
here we talk about isolates this is kind

232
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,580
of what we think of but we're talking

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,759
about something that can only be seen

234
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,040
with a electron microscope now for can

235
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,620
one 100 sequence similarity to the hub

236
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,980
latent viroid type species it's a good

237
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:58,860
thing can two had one mismatch meaning

238
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:03,539
had a point mutation at the nucleotide

239
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:06,120
number 225 so 225 Catos nucleotides

240
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:08,939
there's a mutation there with the uracil

241
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,220
mutated to the adenine as compared to

242
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,060
the haplantvaroid type species and this

243
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,639
was referred to as u225a

244
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:19,979
can two isolate was 100 identical to hop

245
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,500
late and fired isolate retrieved from a

246
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,139
commercial hop Garden in China and it

247
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,899
can kind of have that example of that

248
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:29,519
matching there on the sequence basis

249
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,679
so where these isolates actually been

250
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,980
found well they've actually been found

251
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,500
uh in Delta County Colorado was found to

252
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,539
be 100 similar to can one isolate can

253
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,820
two matched with hoplet and violet

254
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:44,159
isolated in both Santa Barbara

255
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,379
California as well as Boulder counties

256
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,360
in Colorado so just give you that little

257
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:51,299
kind of idea here we're looking at this

258
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,459
area here and then in two counties here

259
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,500
in Colorado this indicates the presence

260
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:57,419
of at least two hoping vibrated sequence

261
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,820
variants impacting cannabis but we're

262
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,620
not going much beyond that

263
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,100
so just lastly I just want to talk about

264
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,560
that um u225a the single nucleotide

265
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,459
change did not affect the structure of

266
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:14,219
the Cantu isolate as compared to that of

267
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:16,379
the type species note this change is

268
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,480
located within the lower pathogenicity

269
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:19,860
domain so it's kind of a good thing

270
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,080
again it's not going to really change

271
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,519
the virulence there this is a little bit

272
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,800
more detail than you may want but that

273
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,299
is the secondary structure a boxed

274
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,939
region here is the terminal conservative

275
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:34,559
hairpin and Central conserved regions

276
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,540
there so Arrow indicates the u225a point

277
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:38,759
mutation see again that you're still

278
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:40,259
going to adenine observing the hoplite

279
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,480
environment isolate from a commercial

280
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:44,578
hop Garden in China so we can see again

281
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,700
not a lot of you know sequences this is

282
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:50,939
very small compared to other genomes of

283
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,440
bacteria eukaryotes and even viruses but

284
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,720
there's that little mutation not really

285
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,579
increasing the pathogenicity showing a

286
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,040
very stable viroid giving us something

287
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:00,899
we can hopefully be able to Target and

288
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,620
attack without dealing with a whole lot

289
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,620
of variance
