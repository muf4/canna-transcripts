1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,528
okay so here I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,839
ceramic metal halide light cmh grow

3
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:10,439
lights we see two picture right here and

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,320
just a little bit of describing them and

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,339
what they're typically used for so

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,920
that's right but the highlights they

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:19,920
come in two wattage is 315 to be a

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,220
single bulb and at 630 well basically be

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,260
to 315 watt in the same fixture these

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:29,129
are ceramic arc tube which is stronger

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,009
and degrades slower despite operating at

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,589
greater pressures typical HID lights use

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,020
quartz which is weaker so the ceramic

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,700
metal halide is much improved over even

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,820
a high pressure sodium or a regular

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,770
middle key light the beneficial for the

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,899
vegetative birth process and they offer

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,780
a broad spectrum a nice white light

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,609
that's efficient compared to other

20
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,189
high-intensity discharge lights and they

21
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,878
also have bulbs that will last longer

22
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:59,909
than your typical HID lights due to all

23
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,189
these reasons and then some ceramic

24
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,959
metal halides are gaining popularity

25
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:06,060
amongst growers and you can kind of see

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,200
why with all the benefits that they do

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,549
offer in addition they've run cooler and

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,189
they offer many benefits over

29
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,979
fluorescence or t5 lights that are

30
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,478
considered to be their new replacement

31
00:01:15,978 --> 00:01:20,879
so instead of buying a bunch of long

32
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,269
kind of fluorescent tubes buying one

33
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,640
Cermak metal halide can suffice that and

34
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,828
just make it a lot easier to keep track

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,049
of and overall be cheaper to run in the

36
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,908
long term so Rick middle highlights

37
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,229
produce greater output in a grower only

38
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,329
needs to have to worry about one bulb

39
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,719
and it's a long life compared to

40
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:42,118
fluorescents this is a small propagation

41
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,828
tent that I have it's a 2x2 you can see

42
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,200
I have a ceramic metal halide inserted

43
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:48,269
here below here I have an easy clone and

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,340
there's my monitor there this instead of

45
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:52,140
trying to change out all the t5 lights

46
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,719
or worry about them to fit in a small

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,879
area I simply can take this one fixture

48
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,340
and be good to go this is also dimmable

49
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,658
which is great the philips master color

50
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,890
is considered to be the standard bulb

51
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,600
for this type of light and it really is

52
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,340
kind of the industry standard even

53
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,848
though you will pay more for it you do

54
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,620
get what you pay for in this instance so

55
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,889
ceramic metal halides a wall favorite

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,840
for the

57
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,549
vegetative stage they can also be used

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,560
in combination with high pressure sodium

59
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,840
stirring flowering to help increase the

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,719
spectrum the plants are exposed to and

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,909
it does admit some UV light so we could

62
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,409
see here's a ceramic metal halide and

63
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,049
here's a high pressure sodium and I kind

64
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,129
of intermix down here now we see the

65
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,630
definitely the yellowing of the

66
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,060
overpowering of the I brush or sodium's

67
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,969
but having an increased spectrum can

68
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,250
help improve the quality and the

69
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:44,550
cannabinoids that the plants may produce

70
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,659
in the end the Adventists distract metal

71
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,580
halide so they have a low wattage

72
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,189
consumption as I said through in 15 or

73
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,200
630 watts they reduced heat generation

74
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:53,729
great for early stages you'll plant

75
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,750
earth and their full spectrum white

76
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:56,969
light that they produce

77
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,050
however the downfall is they often need

78
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,859
to be supplemented with high pressure

79
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:04,800
sodium during flowering phases an

80
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,290
example here is the deluxe which ships

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,180
with the bulb you do have to install it

82
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:12,209
it's dimmable as we can see here we can

83
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,069
rotate down and change the wattages runs

84
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,379
very cool and efficient it's a low

85
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,989
profile and as a result can be used in

86
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,569
place of t5 of fluorescents and also

87
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,480
used during the vegetative stage the

88
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:27,209
reflector is about 98% efficient so

89
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,859
there's a lot of advantages with ceramic

90
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,049
the highlights in general and in

91
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,500
particular these dipped in the box it

92
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,239
was a great example of a lot of the

93
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,759
benefits that Sorrento highlights offer

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,250
in maximizing those benefits with that

95
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:43,250
low profile in dimmable qualities
