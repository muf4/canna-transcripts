00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,799
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,278
going to handle the often controversial

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,919
properly naming of cannabis and how we

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,919
should go about that

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,839
[Music]

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,079
all right let's get into properly naming

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,000
cannabis or really any plant

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,038
so first off it's often ash we use the

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,278
term strain or variety or sativa or

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,599
indica or hybrid or something else and

11
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,759
really all the both terms are inaccurate

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,238
really cultivar is what should be used

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,000
because this is a cultivated variety so

14
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,399
cultiva as far as we're looking at that

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,920
cultivars kind of how we're getting that

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,879
we want to be sure we're using the right

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,200
tool for the job and this is the proper

18
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,799
way to go about naming plants that's

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,480
been established

20
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,640
now just taking another plant as an

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,479
example for example an apple here

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,039
the macintosh apple

23
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:57,359
we can see here that should proper

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,000
scientific names i should usually be

25
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,558
italicized as far as the botanical name

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,198
for all eating apples macintosh between

27
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:07,920
single quote quote marks in roman

28
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,560
letters is the cultivar name so here we

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
could see malice palmia and then we have

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
the macintosh this name helps

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,719
distinguish it from the hundreds of

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,600
other cultivars of apples so this same

33
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,679
concept botanically should be also

34
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,759
applied to cannabis now sadly it's not

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,400
really being applied in this way but at

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,599
least this would be the proper way to

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,240
name this

38
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,839
so word of caution just in general

39
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,118
contrary to what you may have heard the

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,840
distinctions between the different

41
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,759
varieties is genetically debated

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,159
differences in morphologies are the main

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,680
source of classification with many new

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
cross breeding occurring there's been

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,720
mixing types leading to the blurring

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,719
between the two groups so for example

47
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,280
this leaf morphology

48
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,280
has a strong sativa indication

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,000
where this one right below me

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,359
has more of an indica kind of morphology

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,040
but keep in mind with the hybrids and

52
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,359
the breeding that's occurring you can

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
get sometimes a blending or a mixing of

54
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,560
the two quite often

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
even though we might just look at this

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
quick image and say oh yeah sativa and

57
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,359
indica

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,840
might be more to it than just that

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
so that requires that genetic testing so

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,159
the is work in progress a library of

61
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,280
different genetics there's no clear link

62
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,120
between plant morphology and

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,680
cannabinoids produced this is another

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,400
important distinction that just because

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,719
we see an indica or sativa name we can't

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
automatically associate a certain amount

67
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,519
of cannabinoids or terpenes with that

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,200
variety with that cultivar if you will

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,599
so as a result

70
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,518
we need to be aware of the differences

71
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,799
that occur the hybrids that occur we

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,159
have to look more at the chemical

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,400
profile

74
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,799
and not just indica or sativa when we're

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,319
talking about cannabis as is so often

76
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,160
done

77
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,238
now name is sometimes meaningless

78
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,318
another issue is consistency among the

79
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,159
varieties people will purchase the same

80
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,318
variety from two different shops with

81
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,079
vastly different effects this is because

82
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,238
the lack of our current genetic

83
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,480
screening and also checking to help

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,878
ensure consistency this is part of the

85
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,439
issues with cannabis is that lack of

86
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,959
consistency on many fronts

87
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,639
so the general classification of

88
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,878
cannabis as we can see here canvas is

89
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,279
classified as cannabis sativa regardless

90
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,318
of its origin however it can be further

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,000
classified into three main

92
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,919
classifications the sativa the indica or

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,719
the rhodalus

94
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,280
so

95
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,759
the reuteralis is the autoflowers so

96
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,239
those are going to flower based on

97
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,679
day old not photoperiod and we have our

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,439
indicas and our sativa which are

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
photoperiod dependent and if you give a

100
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,039
general kind of morphology of the leaf

101
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,719
and plant structure you can see that

102
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,798
here so hopefully this kind of gives you

103
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,799
an idea of how to properly classify and

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,799
name a cannabis even though it may not

105
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,799
be the current system that is being

106
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,799
utilized
