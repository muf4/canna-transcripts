00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
here on debaco university i'm going to

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,369
provide a brief overview

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:09,058
of reverse osmosis

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,059
[Music]

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,600
let's look at reverse osmosis use for

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,160
cannabis production

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,039
well first off the basics of the reverse

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,760
osmosis

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,760
system well reverse osmosis is a

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,560
filtration system it's a method that can

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,160
remove

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:32,879
up to 95 to 99 of dissolved salts

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,759
in any water sample as a result is the

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,239
most common

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,119
option for desalinating water on a large

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,359
scale

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,479
reverse osmosis uses high pressure to

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,039
force water through

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,439
a semi-permeable membrane which results

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,079
in salts on one side of the membrane

21
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,000
and pure water on the other so as we can

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,640
see here normal osmosis would have water

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,399
kind of

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
working its way pure water would go try

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,439
to dissolve the contaminants or salt

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,759
particles here

27
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,599
reverse osmosis as a sane semi-permeable

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,839
membrane but takes applied pressure

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,439
and forces that water going backwards

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,280
the reverse process

31
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,560
and squeezes the water if you want to

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,719
think about it that way through this

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
semi-primal membrane only allowing pure

34
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,400
water to come out

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,159
at this far end however this process can

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,478
be wasteful

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,840
if access to water is limited because

38
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,280
there needs to be kind of a bypass of

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,759
water with the system

40
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,400
there's typically a six to one ratio

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,478
with six parts being fed into the system

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,159
for every one part of pure water that is

43
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,000
produced so while it can

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,600
is great producing pure water it can be

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
a little wasteful in that six to one

46
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,798
ratio so again

47
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,280
keep that in mind if water is a very

48
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,720
limited resource for you

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
why would you want to remove minerals

50
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,118
well arrow water reverse osmosis water

51
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,519
will essentially have no minerals this

52
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,719
allows growers to now control what is

53
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,560
added to the water

54
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,478
if our water is fed directly to plants

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,640
then calcium and magnesium deficiency

56
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,399
is likely so the reason why we have

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,640
water starting with basically nothing

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,239
is that allows whatever part per million

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,879
you're trying to desire

60
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,158
can be all of the elements or nutrients

61
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,239
that you're looking

62
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,159
to add to the water if you already have

63
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,679
high part per million water

64
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
it's going to limit the amount that you

65
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,680
can add to make sure your plants are

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,400
properly fed

67
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,280
reverse as well as this process in very

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,080
quick sense

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
there's typically a three or four stage

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,120
kind of filtration process

71
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
typically that first stage is a sediment

72
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,159
filter simply because we don't want to

73
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
clog any of the

74
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,680
downstream components then the important

75
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,598
carbon filter

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
then we have the impurities are removed

77
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,679
and then we have a post carbon filter

78
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,120
so there are two carbon filters a pre

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
and a post and there can be multiple

80
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,200
stages of

81
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,359
these filtrations the whole goal here

82
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,238
again is to produce that pure water

83
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,959
as close to that pure water as possible

84
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,840
but remind

85
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,199
reminder that there is that six to one

86
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
ratio of lost water

87
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,799
so you need to have a way to kind of

88
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,280
drain out that waste water

89
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
it's not harmful water it's just through

90
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,120
the reverse osmosis process it's need to

91
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
kind of flush the system continually

92
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
to ensure you're producing that as close

93
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,800
to possible

94
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,679
zero ec or zero part per million and

95
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,680
result water
