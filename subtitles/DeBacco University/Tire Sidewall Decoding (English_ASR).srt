1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,240
so if you've ever looked at the sidewall

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,719
of a tire you may have seen a

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,000
whole bunch of letters and numbers and

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,519
thought they were just random

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,439
however they're not here we're going to

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,320
go over entire sidewall decoding and

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,558
we're going to develop

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,879
an understanding for what those numbers

9
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,039
and letters actually mean

10
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,038
so first off here's a quick breakdown of

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,160
just kind of an example of a sidewall

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,320
it can tell you department of

13
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,039
transportation can manufacture and plant

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
code

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,080
the tire size manufacturer identity

16
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,559
number

17
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,479
week in year the tire was made all good

18
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,719
valuable information

19
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,919
so first off that decoding process what

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,719
does it actually look like was it

21
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
involved

22
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,359
well the department transportation

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
number known as the d.o.t number

24
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,479
consists of

25
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,558
and this is just an example the dot

26
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,799
impression the plant code manufacturer

27
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,718
date of manufacture and keep in mind

28
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,839
that tires made after january 1st in the

29
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,079
year 2000

30
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,320
have four numbers in the last group

31
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,480
while prior to that there are only

32
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
three numbers so that can again help

33
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,839
determine just on a large

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,920
scale where that tire may have been

35
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
originally made they all follow this

36
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
same general pattern i'm going to go

37
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
through and break this down a little bit

38
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,640
further

39
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,118
so retrade tires do dot number decoding

40
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,239
is slightly different than a just

41
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,040
regular tire

42
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,719
so keep in mind that the retread tires

43
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
are slightly different numbers

44
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,719
they have something called dotr

45
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,118
department of transportation retread

46
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,158
or r indicates that it's a retread tire

47
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,159
so be careful

48
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,719
of that if you see that r it's going to

49
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,880
be indicating that this is a retread

50
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,798
ypy is manufacturer retread goodyear v

51
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,798
tread

52
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
in canada this was where this was

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,240
manufactured so again

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,159
it can tell you with that code or at

55
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,158
least identifying that code

56
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
it can then go to a conversion to tell

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,200
you exactly

58
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
where that was particularly made and we

59
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
have the date and year of manufacture

60
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,640
so if we're looking at something that is

61
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
a one two zero

62
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,840
one that would indicate it was made in

63
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,039
the twelfth

64
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,680
week of the year two thousand and

65
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
one so an example here of zero eight

66
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,159
zero

67
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,958
two this tire was manufactured from the

68
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,959
eighth week of the year

69
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,959
2002.

70
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,280
so come entire designations that we see

71
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,559
here again the same kind of

72
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
indication occurs we have this example

73
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,800
here

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,560
p stands for passenger tire this 185 or

75
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
in this example here 195 is the

76
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,439
approximate width of the tire

77
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,919
measured in millimeters 65 is the aspect

78
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,719
ratio

79
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,199
rs stands for a radial tire and 15 is

80
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,519
the

81
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,878
rim diameter in inches so you get a

82
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,640
little confusing that measures one thing

83
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,239
in millimeters nothing in inches

84
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,919
but these are just what these numbers

85
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,439
correlate with

86
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,719
so if we take this tire and kind of

87
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,919
break it down into a little bit more

88
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,759
specifics

89
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,280
we'll take a look and see and decode

90
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,280
this sidewall here

91
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
so first off we see the p well p stands

92
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,159
for passenger tire

93
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,799
so these tires are often called p

94
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,719
metrics note that the lt stands for

95
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
light truck st would stand for special

96
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,840
on trailer

97
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,158
and t would stand for temporary so in

98
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,759
the case we see a p this is a passenger

99
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,199
tire the absence of a letter at the

100
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,639
beginning of the size description

101
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,560
indicates that it's a euro

102
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,479
metric tire the 225 so we see here the

103
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,479
225 represents the approximate

104
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,560
section width or with the tire from

105
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,359
sidewall to sidewall again measured in

106
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,759
millimeters

107
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
the larger the number simply put the

108
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,120
wider the tire

109
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,878
is the 60 60 refers to the aspect ratio

110
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
which is the nominal sidewall height

111
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,798
reflected as a percentage

112
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,560
section width so the sidewall height

113
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,799
this tire is 60

114
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,799
of 225 or approximately 135 millimeters

115
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,480
um r here r stands for radial

116
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,840
construction which is the industry

117
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,199
standard for passenger

118
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,120
cars and light truck tires a b or x

119
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,479
and placement of r would indicate the

120
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,400
tire has

121
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,399
a bias or ply construction

122
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,080
the 16 is the rim or bead

123
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,438
diameter 16 represents in inches keep in

124
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,200
mind the diameter

125
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,840
of the beads which means that this tire

126
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,039
is designed to fit on a rim with a 16

127
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,920
inch diameter the 97v is a service

128
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,359
description

129
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,359
and this final component the size

130
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,480
designates called a service description

131
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,120
indicates the

132
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,759
load index and the speed symbol of the

133
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,720
tire

134
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,479
so load index of 97 in this example is a

135
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,320
two or three digit code that represents

136
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,639
the maximum load the tire can be carried

137
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,759
at speed indicated by the speed symbol

138
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,680
so this again getting into a little bit

139
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,960
more of the specifics and this is why

140
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
when you're choosing a tire for your

141
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,000
vehicle

142
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,359
uh depending what tire it is there's a

143
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,759
lot of

144
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,160
options uh provided they're not just all

145
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,319
tires so 16 inch tires anything will do

146
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,840
there's a lot of specialty descriptions

147
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,879
to keep in mind to maximize the

148
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,319
performance

149
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,079
and match the performance of your

150
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,680
particular vehicle

151
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,120
and lastly here's the full sidewall

152
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
information so this kind of gives you

153
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,360
just that general

154
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,439
summary there everything that i've

155
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,120
described here how it looks on a tire so

156
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,839
i invite you to go out

157
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,120
look at the sidewall of any tire if you

158
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,879
and if you have one in the parking lot

159
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
you go to a parking lot just take a look

160
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,120
and hopefully you can with this video

161
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,000
describe a little bit or develop an

162
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,918
understanding

163
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,079
of what those numbers and letters

164
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,439
actually tell you about the specifics

165
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,439
for the tire you're looking at
