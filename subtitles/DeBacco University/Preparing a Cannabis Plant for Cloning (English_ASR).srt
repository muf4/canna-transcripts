1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
all right so now you've selected that

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,120
plant for cloning

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,278
and now you've come to tobacco

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,679
university to learn how to prepare that

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,800
cannabis plant for the cloning process

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:17,850
and that's what we're going to provide

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:20,560
here on this video lecture

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,920
[Music]

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,759
all right let's get into how to prepare

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,920
a cannabis plant for cloning here at

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,400
tobacco university

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,920
first off the chosen one so once a plant

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,598
is chosen the grower should make some

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
adjustments to help ensure

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,200
maximum clone yield from that particular

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,039
plant

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,359
and keep in mind we're looking at having

18
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:42,238
a lot of those shoot tips a lot of those

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,200
vegetative propagation points to allow

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:44,799
multiple

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,480
clones to be generated from that

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,640
original plant

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,159
so younger plants typically are easier

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,520
to clone so if you have a choice between

25
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,799
a younger and older plant

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,719
typically the younger plant would be

27
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,238
preferred however oftentimes it's not

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,679
until the harvest time that

29
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,119
plant's full potential is actually

30
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,759
realized and that's when the grower

31
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,038
determines

32
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,439
they want to go through and clone that

33
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,040
plant once it's identified the chosen

34
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,920
plant should be placed in a vegetative

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,479
light cycle

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,439
of about 18 to 20 hours of a continuous

37
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,359
light

38
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,279
if the plant was in active flowering

39
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,679
stage this will delay the transition

40
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,599
back

41
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,799
to the vegetative stage so again for

42
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,319
timing purposes

43
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,320
as growers just keep that in mind

44
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,758
now when we're up potting the plant here

45
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,199
so again we have our chosen plant we're

46
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,000
going to go through this kind of general

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,880
up potting

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,359
process well since a plant for cloning

49
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,280
will be

50
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,959
a mother or stock plant many growers

51
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,840
elect to put the plant into larger

52
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,599
containers

53
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,359
to reduce the overall stress and allow

54
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,118
the plant to get larger

55
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,560
so again this could be at any stage

56
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,478
typically we'll have a

57
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,000
soilless medias we see here put the

58
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,438
original container in there so we know

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,319
it's going to be a good fit

60
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,118
to allow good soil or media contact with

61
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,199
the roots

62
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,359
to ensure that there's no air pockets

63
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,680
there to cause drying want to have that

64
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,759
root transition to the larger pot very

65
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
easily this is a good little technique

66
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
to go through when you're up potting

67
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
that original plant

68
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,359
now the pruning method that you're

69
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
choosing to use may have to change

70
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,599
compared to the original once you

71
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,199
determine that plant that you're going

72
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,959
to go through this process with

73
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,878
the goal for a plant to be cloned is to

74
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,319
produce many branches as possible

75
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,639
so often this may lead to different

76
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,839
methods of pruning might be implemented

77
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,839
because now your goal is to create as

78
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,080
many little branch points as possible

79
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,159
and not necessarily grow a plant to

80
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,440
produce the maximum number of buds

81
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,039
we want to have definitely a lot of

82
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,359
branches want to be selective with our

83
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,799
pruning method selective with our

84
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,959
method that we go through to help

85
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,920
maximize the number of clones

86
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,199
we can get off a single plant the

87
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,878
fertilizers to use

88
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,958
so while you want to keep the plant

89
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,560
healthy do not over feed it as this will

90
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,560
make the cloning or rooting process

91
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,479
much more of a challenge this is

92
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,280
particularly important in the case of

93
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,199
nitrogen

94
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
so whatever night or whatever nutrients

95
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,560
you might be adding look at the

96
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,719
kind of levels it's good always yes to

97
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,199
fertilize but be mindful in particular

98
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,318
of nitrogen if you over nitrogen feed a

99
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,839
plant it'll grow

100
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,560
very quickly but it'll become kind of

101
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,598
spacey internet spacing wise

102
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,479
and it will be much harder to root

103
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,359
so keep that in mind also you want to be

104
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,679
scouting for

105
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,280
pests keep the plant healthy is very

106
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,239
important i just have a couple insects

107
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,400
listed here

108
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,158
this also pertains to disease this also

109
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,120
pertains to light stress nutrient stress

110
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:21,439
water stress

111
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,959
all things to take into consideration

112
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,439
and to make sure that you're having

113
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,239
those

114
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,318
at a very stable levels so you're not

115
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,759
stressing the plant out

116
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,598
also you want to shift the plant to an

117
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,000
isolated location the goal is to keep

118
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:33,679
the plant

119
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,680
in isolated area to limit the chance of

120
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,560
contamination with other plants that you

121
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,319
may have

122
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
and this is where a grow tent can be a

123
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,958
great environment to help isolate that

124
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
plant

125
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,239
to allow you to do certain things to

126
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,480
that plant to help maximize again the

127
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,400
ability for it to be cloned that might

128
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,439
require a slightly different environment

129
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,280
or conditions

130
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,799
that you're growing your other plants in

131
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,680
so grow tent in this case if you're only

132
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,438
doing one plant

133
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,599
it's a great option otherwise an

134
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,199
isolated room would be an option for

135
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,199
larger scale growers
