1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,299
how the great to be nature versus

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:09,750
nurture how do jeans in the environment

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,570
play and interact with one another is it

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,730
a consistent kind of one versus the

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,368
other it's more of a blended appearance

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,260
how does this actually lurk and how does

7
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:22,140
this actually kind of play out in real

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,179
life well starting here environment

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,219
influences on gene expression

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,210
well phenol copies are environmentally

11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,500
produced phenotypes that mimic mutations

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,079
environmental factors can influence gene

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,460
expression after birth poor nutrition

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,590
can affect brain growth and body

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,739
development in height childhood hormone

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,649
a basically lack of certain hormones can

17
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:46,038
lead to abnormal skeletal growth we see

18
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,289
here obesity trends in the United States

19
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,929
occurring from nineteen eighty five and

20
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,530
we see that there's some differences in

21
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:58,189
different regions of the country

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:01,020
different states tend to have greater

23
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:03,149
obesity we notice that the percentages

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,210
increase overall now we're looking from

25
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:09,420
nineteen eighty five and here we are

26
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:13,019
going 2005 a little bit beyond that and

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,310
seven two thousand eight nine ten

28
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:19,530
so from 1985 to 2010 the important thing

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,200
to keep in mind there is that the

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,239
population or the genetics of the

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,939
population at least it's not changing

32
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,379
all that much and the grand scheme of

33
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:31,739
things that's really not that long a

34
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:34,259
time what's changing though is the

35
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,239
environment that can be changing the

36
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,129
diet of the individuals and that's

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,709
what's occurring here and they're

38
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:43,078
defining as BMI is greater than thirty

39
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:46,408
or thirty pounds overweight for a five

40
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,719
foot floor person so that's just an

41
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,189
example their genes versus the

42
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,289
environment and interactions well

43
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:54,658
environmental limits to make potential

44
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,118
but does not affect the genes the

45
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,729
example here is our bald cypress trees

46
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,228
here's one that's kept in a small little

47
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:03,179
container and grown in a bonsai

48
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:06,149
environment and that tree may only be

49
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,340
mmm you know maybe a foot and a half

50
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,848
tall here would be a bald cypress

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,560
growing in wild where it's able to not

52
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:15,419
hit some sort of

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,090
mental and it's not grown in very small

54
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,759
container you can see how large of a

55
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,860
tree that it can be in this case

56
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,259
these two trees could be clones of one

57
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,120
another they could be the same genetics

58
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:30,649
but based on the environment that they

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,840
are in that conversely impact the total

60
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,550
phenotypic or the expression that we see

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,709
in that we would think to have different

62
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,569
genes but that may not always be the

63
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,860
case

64
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:43,708
she is also environment can learn to

65
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,510
Nick potential limits but does not

66
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,030
affect again the genes in a pea plant

67
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:49,829
growing by the ocean might be small due

68
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,539
to saltwater stress that's occurring

69
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,060
where a pea plant grown in the garden

70
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,229
can reach a much larger size due to lack

71
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,909
of environmental stresses

72
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:58,919
I know trying to say it might be

73
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:00,449
different genes and it's purple flowers

74
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,979
this is white flowers well that may be

75
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:07,399
true in general beach pea grown by the

76
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,719
ocean there seems to be very small and

77
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,730
the garden pieces we have grow very tall

78
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,469
if we were to grow these in the ocean

79
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:16,048
they may not survive at all maybe sell

80
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:17,939
salt intolerant this was evident when

81
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,180
certain researchers were looking for

82
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:23,250
dwarf varieties of things they went to

83
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,109
the beach they found a massive amount of

84
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,340
you know stunted small varieties which

85
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,340
they thought they had the jackpot on

86
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,650
they took samples they cloned them they

87
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,049
brought him back to greenhouses in a

88
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,359
room in other locations away from the

89
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:39,420
ocean and lo and behold the grid of

90
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:41,549
normal size it was the environment I was

91
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,949
limiting the genetics in that case so

92
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,319
it's important to realize that the

93
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:48,209
environment seeming like can limit

94
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,280
genetic potential but really its

95
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,039
environment it's restricting what the

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,780
true genetics can be expressed so we

97
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,159
took a clone to this plant put it in the

98
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,219
proper environment it can get quite

99
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,409
large the genotype would not be any

100
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,000
different but the phenotype would be

101
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,669
different we would see the true

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,799
potential of those genes and relating

103
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,328
this to pumpkins of course I grew a very

104
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,709
small pumpkin in a greenhouse over the

105
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:15,599
winter one year on 2013 those are two

106
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:18,569
20.3 which by giant pumpkin Sanders is

107
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,060
quite small small pumpkins can have

108
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:23,699
great good or bad genes we can't always

109
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,399
be for scherzer small pumpkin large

110
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,089
pumpkins are very likely to have large

111
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,339
pumpkin gene

112
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:31,319
because we can see that Express well

113
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:34,529
what I did here was growing in the

114
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,329
winter in New England here the lack of

115
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:37,859
light and other restriction factors did

116
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:39,810
not allow this pond to get very big

117
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,419
however when seeds from this little

118
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,490
pumpkin were taken out I grew these two

119
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,620
pumpkins over 1,700 pounds for two

120
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,050
different growers these ended up in the

121
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,340
top 15 in the world that year to give

122
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,918
you an idea how big these were back in

123
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:58,739
2013 all from a little 220 pound pumpkin

124
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,539
so this had the genetic potential even

125
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,930
though the environment that was grown in

126
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,040
aisle restricted its size hopefully that

127
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,009
was helpful to give you just a little

128
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,389
comparison of nature and nurture and I

129
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,389
know the debate will continue
