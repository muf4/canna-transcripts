1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,560
okay here we look at photosynthesis

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,059
compared to respiration keep in mind

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,068
photosynthesis occurs in the

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,529
chloroplasts respiration in the

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,230
mitochondria photosynthesis has the

6
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:17,429
light dependent reaction and the Calvin

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,039
cycle respiration is aerobic or could be

8
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:23,509
an aerobic cellular respiration it's

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,340
going to be using glucose and oxygen

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,230
those that are being broken down into

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,859
carbon dioxide and water which are

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,210
needed by the photosynthetic process so

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,640
the general sense here the comparison

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,170
between photosynthesis and respiration

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,750
for synthesis assembles the sugars

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,609
produces stored or potential energy

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,369
respiration breaks down those sugars

18
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:46,649
into energy in releasing that cell

19
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,718
respiration and photosynthesis are

20
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,259
interdependent the glucose and oxygen

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,149
produced by photosynthesis are used in

22
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:56,219
cellular respiration the energy is

23
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,039
transferred to generate ATP with heat

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,910
carbon dioxide and water is released as

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,739
a waste product

26
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,089
the carbon oxide and water are then

27
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:05,819
available as raw materials for

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,740
photosynthesis we see that here here's

29
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,849
our light energy most of this is

30
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:15,478
assembling our the sugar molecule

31
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:17,129
c6h12o6 in taking out oxygen that's then

32
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,679
being used by the process of cellular

33
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:23,548
respiration breaking down that sugar

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,860
molecule to generate ATP heat energy and

35
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,840
also carbon dioxide and oxygen are

36
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,938
byproducts both are needed for the

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,880
photosynthetic process and the cycle

38
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:33,929
then repeats

39
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:36,420
looking specifically at a direct

40
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,329
comparison between the two first since

41
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,728
this only occurs in the light an occurs

42
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:44,368
in cells containing chlorophyll the

43
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:46,618
synthesis produces ATP with light energy

44
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:49,349
and uses carbon dioxide in water

45
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:53,040
molecules this is thought to increase

46
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:56,009
the weight of the organism respiration

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,659
near the end occurs anytime takes place

48
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,759
in living cells but to clear the

49
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,950
mitochondria those living cells and it

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,799
produces ATP with energy released from

51
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,590
the sugar molecules this releases carbon

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,340
dioxide in water and sought to decrease

53
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,090
the weight so we're producing our

54
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,629
photosynthetic process with the light

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,030
energy its producing that glucose

56
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:18,400
that glucose is kind of that stored

57
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,039
energy the stored energy for the process

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,640
of respiration is broken down returning

59
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:27,449
our ATP here that ATP is being used to

60
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,919
do work that work could be movement of

61
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,509
motor proteins could be molecular

62
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,519
transport could be synthesis of

63
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:35,019
biomolecules what's given off as a

64
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,420
byproduct it's carbon dioxide and water

65
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,510
we just need to put a synthetic process

66
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:42,009
to occur and around the cycle goes

67
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:43,810
should be it understand and compare and

68
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:46,239
contrast both photosynthesis and

69
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,409
respiration for some similarities and

70
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,180
how they're needed for biological

71
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:51,180
systems and also some differences
