1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,799
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,720
going to go over direct soil planting of

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,559
cannabis so we're going to describe some

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,718
of the content some of the key things

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,000
advantages and disadvantages to consider

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:17,919
as well as show you

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
this actually happening in practice

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,760
[Music]

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,278
all right let's get into direct soil

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,320
planting of cannabis

11
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,800
so first off seeds can be direct seeded

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,480
but you do want to take some limitations

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,558
with those so while seats can be direct

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,919
seated it's often not done with cannabis

15
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,679
simply because of the elevated

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,039
temperatures that cannabis tends to

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,519
prefer to germinate

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,519
so yes it could be direct stated but may

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,520
not be the best practice

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,039
definitely depending on your location

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,879
seedlings or clones can be

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
is typically what's added to a field of

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:51,198
cannabis and they may be originated from

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,359
seeds

25
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,640
but as far as going right in this soil

26
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,920
and planting seeds

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,679
probably not initially at least advised

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,320
direct soil planting the advantage of

29
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,840
this

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,000
practice is that it's the ease of

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,198
planting and lack of need to supply

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,920
growing substrate

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,519
from outside sources plants can develop

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,879
deeper root systems and plants will

35
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,959
often require

36
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,319
less water we're looking at kind of

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,359
cannabis seeds this would be kind of a

38
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,719
good general

39
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,359
collection here of what would be

40
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,840
considered at least based on visual

41
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,079
inspection mainly higher quality seeds

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,159
you want to see that nice darker brown

43
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,840
some of that kind of like it looks like

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,680
a little veining like appearance there a

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,439
little shattered glass like look

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,799
um that dark coloration do they should

47
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,559
be pretty hard um

48
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,479
in solid there we don't want to see a

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
lot of white seeds or a lot of tan seeds

50
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,519
overall

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,239
simply because that darker brown

52
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,399
indicates that more fully developed seed

53
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,759
now the disadvantages of this kind of

54
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
method is that the soil

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,680
does need to be prepared ahead of time

56
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,520
and if the soil is waterlogged this can

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,439
stunt the growth of plants

58
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,118
weed control can also be an issue with

59
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:56,959
any outdoor operation

60
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,640
however let's take a look at this kind

61
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,839
of process going through

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,920
for direct seeding cannabis plants so

63
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,520
here we're looking at the planting of

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
cannabis clones

65
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,919
in soil and some seedlings here as well

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
and we can see that we're setting up the

67
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,919
field

68
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,680
so again field prep is very important

69
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,119
it needs to be a lot of organization and

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
that starts with getting your equipment

71
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,840
ready ahead of time

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,360
this could be large equipment or it

73
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,000
could be very simple equipment as we see

74
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,319
here simply

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
measuring devices shovels rakes the

76
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,759
basic hand tools

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,840
you can see everyone here getting ready

78
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,159
on the morning going through and rock

79
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,519
picking now the soil was very dry

80
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,359
so when we're going through and roughing

81
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,480
it up to till it initially that's why

82
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,720
you saw the person there

83
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,399
wetting the surface down just to reduce

84
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,519
some of the dust there you can kind of

85
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,599
see them chasing them

86
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,959
with the hose there and as we're going

87
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:45,359
through and kind of tilling that top

88
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,439
layer

89
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
rock picking you see on the left there

90
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,079
that weight string and we also have a

91
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,000
little auger

92
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,519
on a hand drill because it's going to

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,878
initially set the holes

94
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
how do we keep the whole space well

95
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,359
there's just a simple little steak

96
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,319
with a bamboo stake and two people can

97
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,560
easily go through

98
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,318
ensure that there's consistency down

99
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,759
that line in spacing

100
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,759
because that's very important when

101
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,399
you're talking about field applications

102
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,000
overall

103
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,158
it's a very large field you want to make

104
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
sure holes are very consistent

105
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,120
because it gets very easy for them to

106
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,400
get off you can see there we've

107
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,319
completed one row

108
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,400
and we've moved the string there to the

109
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,079
next row now looking at the field we

110
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,920
want to be mindful of the edges of the

111
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,560
field we can see a lot of rocks on the

112
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,559
edge of the

113
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,840
edges of the field and that indicates

114
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,400
kind of what we're running into

115
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,640
here in the main field you can see those

116
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,799
initial first two rows there

117
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,399
working right along and we're putting

118
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,319
the clones and seedlings

119
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,760
right in down the little line there we

120
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,119
can see everyone now working through

121
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,598
that initial area

122
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
uh finding sadly a couple more rocks i

123
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,318
think then

124
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,598
most people would like to find when

125
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,639
you're going through in

126
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,518
seating a particular field there again

127
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,359
working through

128
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,799
everyone's got their little job to do

129
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,959
and trying to make it nice

130
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,319
consistent and efficient of course we

131
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,080
have to bring in some more that manual

132
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,839
labor to kind of bring in and

133
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
pull up some of those rocks but once we

134
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,360
got the holes dug we can see

135
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,679
the little cannabis plant right there

136
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
going right in full nice blue valve root

137
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,159
system right along the strings

138
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,360
and adding in some initial amendments to

139
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:14,878
that planting hole

140
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,720
and they're going through easily and

141
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,798
covering it up making sure everything's

142
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,720
nice and consistent there and of course

143
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,638
knowing how many plants you have

144
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,919
and the spacing of the holes is also

145
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,280
very important

146
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,359
and you will notice that they're hearing

147
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,758
a lot of that kind of ting ting

148
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,360
there is a lot of the rocks here in this

149
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,879
particular area

150
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,879
trying to remove as much of those as

151
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,000
possible uh trying to you know plan

152
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,680
ahead

153
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,040
best if you can but try to keep that

154
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
spacing even

155
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,360
we see the two uh containers there they

156
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,799
look like drinking glasses they kind of

157
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,439
are but they're really meant to

158
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,478
ensure that the amendments added for

159
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,040
planting hole

160
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,240
are nice and consistent it doesn't have

161
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,479
to be a perfect measure

162
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,319
but kind of putting a mark there ensures

163
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,120
that there's some sort of consistency

164
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,279
going on

165
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,038
also allows growers to plan in the sense

166
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,879
that they know exactly how much they're

167
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,000
going to be utilizing they don't overbuy

168
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,560
certain amendments

169
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,918
or they're buying just the right amount

170
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,240
now as we're looking at that

171
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,839
continuation of the process going on

172
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,759
and see a lot of people working through

173
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,879
here again trying to have those

174
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,240
tasks made ahead of time sadly finding

175
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,918
more rocks than we'd

176
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
like to kind of initially thought we

177
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,240
were going to run into

178
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,160
but everyone's got their job to do and

179
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
it's going quite efficiently

180
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,680
which is the best you can do and luckily

181
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,119
this was a relatively cool morning

182
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,120
we can see the amount of rocks on the

183
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
side which is an indication sadly

184
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,280
we're going to run into there's a kind

185
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,199
of one of the cannabis plants there

186
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,638
again they're nice and consistent they

187
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,439
were ready to go in they were delivered

188
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,600
on time

189
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,279
because this is an outdoor operation so

190
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,560
keep in mind we also need to be aware of

191
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,319
our timing

192
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,160
and you can see here we're running into

193
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,560
a couple larger rocks with a couple

194
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,560
larger holes now we've got the plant

195
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,639
number uh precisely measured so we're

196
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,399
not over planting the density

197
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,879
and ensure everything should be

198
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,198
hopefully allocated out very equally

199
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,038
however as i mentioned those rocks and

200
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,280
here the surface got some small pebbles

201
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:07,519
and

202
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,439
rocks that's perfectly fine but going

203
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,079
through sadly running into some

204
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,439
larger rocks and when a little rock

205
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,478
becomes a big rock

206
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,478
well you want to go through and

207
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,839
typically bring in the larger equipment

208
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,680
as you can see here

209
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,198
this is an example of what was thought

210
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,560
to be initially a small rock we're

211
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,639
starting to dig around it

212
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,319
and it simply became larger it kind of

213
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,478
went sideways which is never a good

214
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,080
thing and when that rock doesn't budge

215
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,719
uh that's a sign that might be even

216
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,918
larger this was a field looking at some

217
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,039
of the history that there were some

218
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,198
trees as well

219
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,959
there were some additional roots in this

220
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,520
area we'd see a couple of those

221
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,638
rocks initially excavated out there but

222
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,198
plenty of them

223
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,478
in this particular location there it's

224
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,520
kind of good about that practice it

225
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,680
allows you to go through and see the

226
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,198
full soil profile as well

227
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,800
see what consistencies or

228
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,120
inconsistencies may

229
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
exist and this is why i want to be

230
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
mindful

231
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,680
and try to plan ahead as far as taking a

232
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,360
soil test ahead of time

233
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,720
having all that equipment ready to go

234
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,240
having the plant number

235
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,840
again not all that does everything

236
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
always go to plan with outdoor

237
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,879
operations

238
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,919
because there's a lot of variables not

239
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,279
only in the weather

240
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,959
but just in the conditions where you

241
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,159
might dig a test hold one area and

242
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,598
everything might go fine might find a

243
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,919
couple rocks perfect we'll just dig

244
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,560
those

245
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,478
out well here was one particular spot

246
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,639
that there was a large boulder found

247
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,598
so working through always nice to have

248
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,840
equipment

249
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,639
and to be able to go through and ensure

250
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,719
able to plant

251
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,560
the cannabis clones so hopefully you

252
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,560
enjoyed that and look in the video

253
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,560
