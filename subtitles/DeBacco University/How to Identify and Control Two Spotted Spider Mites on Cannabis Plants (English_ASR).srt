00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,279
in this debaco university video we're

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,519
going to attempt to

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,960
give you some information regarding two

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:16,799
spotted spider mites

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:18,399
on cannabis plants

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
all right let's get into how to identify

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,000
and control two spotted spider mites on

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,159
cannabis plants

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,518
so first off the general description of

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,199
them and this is kind of gives you an

11
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:27,598
idea what they look like when you zoom

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,118
in

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,800
a little bit more of a zoomed out

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:31,839
approach just to show you how small that

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,759
they are

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,000
they are a type of arachnid so the term

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:39,359
spiders rightfully sell

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,480
as they are related to insects they are

19
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,558
very thin at about 1 150th of an inch

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,558
long so they are small

21
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,119
yellow to orange in color with two dark

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,959
spots one on each side of your body

23
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,159
which is evident clearly when you are

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,799
able to zoom in

25
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,078
and a 30x kind of jewelers loop is

26
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,959
recommended so you can be able to zoom

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,719
in on the plants

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
so you can be able to see or identify

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,039
them much easier

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,719
when heavy infestations occur webbing on

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,640
the plants can also be present

32
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,760
which a water mist may help visualize if

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,439
you go through and kind of like take a

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,439
light mist and kind of miss the plants

35
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,559
you might be able to see that fine

36
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,559
droplets of water

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,079
attached to their webs which make it

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,439
easier to identify where they might be

39
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,759
located and where you should be spending

40
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,519
time

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,840
scouting and investigating your plants

42
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,158
so that identification what are we

43
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,560
looking at here well that webbing occurs

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,159
when high numbers become established the

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,240
goal is to first identify them

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,359
when the leaf flecking initially occurs

47
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,798
this is kind of what we're talking about

48
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,159
that kind of like initially looks like

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,640
someone went through and just scraped

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,920
off

51
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,680
tops of the leaves because they are kind

52
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
of that feeding insect that's what we're

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
going to notice

54
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,959
initially positive id may require that

55
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,879
30x loop as i mentioned earlier

56
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,399
that lens if you can get it with an led

57
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,759
all the better because it really allows

58
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,000
you to shine a bright light

59
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,200
to a small area to make identification

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,359
of the plants visually

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,799
much much easier you can also shake the

62
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,920
leaves over a piece of clean cardboard

63
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,520
to help you detect their presence

64
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,840
because they will be knocked off and

65
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,118
land on the cardboard as i mentioned

66
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,880
when they become

67
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,718
well established you get this definitely

68
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,439
kind of marking of the

69
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,959
leaf surface here that leaf reflecting

70
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,239
also have that webbing of course this is

71
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,080
an advanced stage once

72
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,759
when there are much lower numbers this

73
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
web will be much thinner and that water

74
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,199
mist will help

75
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,039
you visualize that so how do you go

76
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,000
about managing two-spotted spider mites

77
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,120
well in general they

78
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,280
are very difficult to manage

79
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,319
so this is want to be mindful of being

80
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,159
very preventative

81
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,039
in limiting their numbers as much as you

82
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,400
can certain species of lady beetles uh

83
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,079
and predatory mites

84
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,439
naturally control two spotters two

85
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,800
spotted spider mites

86
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,039
at least when they're present in low

87
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,560
numbers and that speaks again to the

88
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,479
importance of keeping spider mite

89
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
numbers as low as possible

90
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,840
using long lasting pesticides like by

91
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,200
ethereum or

92
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,039
prethrins kill natural enemies and

93
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,799
should be avoided and encourage

94
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,959
the natural enemies to help regulate the

95
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,239
population if you're using soaps or

96
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
horticultural oils

97
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,080
that shows some effectiveness to ensure

98
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,759
greater efficiency be sure to apply them

99
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,440
to the underside of the leaves

100
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,598
well make sure you're getting a good

101
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,359
coating of that and also getting the top

102
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,560
sides that's usually the easier portion

103
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,159
of the plant to get

104
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,840
and also you may need to make repeated

105
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,158
applications of these products

106
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,560
to get some sort of effective control

107
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,000
but keep scouting for them be mindful of

108
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
any new plant material you bring

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,400
in because you definitely want to avoid

110
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,399
these within your cannabis plants
