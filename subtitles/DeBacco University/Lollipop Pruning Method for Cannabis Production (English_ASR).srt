00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:06,878
going to go over the lollipop

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:17,198
pruning method to maximize the

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:18,719
light exposure to your plant's leaves

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,560
let's get into the lollipop pruning

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,399
method for cannabis production

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,320
so first off what are we doing with the

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,198
ipod method well we're enhancing the top

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,359
buds

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,599
visually the lollipop plants have bare

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,359
stems with no foliage towards the bottom

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,880
similar to a lollipop stick we can see

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,120
that evident right here

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,040
lollipopping is a pruning technique that

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,959
enhances the buds at the top

16
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,719
this works well with growers also

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,359
planning on the screen of green pruning

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,359
method

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,280
helps really train those branches and

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,238
eliminate any lower leaves to help air

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
circulation

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,320
and also just plant efficiency the

23
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,439
result is to maximize

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,759
the bud size of those apical buds

25
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,718
this can be done also with autoflowers

26
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,358
as well so

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,399
not just sativa or indica dominant

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,000
strains can also be done with

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,679
autoflowers

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,920
now what's happening is as i said we're

31
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:07,920
trying to maximize that kind of

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
light use live popping allows for the

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,640
greatest light intensity to be utilized

34
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,359
by the plant

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,879
is accomplished by removing growth up to

36
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,159
a certain point now that certain point

37
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,560
is determined by the grower

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,840
here we can see all these leaves kind of

39
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
clean removed

40
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,359
maximizing the light exposure of the

41
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,478
leaves up here

42
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,438
we also see that evident in the plants

43
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,438
here

44
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,279
all the lower leaves kind of cleared out

45
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,959
here they though they went a couple

46
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,960
fewer nodes up the plant before they

47
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,919
started not removing leaves here they

48
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,000
went a little higher

49
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,280
again that's grower choice this pruning

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,959
method though will focus the light

51
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
energy being efficiently captured and

52
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,478
stored by the apical buds

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,640
and simply the goal is to maximize the

54
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,239
bud size and also the quality of the

55
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,759
buds produced

56
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,599
now how do you go about doing this

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,200
method well the lipoprinting method

58
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,719
should be initiated

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,320
initially kind of completed two to three

60
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,679
days before the plants are flipped into

61
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,039
a flowering photo period

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,799
or it can even be done a little bit

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,719
before that because you want to start by

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,799
removing unnecessary lower

65
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,478
foliage that is heavily shaded simply

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,680
it's not getting enough light

67
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:08,878
how to determine if it's not getting

68
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,599
enough light will you check with a

69
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,359
parameter

70
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,199
this ensures growers can know the light

71
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,239
intensity that actually is within the

72
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,238
canopy

73
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,480
typically the entire branches are not

74
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,080
removed unless there are some

75
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,598
they are short and not reaching the main

76
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,599
light intensity to begin with

77
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,199
so typically the branches are kept it's

78
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,199
the leaves that are removed

79
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,238
in general growers should focus their

80
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,159
timing

81
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,039
their trimming efforts and their timing

82
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,959
and for five or more nodes below the top

83
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,479
or apricon meristem of the plant we

84
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,080
don't want to prune them way up to just

85
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,840
a very tippity top

86
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
and we do want to allow some portion of

87
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
canopy there

88
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,238
again trimming there about five or more

89
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,439
notes below the top

90
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,800
is a good starting point for you now

91
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,919
lollipopping is not

92
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,599
the same as defoliation so yes both do

93
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,119
involving moving leaves so that is true

94
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,199
but lollipopping focuses

95
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
on the bottom part of the plant with a

96
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,878
focus on removing growth that receives

97
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,480
minimal light

98
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,239
specifically light popping favors the

99
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,919
apical or top buds

100
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
while defoliation really does not

101
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,399
prioritize defilations just removing

102
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:09,919
leaves

103
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
not really in an organized format per

104
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,359
say lollipopping is really focusing on

105
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,158
those that are not getting the light

106
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,840
intensity

107
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:17,280
taking those out it's a very directed

108
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,878
form

109
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,640
now common method here is lollipopping

110
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,079
is completely done as part of a complete

111
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,759
pruning or training program

112
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,760
for example lollipopping and the screen

113
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,199
of green tend to go hand in hand

114
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,120
why because you're trying to maximize

115
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,119
all those branches out on the screen

116
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,319
as a result that lower portion is not

117
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
getting very much light

118
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,598
and you want to improve your air

119
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,080
circulation so you're maximizing your

120
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:39,679
light

121
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,319
here you're also increasing your air

122
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,200
circulation this is why lollipopping and

123
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,280
screen of ring

124
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:49,280
typically are done together even though

125
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,280
each can kind of be done independently
