1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,120
in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:07,919
going to go over

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,919
the terpene karyophiline in more detail

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,079
[Music]

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,919
all right let's get into the terpene

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,358
guide to karyo filing and what we see in

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,279
the image here is some black pepper

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,679
because that's kind of what represents

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,960
this particular terpene so when we're

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,160
looking at the scent location and

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,039
general properties

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,439
of this particular terpene it has a

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,800
spicy peppery woody kind of scent to it

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,039
that's why we had the black

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,558
pepper image at the beginning foods that

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,679
it contains obviously black pepper

17
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,320
rosemary oregano

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,039
cloves and other dark leafy green herbal

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,960
plants

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,200
you'll find caryophylline in lavender

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,878
black pepper and cinnamon leaves as well

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,879
carophylline will selectively bind to

23
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,640
cb2 receptors which are actually found

24
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,238
outside of the brain and other parts of

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
the body resulting in possible

26
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,919
classification as a cannabinoid so kind

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,238
of an interesting

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,359
tidbit there as far as how this might be

29
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,519
classified in the future

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,800
but currently it is classified as a

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,320
terpene

32
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,319
because it's not a psychoactive

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,759
component of cannabis so that's probably

34
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,319
what's causing it to fall into the

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,240
terpene category now the medical

36
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,478
benefits of this particular

37
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,280
terpene is that it does bind to also cb3

38
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,438
receptors

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,439
it can be highly useful for inflammatory

40
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,359
disorders such as arthritis multiple

41
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,519
sclerosis and chronic pain

42
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,719
care filing can also be beneficial for

43
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,879
treating anxiety

44
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,000
and depression without the overwhelming

45
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,478
mental effects

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
found from thc now if you're looking for

47
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:32,319
what strains that might have a little

48
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,720
bit higher

49
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,919
of this particular terpene here is some

50
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,400
general information

51
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,519
uh provided along with kind of the

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
structure

53
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,679
and some other general information but

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
again these are just some to initially

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
start looking at as far as strains go

56
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,759
i'm sure there's many others

57
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
also kind of a little summary slide here

58
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,359
and if you liked

59
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
this video we have other ones on other

60
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:59,039
various other

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,040
terpenes here on debaco university
