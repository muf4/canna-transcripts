1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
okay Hugh metallian a little bit of one

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,870
of the larger groups of dinosaurs and

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,880
the evolution of dinosaurs and how that

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,620
kind of relates and provide a local

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,019
connection for those that live in

6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:15,689
southern New England so evolution of

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,118
dinosaurs see we differ our different

8
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:20,820
time periods and our progression and

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:23,009
branch points of different types of

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,740
dinosaurs suddenly we see him around

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,570
here on 65 million years ago it's kind

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,969
of like a distinctive stop they all kind

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,759
of reach an end point and modern day is

14
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:35,089
up here and you can see the branch point

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,829
that made it to the end and how many

16
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,290
different types of species and subsets

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,500
were ended around that 65 million years

18
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,939
ago so evolution of - oh here's a

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,250
Triassic period it's the oldest known

20
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:49,439
fossils we have small carnivorous

21
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,000
dinosaurs dominate this time period now

22
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,198
when I say small I'm talking about three

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,469
hundred thirty to four and forty

24
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,570
estimated pounds here they're successful

25
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,670
these were successful because their legs

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,530
were directly under their body provides

27
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,899
good support being where agile and

28
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,599
beings fast runners we're well adapted

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,420
to dry conditions and mass extinction of

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,069
other infants reduced competition so

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,200
we're looking at what makes an organism

32
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,508
survive well this organism to its

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,150
environment very well when we're talking

34
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,700
about the Triassic period in particular

35
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,250
talking about that 208 plus million

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,829
years ago then it goes Jurassic and

37
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,069
Cretaceous the period does all part of

38
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:31,650
the Mesozoic era and then we get closer

39
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,938
into modern-day dinosaurs became extinct

40
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,579
at the end of the Cretaceous period

41
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:38,728
again around that plus or minus 65

42
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,048
million years ago now Pangaea and the

43
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:41,929
dinosaurs remember the world looked very

44
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:46,170
different around 200 million years ago

45
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:48,750
try our climate the mass extinctions and

46
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,689
have curd diversity to fill mitches left

47
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,078
by these extinct species the Mesozoic

48
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:56,908
eras considered the age of reptiles 235

49
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:57,509
million years ago dinosaurs dominated

50
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,420
the earth

51
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,118
pam g has separated climates and changed

52
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,460
dinosaurs became extinct while new

53
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,019
species flourished so we have this kind

54
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,489
of initially this is kind of how it

55
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,590
looked it since all our continents kind

56
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,460
of colored in what Pangaea is that one

57
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,469
single landmass

58
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,629
that eventually all broke apart and keep

59
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:19,719
in mind even today the continents are

60
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:22,150
still moving providing a local

61
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,490
connection on dancer State Park located

62
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,099
in rocky hill Connecticut they

63
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,050
accidentally found 2,000 dinosaur tracks

64
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:32,739
there's uncovered during the excavation

65
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:35,530
for a new building in 1966 literally one

66
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,840
of the operators of the equipment

67
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,539
bulldozer sat down to have lunch and

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,460
looked down saw what he thought was

69
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,019
dinosaur footprints and that led to

70
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,420
other people looking and eventually the

71
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,450
discovery of these 2,000 tractors in a

72
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:51,129
rock layer more than 500 of the tracks

73
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:53,169
are now enclosed within the exhibit

74
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,840
centers geodesic dome which is open to

75
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:57,939
the public and remaining 1500 are still

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,950
buried for preservation and they look

77
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,740
quite good they're very well preserved

78
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:05,109
and this is one of the model dinosaurs

79
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,379
that you could see in the dinosaur State

80
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,870
Park it's important to a sir state park

81
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:13,240
in Rocky Hill on the side note the

82
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,930
footprints are named separately from the

83
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,700
dinosaur

84
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,400
so since conditions that preserve

85
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:19,719
footprints do not preserve bones

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,610
typically like a mudslide as great

87
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,710
preserving bones not right for

88
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,740
footprints the footprint is given its

89
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,930
own unique name compared to the likely

90
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,629
dinosaur that made them so the actual

91
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,670
footprints in Connecticut are called you

92
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,379
bronty's and this is a positive

93
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:38,349
footprints of the dinosaur actually

94
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:41,319
stepped and that's a kind of a downward

95
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:44,439
depression the negative print is a

96
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,509
raised region this is the sediment net

97
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,400
filled in so keep in mind or to get

98
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:51,459
accurate footprints we need the dinosaur

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,469
to step in mud with a thin layer of mica

100
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,480
or some other substance to come in that

101
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:57,400
can separate and we need sediment to

102
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,590
come in typically this is like a rising

103
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,900
and falling tide and that allows these

104
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,189
two sections to separate if you get the

105
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,050
footprint but not that thin layer of

106
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:06,819
mica to be able to separate it the key

107
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,580
walking on the beach more sand fills in

108
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:10,539
and you never knew the two step their

109
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,510
positives where the dinosaur stepped

110
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:14,949
negative is the seven that fills in the

111
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:17,920
dinosaur that we believe made those is

112
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:19,389
called Dilophosaurus nearest bones those

113
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,270
were found were in Arizona

114
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,680
far cry from Connecticut but it matches

115
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:26,199
the same approximate height and weight

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,199
and lived around the same time here

117
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,759
if you seen Jurassic Park they'll

118
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,029
officers look something like this

119
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:37,120
and it's kind of Hollywood taking their

120
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:38,109
own liberties with developing a quote

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,360
they may think is a cool-looking

122
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,730
dinosaur but we keep in mind that

123
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,430
Hollywood and that is nowhere near the

124
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,150
accuracy of what we believed I love this
