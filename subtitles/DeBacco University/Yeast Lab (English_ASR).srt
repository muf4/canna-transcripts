00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,720
welcome to this debaco university video

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,240
where we'll be looking at a population

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,080
lab with yeast if you get different

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,480
sugar solutions to see how that changes

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,480
the yeast population

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,320
[Music]

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,759
okay so today's lab is going to be

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,359
looking at growing yeast here we have uh

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,439
some yeast and we have some different

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,199
sugar solutions so we're going to take a

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,079
look and see what sugar solution the

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,079
yeast prefers as far as what does it

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,238
grow the best in how we're going to do

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,920
that is by measuring or observing the

15
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,919
amount of carbon dioxide that is

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
produced so we need to develop a way to

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,320
capture that so we're going to be using

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,878
fermentation test tubes these are large

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,079
test tubes and regular small test tubes

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,000
i'm going to show you how we're going to

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,920
set these up

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,280
all right this shows the basic

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
lab how it should look in the end with

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,039
our molasses and honey solutions we'll

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,480
also be preparing our refined sugar

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,879
here's our stock solutions of honey

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,679
refined sugar and molasses as well as

28
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:04,000
our yeast suspension ready to go

29
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,438
we're going to take our large beakers

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,599
this is going to hold everything be

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,079
careful this is all a glassware

32
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,559
and i have one of the small test tubes

33
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,400
now measuring the exact amount of liquid

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,400
isn't that important we want to make

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,478
sure is we're going to fill this up so i

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
have molasses

37
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,000
regular refined sucrose or sugar and

38
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,039
then i have honey each of these are 20

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,959
solution

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,159
so i've allocated them out into small

41
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:33,919
beakers here again we take our test tube

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,560
we take our honey solution which is 20

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,759
we add approximately

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,560
halfway

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,399
full of our honey solution

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
we've got our honey solution there then

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,040
we're going to take about 20 drops which

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,280
is going to equal one milliliter of our

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,280
yeast solution

50
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,559
20 perfect

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,960
we've got our yeast solution we can

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,799
clearly see is kind of separated out

53
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,679
from the honey so you want to just kind

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,800
of

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,319
mix that in to get a good even

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,840
distribution

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:16,238
and then we're going to fill the test

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,280
tube back up with that 20 honey solution

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,120
as close to the top as we can get

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,400
take our fermentation test tube that

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,520
we've got that

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,719
full take our fermentation test tube

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,480
add that over the top here carefully

64
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,080
this is always glassware

65
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,919
push that up to the very top as we can

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,879
see there

67
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,719
and then we're just going to kind of

68
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,399
flip this over

69
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,560
and then we're going to measure the air

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,159
bubble that's been produced there and

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,560
over time that yeast is going to grow

72
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,719
the co2 gets captured and we'll be able

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,920
to measure that over a period of time

74
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,598
we're going to repeat that also with the

75
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,679
other sugar solution

76
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,280
and you can see here pretty much around

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,560
the same air bubble and let's see how

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,560
they look

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,560
tomorrow

80
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,639
so now we've given our

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
these some time to grow in their various

82
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,919
trigger solutions and we can see there

83
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,560
is varying degrees of happiness going on

84
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,439
we have the molasses we have the honey

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,000
and we have the refined sugar this is

86
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,799
the clear one and we can see that there

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,719
is a difference between the amount of

88
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,360
carbon dioxide gas produced the amount

89
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,840
of bubbles the greater the bubble height

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,680
the greater the amount of yeast so in

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,360
our example here the molasses definitely

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,360
has the greatest bubble indicating that

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,519
the yeast is growing the best in this

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,560
sugar solution that would then be

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,480
followed by our sucrose or refined sugar

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,439
located right here

97
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:53,280
and lastly it looks like in this example

98
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,840
here the honey had the least amount of

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,158
yeast growth relating directly to the

100
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,000
least amount of carbon dioxide produced

101
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,079
how we're going to quantify this well

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,759
we're simply going to take a ruler and

103
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,319
we're going to measure in millimeters

104
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,000
the height of that bubble so we're going

105
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,878
to go through and we're going to take

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,199
the area from the height of that bubble

107
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,359
to basically the height of that test

108
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,639
tube and measure that in comparison

109
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,840
compare that to our reading we

110
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,120
originally took when we initially

111
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,279
flipped everything over

112
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,720
and got the initial bubble because we

113
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,478
left usually just a little bit of a

114
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,280
bubble there to begin with now we're

115
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,279
able to see how much gas was produced

116
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,679
directly correlating to the amount of

117
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,879
yeast here the population of the yeast

118
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,478
in this sugar solution

119
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,519
and here we can clearly see those

120
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,839
differences this is again the molasses

121
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,000
producing the

122
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:47,918
most in comparison

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,560
the honey here has the least amount

124
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,959
and the refined sugar is clear liquid

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,199
solution is a little hard harder to see

126
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,399
but that had the second most

127
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,919
so again we're looking here we're

128
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:02,758
directly recording carbon dioxide

129
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,758
production to yeast population
