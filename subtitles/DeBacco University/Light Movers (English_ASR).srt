1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,649
something that I know is popular with

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,870
many growers is the addition of light

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,580
movers well may not look exactly like

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,769
this the concept is the same where they

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,830
have lights on the rail they're moving

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,330
that across the plants there so some of

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,160
the basics are can can't be like this

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,469
gantry system where we have the light

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,939
there is out a rail the light mounts it

10
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,518
allows it to easily move throughout the

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,710
day the whole purpose so this is the

12
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,198
minute kind of the travelling of the Sun

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,670
for the plants to increase the amount of

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,368
angles that those plants are getting

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,870
light exposed to so the benefits it

16
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:35,488
reduces the chance of a hot spot or

17
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,849
burning the plants because that light is

18
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:41,308
moving it allows plants to cool down and

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,530
the lights can be placed closer to the

20
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,539
plants this can increase the penetration

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,120
in angle of the light and again it's in

22
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,969
kind of mimics the Sun here it kind of

23
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,820
gives that light some exposure from

24
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:54,689
different sides so all well and good

25
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,929
however we have to consider the

26
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:59,729
drawbacks here and it depends on a motor

27
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,399
which can you fail so that's one very

28
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:05,069
important aspect is that electric motor

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,960
moving that light will that can fail it

30
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,309
does not necessary see air you can grow

31
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,839
in some growers think that you can

32
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,900
reduce the amount of lights in the same

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,310
area and this is not the case so people

34
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,200
think oh I just take one light and I

35
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,759
move it across this area where I would

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,219
normally put a bunch of other lights I

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,750
don't have to use those and sadly that's

38
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,368
not the case because there's no

39
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,040
replacement for the area coverage by a

40
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:28,259
single light your average thousand watt

41
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,079
high pressure sodium is covered about a

42
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,170
5x5 area whether you move it or not it's

43
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,118
only covering that 5x5 area only the

44
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,368
angle of the light is being changed and

45
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,228
not to say the intensity over a grow on

46
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:42,450
space so again important to

47
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:44,728
consideration I personally not a fan of

48
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,930
light movers I feel you just have the

49
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:47,578
lights and you can add different

50
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,560
spectrums of lights that's all well and

51
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:52,109
good moving the light to me there's just

52
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,618
too much potential that could go wrong

53
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:58,709
and I see very little gain and that's

54
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:01,849
why I choose not to use them from my

55
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,849
grow operations
