1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,710
okay so here I'm going to talk about the

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,778
cannabis cup this is often mentioned

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,509
quite a bit and you might see seeds or

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,830
cultivars labels cannabis cup winner so

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,500
I should describe a little bit about

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,000
what this is all about well within the

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,138
cannabis cup there might be many out

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,850
there but kind of the High Times

9
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:21,239
Cannabis Cup is someone it's kind of

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,880
regarded as the most widely accepted it

11
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,288
has categories rules regulations and

12
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,899
everything I present here space in the

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,550
2017 competition there may be some

14
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,348
changes so use this as a point in time

15
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,539
reference guide always check the current

16
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,340
year's competition rules Edition only

17
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,259
some reason provided so consult the full

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,940
list of rules directly linked to the

19
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,460
rules for that used in the presentation

20
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:44,218
are right here if you want to go through

21
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,049
and find them this is a direct link to

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,780
them so again if any competition should

23
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:50,759
know the rules this is from 2017

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,379
so why the High Times Cannabis couple

25
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,909
it's large and well-established event

26
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,099
that has set some of the standards for

27
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,479
judging and competition that's why I

28
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,239
chose to focus on this one in particular

29
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,558
as with any competition our rules

30
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,390
established but there are also some

31
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,609
potential concerns I've attempted to

32
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,200
provide some opinions and potential

33
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,599
shortcomings of the rules that are

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,189
presented now the official rules

35
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:12,929
important notes all judging for High

36
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:14,908
Times Cannabis Cup is conducted by

37
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,130
doctor prescribed in state licensed

38
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,930
medical marijuana patients entries are

39
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:20,579
collected and distributed under the

40
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,380
legal frameworks of each state's legal

41
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,719
medical or recreational cannabis program

42
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,298
or guidelines so that's their official

43
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,969
kind of stated rules now a general

44
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,310
statement they do hold the human element

45
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,170
as a judging system is a variable

46
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,240
component in the process even so they're

47
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,409
measurable science component so they

48
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,298
typically have a qualitative and

49
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,159
quantitative depending on what category

50
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,618
and they want to have that experiences

51
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,960
like the driver experience with also

52
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,420
that kind of lab based kind of results

53
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,548
so the qualitative side of scoring sheet

54
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,200
accounts for about seventy percent while

55
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,240
the quantitative side accounts for about

56
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,609
thirty percent and against through

57
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,989
Sanders may vary by category but that

58
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:59,759
thirty percentage that quantitative is

59
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,170
more that scientific lab results

60
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,868
qualitative is more that human

61
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,009
experience so general categories are

62
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:07,200
listed here I'm going to go through them

63
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,848
for each category a summary of the

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,610
category and description we presented

65
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,049
followed by my comments the same format

66
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,650
will be used for judging and scoring

67
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,420
information

68
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,920
sections so here we're looking at the

69
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,208
flower category so I'm not going to bore

70
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,378
and go through all the rules you can

71
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,479
pause if you don't read those for

72
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:23,068
yourself but in this flower category we

73
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,699
limit to the sativa indicated flower

74
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:27,988
entries well right there the this is the

75
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,568
part where the use of sativa and

76
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,938
indicating indica categories continues

77
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:34,949
to exist you use as criteria to be

78
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:37,500
defined even though there are only

79
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:39,089
morphological differences not actual

80
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,759
chemical differences so this kind of is

81
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,640
part of just continuing that kind of

82
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,378
debate in that separation are that

83
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,238
thought of separation between indica and

84
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:50,818
sativa is when there's no scientific

85
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,400
basis for that the judging and scoring

86
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,530
for flowers the use of lab tests focuses

87
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,359
on the actual content of THC or CBD

88
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,039
however tripping levels can impact the

89
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:01,170
taste and profile kinda like a fine wine

90
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,938
also since this is the actual plant

91
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:05,068
product how it physically looks as taken

92
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:06,388
into consideration so it's again it's

93
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,869
that lab component that human experience

94
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:11,069
and also that visual effects

95
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,658
concentrates in non solvent hash there's

96
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:14,310
a category this again shows the

97
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,878
difficulty to change that you may need

98
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,829
to use the term cultivar they're using a

99
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:23,608
lot of like you know you can see the

100
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,919
terms of you know strains and you know

101
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,019
varieties and not necessarily cultivars

102
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,750
and get away from these category

103
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,120
classifications that may be established

104
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,739
but lack scientific support so just

105
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,650
because it's constantly settle indicas

106
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,319
and sativas this is again not showing a

107
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,639
strong scientific basis for that even

108
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,548
though it's commonly established in the

109
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,939
industry to the current point in time at

110
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:49,469
least now the judging the use of lab

111
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,930
tests focuses on again the actual

112
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,239
teaching in CBD have again those terpene

113
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,010
profiles can affect the taste this is

114
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,500
similar to the flower category but since

115
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:00,478
hash has been processed it has a certain

116
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,780
expected visual appearance for that

117
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,970
consistency now edibles is a category

118
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,709
has to be a very broad category takes

119
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:09,299
into account the actual product but also

120
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,519
the packaging is part of the scoring

121
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,739
criteria criteria which makes blind

122
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,389
judging that possible when producing the

123
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,280
product the packaging is also very

124
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,470
important in this category addresses the

125
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,158
need for quality product and also

126
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,139
quality advertising the judging as it

127
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:27,209
shows a very diverse marketplace here

128
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,129
and lack of consistency one

129
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:32,159
flaws at product labels in packaging are

130
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:34,649
simply graded on this criteria category

131
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,039
as being present and are not actually

132
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:40,109
checked or verified that what stated on

133
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:42,149
the package matches the test result so

134
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,710
that's a major issue because this can be

135
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:49,589
misleading and the miss this concept to

136
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:51,089
the consumer that what is on the label

137
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,339
actually represents what's in the

138
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:54,659
product so this misconception is kind of

139
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:57,329
like oh it's on the label it's got to be

140
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,539
in the product not necessarily verified

141
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:01,889
at least in this case for the edibles

142
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:03,449
CBD entries so this demonstrates that

143
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,960
there's more than just percentage of CBD

144
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:10,439
at play when selecting a cultivar also

145
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,659
getting into the look of you know not

146
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,699
relying solely on those lab results in

147
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,590
the past that they have they've

148
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,810
demonstrated it's just more than CBD at

149
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:21,209
play there's more to that however this

150
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,680
does add a variable to the category and

151
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:24,779
that can you know cause a different

152
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,418
rating system I mean hard to find but

153
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:29,279
the exact definition is for that within

154
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:30,779
the judging adding the human and lab

155
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,519
result speaks to the importance of the

156
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:34,859
experience or that kind of relates in

157
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,288
the terpene level as much as the quality

158
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,509
of CBD that is produced in that final

159
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:41,728
product

160
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:43,710
there's the vape pen category so this is

161
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:46,468
part of a larger challenges the ease of

162
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:48,689
use of such devices in flavoring

163
00:05:46,468 --> 00:05:51,598
additives indicating the focus on

164
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:53,158
recreation unless on medical value so

165
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:56,519
again while this can be a great way for

166
00:05:53,158 --> 00:06:00,538
very easy way there must be a way that's

167
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:02,310
too easy I was newly established in 2016

168
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:04,050
the kidding its popularity but the

169
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,968
flavoring additives kind of get that

170
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,668
focused more on that recreation unless

171
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:10,529
in the medical value also we look at the

172
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:13,439
judging the scoring an issue is that

173
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:16,649
extra points are awarded to a vape pen

174
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,939
that's more stealthier further dividing

175
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:20,158
the manufacturing to produce something

176
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,718
that can be hidden even if there's you

177
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:24,649
know exponential uses of these style

178
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:28,050
products by underage individuals so this

179
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:30,508
kind of favoring that concealing is only

180
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,699
driving that potential use by underage

181
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,740
users so that can be an issue that the

182
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,560
rewarding companies for making a better

183
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,210
concealed product also it's nice to see

184
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,949
that adding ingredients directions and

185
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:43,319
warning labels get bonus points

186
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,569
not a requirement so again it's kind of

187
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,759
speaks to and I lastly the shadiness of

188
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,589
this particular category and part of

189
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,769
reason why in such a bad rap is because

190
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:54,000
of these particular reasons here

191
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:55,740
topicals are becoming an increasing

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,110
popular which justifies their recent

193
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01,079
inclusion for pain relief in particular

194
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,600
the judging of this category and if use

195
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,129
topical is required to participate but

196
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,820
keep in mind at the level or

197
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:10,949
concentration is not a classification so

198
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,870
as a user you need to keep the total

199
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,329
amount product contains as a

200
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,490
consideration it's not a requirement at

201
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:19,859
all topicals must contain X amount of

202
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,079
percent so again just important to keep

203
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,910
that in mind with the various

204
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,699
cannabinoid infused products that are

205
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:30,240
out there the judging process high x is

206
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,430
a scoring system so they kind of a

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,470
scorecard that gets placed employees

208
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,480
two-tier digital and online and score

209
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,630
sheet and of these score book includes

210
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,730
qualitative and quantitative scores each

211
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:44,100
entry score averages will then be added

212
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,230
to correlated with the lab results by

213
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,420
the uploaded data this system that

214
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,370
combines the judges averages qualitative

215
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,590
score with the quantitative lab score

216
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,310
get in the final total of possible 100

217
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:58,259
points chemist clef closing judging

218
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,540
statement at high times strives to

219
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,759
create most accurate and comprehensive

220
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,200
scoring system in the canvas industry

221
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,629
your participation in feedback as a

222
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,829
competitor is integral to the process we

223
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,969
hope you're proud to be a part of the

224
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,569
process and we thank you for your

225
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,370
support

226
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,019
patience as we continually evolve the

227
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,060
system into the world's ultimate canvas

228
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:16,529
scoring index so they do give

229
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,959
indications that they are willing to

230
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:21,719
change again this is just looking at

231
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,839
2017 as a point in time definitely areas

232
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,610
I think for improvement and as we get

233
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,949
more people on board here that we can

234
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,910
start to see some of the flaws and

235
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,560
high-time seems that they're striving

236
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,960
for that accuracy so it is that

237
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,669
potential for change

238
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,290
lastly cannabis cup winners are they in

239
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,219
the industry this is a high honor and

240
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,889
it's something that is a mark of

241
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,259
excellence cultivars are often regarded

242
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,990
as blank ears canvas cup winner you know

243
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,759
the 2010 cannabis cup winner of the 2016

244
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,620
canvas Cup winner you'll see that a lot

245
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,909
of the times so departing to go back to

246
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,470
the rules and see what that actually

247
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:53,879
means what they actually have to do to

248
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,290
qualify for that

249
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,600
it's more to understand some degree

250
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:59,610
which the grading system and to this

251
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,680
label so you have a meaning or what mean

252
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,720
making a comparison between two

253
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,059
varieties just because sometimes at

254
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,920
canvas a couple winner should be

255
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:10,198
regarded as a blanket statement look

256
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,318
back and see what some of the

257
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:14,879
requirements are for that and again the

258
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:17,399
yurt may have one if you can find those

259
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,578
rules for that particular year all the

260
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,578
better
