1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
now while this image shows the curing

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,048
process for wine wine bottles the same

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,960
can be applied to cannabis on how the

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,019
importance of this curing process is for

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,900
the final determination of the end

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,910
product so blood should be placed in

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,100
seeable airtight container canning jars

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,050
are commonly used but watch out for a

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,060
light and when I have a curing process

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,609
to be a very dark and heavily shaded

11
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:28,768
process the full curing process may take

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,920
up to about two weeks and this is the

13
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:34,679
final step in the curing of cannabis so

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,450
be mindful of the containers and things

15
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,700
that you're using this is kind of like

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,879
the last step here as I said carrying

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,260
jars are very commonly used I'll carry

18
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:44,339
in containers typically have a light

19
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,619
block so you don't wanna do something

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,520
that's clear if you're gonna be storing

21
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,709
it where there is gonna be some light

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,859
exposure they do make some light block

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,730
containers as we see here in this file

24
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:56,850
otherwise you keep them in the dark

25
00:00:53,729 --> 00:01:00,179
location and you'll be fine now the key

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,800
component is that it's airtight and many

27
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:05,010
growers are adding to a community

28
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:10,170
control packs typically the goal is 62%

29
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:14,040
humidity for cannabis curing now this

30
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:17,009
but that a humidity control is a two-way

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,799
control path this is commonly used for

32
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,650
humidity control reason why it's to

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,460
two-way meaning it offers the advantage

34
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,609
of increasing or decreasing the humidity

35
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:31,949
level to try to maintain at 62% as close

36
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:33,599
as it can put here within reason because

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,270
if it's extremely wet or extremely dry

38
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,429
this can only do so much but that

39
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:41,609
two-way control is trying to maintain as

40
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,979
close to that 62% you maybe as possible

41
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:46,289
maybe they're adding humidity or taking

42
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,929
it away from the sealed environment that

43
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,130
we have here in this canning jar now the

44
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,720
importance of media control during the

45
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:53,849
caring is that you want to retain those

46
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,798
terpene levels increase the shelf life

47
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:58,289
maintain the quality and reduce the

48
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,110
chance of mold forming in the buds goals

49
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,990
through proper humidity control and

50
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:06,030
proper drying proper growing process you

51
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:08,728
can end up with a premium quality bud

52
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,090
here that has all the high cannabinoids

53
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,620
and shows the true end product of the

54
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,620
plant in your growing ability
