1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,928
okay here I'm gonna go over some of the

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:06,419
basic in season care for your tomatoes

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:09,480
to ideally get them to turn from green

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:12,120
color to a nice harvestable red that

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,320
your customers will like so in season

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:16,230
care for tomatoes we want to think about

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,469
irrigations is usually a high-value crop

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,230
so typically it warrants irrigation it

9
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,820
is advised I usually recommend drip

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,070
irrigation because it's simple to set up

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,050
able to Hill a very long and extensive

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,609
rows just watch when you're pounding

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,160
them steaks that you know damaged the

14
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,050
lines you're setting up your rows you

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,179
could use overhead irrigation but this

16
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:38,369
is usually recommended as a quick fix

17
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:39,509
and not a permanent solution because of

18
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,939
the wedding of the leaves and the

19
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:44,820
increased chance for certain diseases to

20
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,920
occur I want to be using weed block to

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,469
suppress the weeds on your tomato Rose

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,570
there's many options but in row

23
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,620
protection may help reduce soil splash

24
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,359
as we see here

25
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,399
keep those tomatoes nice and well

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,350
positioned you could see the two drip

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,420
lines located here under the plastic

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,698
eliminating the amount that's lost to

29
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,109
evaporation for ultimate protection

30
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,019
though you might would be considering

31
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,760
in-between real protection we're here

32
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:10,200
we're noticing that where the harvesters

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,020
and caretakers are going to be walking

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,390
there's also some fabric laid down to

35
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,170
help reduce weed pressure there and also

36
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,759
eliminate potential for soil splash

37
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,409
there's a staking and weaving system so

38
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,780
here we see some mistakes you can tie

39
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,450
your Tomatoes up directly to those or a

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,250
wheat those right in between basket

41
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,409
weaving is advised for field to help

42
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,299
support the plants it needs to be set up

43
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,700
shortly after transplant to prevent wind

44
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,729
damage even in this caterpillar tunnel

45
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,290
situation here we want to be mindful of

46
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:42,179
wind that's coming through here which is

47
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,969
good for air circulation but we don't

48
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,640
want to damage our plants last summer

49
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,078
pruning everyone has their own method so

50
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,239
it can be personal preference but

51
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:54,629
typically the 2-litre system is

52
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:57,118
preferred and it has minimal side shoots

53
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,339
so minimum suppers that come out in high

54
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,530
tunnels some people use Eclipse to help

55
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,570
support the tomato crop others will kind

56
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,820
of wrap the tomatoes around that string

57
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,798
there so again personal preference and

58
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,750
exactly how you take care of them the

59
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:14,180
key part is in some way to be supporting

60
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,180
them and pruning them for maximum yield
