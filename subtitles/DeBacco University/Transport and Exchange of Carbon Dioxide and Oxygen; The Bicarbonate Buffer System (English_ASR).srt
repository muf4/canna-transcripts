1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,719
okay here we're gonna look at the

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,330
transport and exchange of carbon dioxide

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,880
and oxygen this occurs through the

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,259
bicarbonate buffer system so when we're

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,910
talking about carbon dioxide being

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,339
carried and red blood cells in exchange

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,230
for oxygen that is what's occurring in

8
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:17,759
the broad sense but here we're gonna

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,278
look a little bit more at the molecular

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,269
level to understand in greater detail

11
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,800
what's actually occurring here now to

12
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:28,439
start off the transport exchange of

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,660
oxygen hemoglobin binds with oxygen

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,850
within red blood cells we see this

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,829
example here here's our hemoglobin it

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,899
also gets moving it and is it's changing

17
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,049
shape in one case we have it

18
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,280
deoxygenated one case oxygen so indeed

19
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,959
actually and there's our oxygenated so

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,558
it does change shape when bound with

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,000
oxygen when this hemoglobin is binding

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,218
then the red blood cells with the oxygen

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,399
this will cause more to diffuse in to

24
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,590
the blood plasma from the blood plasma

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,750
in lungs most hemoglobin molecules carry

26
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,219
a full load of oxygen and that can be

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,320
called our our state as soon as our

28
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,439
relaxed State this is when the

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,430
hemoglobin is fully oxygenated and again

30
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,649
because it's occurring through the

31
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,260
process of diffusion after binding our

32
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,859
oxygen to hemoglobin more can diffuse in

33
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,689
from the blood plasma pH also influences

34
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,629
that a decrease in pH causes greater

35
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:20,728
release of oxygen from hemoglobin why is

36
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,069
that important well as cells metabolize

37
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:25,259
glucose carbon oxide is released into

38
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:28,048
the blood this causes two main things to

39
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,509
happen an increase in the carbon dioxide

40
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,939
pressure of carbon dioxide and hydrogen

41
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,280
ion concentration in capillary blood

42
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:38,008
keep in mind pH stands for the measure

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,019
of hydrogen ions if we're increasing our

44
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,000
hydrogen ion concentration what we're

45
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:45,118
essentially doing is decreasing our pH

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,769
causing acidosis this decreasing pH this

47
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,379
acidic environment can weaken the

48
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:50,429
hemoglobin two oxygen bonds but it's

49
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,589
important that we don't let our blood

50
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,570
get too low or too acidic because that

51
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,990
can completely break apart our ability

52
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,669
to bind oxygen continuing on carbon

53
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,978
dioxide is transported in blood in three

54
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,210
main forms one is dissolved in the

55
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,459
plasma and this only accounts for about

56
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,408
seven to ten percent it can be

57
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,209
chemically bound to hemoglobin since

58
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,599
about 20 percent is carried in red blood

59
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,800
cells so this is for heat complex

60
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,679
molecule here as

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,620
they know you know hemoglobin the vast

62
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,730
majority are 70% is transported as a

63
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,920
bicarbonate ion what does that look like

64
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:27,750
hco3 the minus sign it's a bicarbonate

65
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,879
ion so you could see here someone's

66
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,229
period in the red blood cell here's our

67
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,900
procurement ion dissolved in the plasma

68
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:36,810
as carbonic acid so as the name kind of

69
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,610
implies acidic environment last we have

70
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,240
some carbon oxide dissolved within the

71
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,580
plasma

72
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,629
so this carbonic acid in this acid in

73
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,870
general something we want to keep track

74
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:48,060
of so transport exchange of carbon

75
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,770
dioxide well looking at this kind of

76
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,810
equation here if you're not familiar

77
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,820
with chemistry chemical equations this

78
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,680
arrow means the reaction is continuing

79
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:57,840
this way in a reverse arrow meaning the

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,360
opposite is happening so carbon dioxide

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,939
diffuses in red blood cells and combines

82
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,370
with water to form carbonic acid so

83
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:08,189
here's our carbon dioxide combines with

84
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,469
water to form our carbonic acid so

85
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,300
that's going this way which will quickly

86
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:14,400
dissociate or break apart and do

87
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,530
hydrogen ions in bicarbonate ions and

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,319
it's going this way however in red blood

89
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,390
cells carbonic anhydrase we see here

90
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,579
it's an enzyme and it can reversibly

91
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:26,699
catalyze the conversion of carbon

92
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,070
dioxide and water into carbonic acid so

93
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,799
there's a lot going on here the key part

94
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:35,009
is Kerman oxide in water will break down

95
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,620
foreign form carbon carbonic acid this

96
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:40,049
carbonic acid can break apart or as we

97
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,569
call dissociate into carbonic and

98
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,939
hydrogen ions and this hydrogen ion

99
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:47,459
concentration it gets too high this will

100
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,770
cause a decrease in our blood pH create

101
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,590
a more acidic environment which can be

102
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:55,439
very dangerous to our blood respiratory

103
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,300
and circulatory system so looking at

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,550
here a little more of a pictorial level

105
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,230
at the tissue level by Kerman it quickly

106
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,620
diffuses from red blood cells into the

107
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:06,329
plasma the chloride shift to

108
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,030
counterbalance the out rush of negative

109
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:11,459
bicarbonate ions from red blood cells

110
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,800
chloride ions cl- move from the plasma

111
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,180
into the ever throw sites so what's

112
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,519
going on here we have this exchange of

113
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,699
our negative charges we have our oxygen

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,280
moving this is occurring at the tissue

115
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,050
level that are aspiring so the respiring

116
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,719
for the requiring oxygen that's going

117
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,030
into the cells and as we see carbon

118
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,380
it is leaving now it's leaving and going

119
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:33,119
into different forms here it's funny

120
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,360
with the hemoglobin here it's combining

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,970
with the water to form our carbonate

122
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,000
ions and here's simply dissolving into

123
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,710
the blood plasma so this scan shows you

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,050
pictorially the three different steps

125
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:47,579
that we talked about in this slide here

126
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,740
so it is all chemically bound in

127
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,169
bicarbonate ion we see them all pictured

128
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,840
here oxygen is simply diffusing into the

129
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,330
cells at the lungs these processes are

130
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:59,729
simply reversed here we see our carbon

131
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:01,800
dioxide leaving in our oxygen entering

132
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,720
so by kearney ions moving to the red

133
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,000
blood cells and bind to form with

134
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,420
hydrogen ions to form carbonic acid the

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,430
carbonic acid is then split by carbonic

136
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,439
anhydrase permits an enzyme to release

137
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,019
carbon dioxide in water it's right here

138
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:20,279
this is the enzyme creme nessa can also

139
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,959
diffuse from blood to the alveoli

140
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,509
so this is occurring again the ally

141
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:27,799
within the actual lungs high surface

142
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:29,879
area allowing for this exchange to occur

143
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,860
influence of carbon acid on blood pH

144
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,629
this is the important part the carbonic

145
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,669
acid and by chronic buffer system

146
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:37,740
resistant blood pH changes this is a

147
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,299
good thing this is that buffer system we

148
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,790
have the acid in the bicarbonate kind of

149
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,379
playing off one another if hydrogen ion

150
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:46,140
concentration is Noble I begin to rise

151
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,689
which is excessive hydrogen ions being

152
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:52,409
added to the system they can be removed

153
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:54,089
by combining with this car Bernie if

154
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,040
hydrogen ion concentrations begin to

155
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:58,829
drop carbonic acid can dissociate

156
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,930
releasing the heavier ions so because we

157
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:03,180
have a way to post take in excessive

158
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,250
hundred ions and also release hydrogen

159
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,500
ions this is how we develop this buffer

160
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,790
system here we're able to buffer the

161
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,829
system right over to if something gets

162
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,629
too high we can bring it down and then

163
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,728
it gets down we can dart bringing it up

164
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:18,659
this is maintaining our blood pH and

165
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:21,659
approximately that 7.35 to 7.45 level

166
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,810
very tight control lastly or a

167
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,660
respiratory rate can change can also

168
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,639
alter our blood pH it's important

169
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,560
provides fast-acting system to adjust pH

170
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,839
when it's disturbed by metabolic factors

171
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,728
we're going for a quick run in the burst

172
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,038
of energy that can potentially shift our

173
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:40,199
pH we need a way to quickly be able to

174
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:41,430
correct that and prevent it from getting

175
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,800
outside

176
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,319
normal range as it does we could have

177
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,819
our protein cap function properly we

178
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,560
could have reduced oxygen levels to

179
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,269
certain parts of the body and all

180
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,819
negative things could basically happen

181
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:56,729
if this buffer system was to fail you

182
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,129
keep in mind we have this bicarbonate

183
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,080
buffer system and this carbon acid and

184
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,879
oxygen exchange that's occurring and

185
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,109
hopefully now you can appreciate what's

186
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,709
occurring a little bit more at the

187
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,710
molecular level
