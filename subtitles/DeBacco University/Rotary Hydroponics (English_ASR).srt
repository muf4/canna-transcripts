1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,379
now here we're going to look at rotary

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,068
hydroponics which is as the name implies

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,689
applies a wheel that rotates around a

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,550
central light source here

5
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:13,529
so there's nutrient solution in the

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,109
bottom and this rotates through very

7
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,789
slowly and allows the plants to get that

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,710
full exposure and doesn't need a

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,109
reflector on that light that's giving

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,350
that 360 degrees of light for the

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,820
operation now the ferris wheel concept

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,949
is kind of the idea to think about or

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,649
document these rotary systems the goal

14
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,570
is to maximize space in light use and a

15
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:35,640
very small footprint ideally get a big

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,230
yield while the speed rotation is slow

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,640
you can still see it and I try to show

18
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:42,259
that here where we can kind of see the

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,820
world turning but it's very slow in the

20
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:47,759
rotation that it does this is the same

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,980
concept here as the rotary form of

22
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,628
hydroponics overall this is not

23
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,519
well-suited for a large-scale production

24
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:55,198
it's not a good option for plants that

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,390
grow very tall because they're limited

26
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,339
and as a result sadly this isn't very

27
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,409
practical so let me look really cool

28
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,149
interesting we could see all the root

29
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:04,978
systems here going right around and

30
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,260
being picked up that nutrient solution

31
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,938
not very practical and if plants are

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,560
growing very tall well they're gonna run

33
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:13,048
into the light and get tangled and then

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,118
cause all sorts of issues so again very

35
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,280
limited on what it can be produced for

36
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,769
does look kind of neat and does allow to

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,629
maximize it footprint but again not

38
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,530
great for large scale operations and

39
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:24,530
really not widely used
