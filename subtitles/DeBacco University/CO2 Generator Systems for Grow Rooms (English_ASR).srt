1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,799
so here we'll take a brief overview of

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,799
co2 generator systems for grow rooms or

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,780
grow facilities as co2 generator systems

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,660
are typically looking at burning

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:14,730
something here to generate co2 we're not

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,460
using compressed and bottled co2 for

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,289
example so co2 generate systems they

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,089
burn natural gas or propane to produce

9
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,189
carbon dioxide and these are less

10
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,539
expensive than emitter systems so

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,910
emitter systems will simply have

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,880
compressed co2 in a bottle and deliver

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,649
that to a grow room here we're using a

14
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:35,219
propane or natural gas or a burner

15
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,289
system and using that to then through

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,289
the burning process releasing co2 as a

17
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,359
by-product into the facility now however

18
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,460
these produce heat so these burner

19
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,719
systems it's important to make know that

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,939
they are going to produce heat so that

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,620
could be an issue depending on the

22
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,170
lighting and other setups you may have

23
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,299
in addition water is an additional

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,399
by-product through the combustion that's

25
00:00:54,299 --> 00:01:00,179
occurring to generate the targeted co2

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,480
gas so this can cause high humidity an

27
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:05,640
area increased heat so for certain

28
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,560
operations these might be ideal if you

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,420
have a cold environment that is

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,859
typically low humidity but if you

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,478
already have a warm environment that

32
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:15,359
you're trying to regulate in maintaining

33
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:18,030
humidity levels this could cause some

34
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,700
issues there so again just important to

35
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,650
consider this as an option it's great

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,079
for some operations not great for others

37
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,118
if you are using this generator system

38
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,989
keep in mind your controller should not

39
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:34,859
have fuzzy logic enabled to allow for

40
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:39,319
efficient dosage of these co2 and heat

41
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,319
systems for your growing plants
