1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
here we're looking at gunshot residue

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,879
now you may not think

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,959
initial fire bullet is fired how much

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,320
residue is actually exposed around the

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
gun but this kind of

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,359
freeze-frame high-speed shot shows the

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,638
bullet in motion

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,960
shows the fire still coming out of the

9
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,600
barrel and does show the residue

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,800
and keep in mind this is a revolver here

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
so there can be a little bit more

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,199
because we have that firing chamber

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,719
curve right in the

14
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,199
cylinder here so gunshot residue

15
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,079
a lot of times abbreviated gsr is a

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,559
mixture of material

17
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,519
that originates from the firing of a gun

18
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,519
and it's

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,359
residue that is deposited on the hands

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,239
and clothes of someone who discharges

21
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,719
the firearm

22
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,000
and really anything nearby residue can

23
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,399
be found on both the firearm

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,439
and the individual and this again shows

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,480
another revolver

26
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:51,039
kind of shows the angle of projection

27
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,959
of that residue and here's the bullet

28
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,760
again caught right in motion right there

29
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,679
it gives you a good

30
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:00,238
idea of just where this may be deposited

31
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,920
now gunshot residue is principally

32
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,358
composed of burnt and unburnt particles

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,159
from the explosive primer and the

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,600
propellant

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
there's also the possibility of

36
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,158
fragments of the bullet cartridge case

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,920
and the firearm present so it's not just

38
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,799
to say just a propellant we see here

39
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,879
with the smoke

40
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,240
there could also be a chance that there

41
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,560
could be some of that cartridge case

42
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,560
some of the actual bullet component

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
so these are other things to be mindful

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
of when you're evaluating

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,240
a scene for gunshot residue now the

46
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,078
collection

47
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,719
of said gunshot residue the process in

48
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:32,000
general

49
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,359
we're looking at investigators should

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,879
use gloves to limit potential

51
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,319
contamination of the scene because we

52
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,118
are looking at something that is very

53
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,519
fine

54
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,799
and is found in very small quantities

55
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,478
investigators should test the clothing

56
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,920
and skin of people for gunshot residue

57
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,519
to determine if they were near the gun

58
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,519
when it was discharged

59
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,759
as you saw with those images you can see

60
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,118
here it's not just around the gun there

61
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,840
is some

62
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,438
expansion of that at least near the site

63
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,840
of that initial explosion

64
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,959
the gunshot residue can travel about

65
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
over three to five

66
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,438
feet from the gun or about one one and a

67
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,078
half meters away from the gun

68
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,279
but keep in mind at those first kind of

69
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,840
ranges of that

70
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,439
only very few trace particles might be

71
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,239
present so it's gonna be very hard to

72
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,840
find those

73
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,200
that's why it's important to try to

74
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,640
pinpoint where the gun was actually

75
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,238
fired

76
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,679
now in that gunshot residue in the if

77
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,840
you go through and you go

78
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,040
bring it into a lab and analyze it we're

79
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,200
going to be looking for

80
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,719
elements such as barium antimony these

81
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,359
are typically found at high levels

82
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,639
you want to use a powerful microscope in

83
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,080
this case this scanning electron

84
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,719
microscope can help kind of

85
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
look for that residue that might be

86
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,759
present and there's other chemical tests

87
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
to determine what elements might be

88
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,840
present

89
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,039
and making the match well the if the

90
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,878
ammunition used

91
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,799
was specifically tagged in some way with

92
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,079
special elements it's possible to know

93
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
the cartridge used to produce the

94
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,040
gunshot residue using scanning electron

95
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,239
microscopes or dispersive x-ray

96
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,439
spectrometry

97
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,519
can also help her aid in this process

98
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,359
the whole goal of going through this

99
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,080
process is to match the bullet to the

100
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
gun

101
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
to be able to try to determine or start

102
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,000
developing

103
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,238
links of what occurred at the crime

104
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,120
scene to what materials were used

105
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,120
at the crime scene
