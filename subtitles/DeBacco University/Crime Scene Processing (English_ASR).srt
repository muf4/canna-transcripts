1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,520
okay in this video on tobacco university

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,278
we're going to be looking at crime scene

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,240
processing or at least a general

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:08,800
overview

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,679
of the how you would process a crime

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,160
scene

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,240
so starting with the processing scene

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,960
main objectives well the first is always

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,839
safety

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,600
i want to be sure be maintaining a safe

11
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,519
conditions no matter what the scene is

12
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,679
and that's going to vary depending on

13
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,599
what scene you may approach or what

14
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,960
scene you might be investigating also

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,559
the degree of knowledge of your

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,199
understanding of what's going on at the

17
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,320
scene

18
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,480
regardless you want to make sure you're

19
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,679
securing the scene

20
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,679
in some cases you might want to be

21
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,960
keeping a safer distance if we have for

22
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,439
example here

23
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,759
a car on fire otherwise you want to

24
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,718
prevent people from entering or exiting

25
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,558
a scene because it's going to include

26
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,000
just more variability potentially for

27
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,759
the data that you're going to collect

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,119
you want to maintain that protection of

29
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,479
the scene you just wanted to secure it

30
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,119
but you also have someone kind of

31
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,398
out looking to make sure no one is

32
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,358
unwillingly entering

33
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,039
that scene your next job should go

34
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,719
through in photography

35
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,558
to look at documenting the scene with

36
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,879
images making a sketch

37
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,560
particularly for talking seeing where

38
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,158
there might be a body located

39
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,000
want to be sure you're taking notes and

40
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,240
taking pretty well detailed notes as

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,759
well collecting labeling and packaging

42
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,280
any evidence you come across

43
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,879
and then ultimately you'll be writing a

44
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,719
report for this

45
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,359
so when we're looking at that safety in

46
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,200
particular that safety being first

47
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,040
we're looking at each scene is unique so

48
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
be attended and keep in mind of your own

49
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,280
safety obvious things such as glass and

50
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,840
sharp objects but there can also be

51
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,000
trip hazards unstable objects and you're

52
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,079
not sure exactly what you're entering

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,078
so always make sure you're maintaining

54
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:41,759
your own security and safety

55
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,078
so you don't become a part of the scene

56
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
yourself then you want to secure that

57
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,798
crime scene so as i said

58
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
the first officer at the crime scene is

59
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,320
responsible for securing and protecting

60
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
the area using the crime scene tape and

61
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,758
other physical barriers

62
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
the victim is alive medics should be

63
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,399
called and they would be allowed to

64
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,759
enter the scene of course

65
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,960
the goal is not to compromise the

66
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
evidence in any way that's why you're

67
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,919
securing and locking down that area

68
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,560
if a witness or witnesses are present

69
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,320
make sure

70
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,719
they do not leave the scenes you want to

71
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,399
get their report before they go off

72
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,840
and are lost potentially because they

73
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,000
can be great sources

74
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
of information when you're protecting

75
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,840
that scene this is a very important

76
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,080
step anyone who enters the scene has a

77
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,840
potential to destroy physical evidence

78
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
often damage may be unintentional so

79
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,959
keep that in mind that someone might

80
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
dance in the scene to intentionally do

81
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,439
anything

82
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,280
but unintentionally they can do a lot of

83
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,079
damage to the evidence collection

84
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,199
process

85
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,719
everyone should be excluded from the

86
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,318
scene including police officers not

87
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,959
directly involved in the process of the

88
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,000
site or

89
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,920
investigation that investigator that

90
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,680
maine crime scene investigator has

91
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,280
only a limited amount of time to work

92
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,239
and must complete the falling of the

93
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,239
crime scene

94
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,000
must be taking photographs providing a

95
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,239
sketch making notes collecting

96
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,120
document and packaging evidence so it's

97
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,480
a lot to do

98
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,400
and it always seems like there's never

99
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,759
enough time to get it done

100
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,879
when you're taking photographs you want

101
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,878
to make sure that there's of the

102
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,878
unaltered scene because objects must

103
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,280
remain untouched until photographed

104
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,079
if evidence has been removed or moved it

105
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,239
must be

106
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
mentioned in the actual report you can't

107
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,039
just have that

108
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,239
kind of having moving things and then

109
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,158
assuming that's where it was originally

110
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,719
found that should be evidence and noted

111
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,399
in the report process any proof of the

112
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,400
crime scene was compromised would cause

113
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,439
the evidence to be admissible in court

114
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,879
that's really the main thing you're

115
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,639
trying to protect and make sure all the

116
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,239
evidence you're collecting is able to be

117
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,639
used in court

118
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,680
now crime scene photography basics so

119
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,199
some of the

120
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,200
basics for photography there are other

121
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,878
videos mentioning them in more detail

122
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,039
investigators should be thought of

123
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,399
taking care of photographs in all areas

124
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,878
where the crime took place

125
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
and likely entry and exit points

126
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:41,919
remember to include

127
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,759
different angles and as you can see here

128
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,318
in the images included we see the eiffel

129
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,479
tower

130
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,000
presented at different angles it's

131
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,679
important to have establishing medium

132
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,120
range close-up and macroscopic

133
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,640
photographs if you're interested in

134
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,599
learning more about those there's a

135
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,359
specific video

136
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,719
on that all images should include a

137
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,480
ruler as a size reference to help

138
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,959
establish the general size of the

139
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,359
objects that's being documented

140
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,719
now the sketch basics so after

141
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,879
photographs are taken a sketch of the

142
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,719
crime scene should be generated

143
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,079
on a scene a rough sketch will be made

144
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,919
after leaving the scene

145
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,000
part of the processing phase is

146
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,079
developing a finished or final sketch

147
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,120
that is precise recreation of the scene

148
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,439
but while you're there you won't at

149
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,879
least want to get a rough sketch in

150
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,399
all sketches remember we'll need a

151
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,079
legend showing where certain items the

152
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,959
crime scene are located and also

153
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,959
indicating

154
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,439
where north is as well be sure you

155
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,198
include that in all sketches

156
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,560
general requirements looking at sketches

157
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,160
well of course you need to have a title

158
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
a legend for any abbreviations or

159
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,600
symbols that are used

160
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,799
compass direction showing at least the

161
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
northern direction

162
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,800
a scale and documentation with at least

163
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,560
location date and time

164
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,720
in the creator's name so make sure these

165
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,439
are also present in any sketches

166
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,120
created here are some just general

167
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,639
sketch examples just to give you an idea

168
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,399
of the legend and how things may be

169
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,600
oriented

170
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,198
always want to be sure that you're

171
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
documenting some of the important pieces

172
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,600
of evidence that might be found

173
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,120
entry points exit points uh distances so

174
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
these are all very important things to

175
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,918
be documenting and including

176
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,599
on the sketch here now remember we

177
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,719
should be taking notes as well

178
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
and these notes should include the

179
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,759
location of the crime scene the date and

180
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,918
time of notification and

181
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,680
information received and who it was from

182
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,560
the time of your arrival in your

183
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,319
departure

184
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,959
scene details will be more on the next

185
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,439
slide and a description of the victim

186
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,279
in names of the investigation team again

187
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,279
it's a lot to kind of take in in a very

188
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,439
short period of time so this is why

189
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,879
having an idea what you need to include

190
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,079
and making sure you're getting all this

191
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,519
in a relatively

192
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,758
efficient manner is very important

193
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,519
so lastly looking here at the detailed

194
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,439
description of the scene

195
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,198
well in this example we're looking at

196
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,478
this is of particular importance for

197
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,520
physical evidence

198
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,879
at the scene and for each item the

199
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,000
following should be documented you want

200
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,719
to make sure you're getting the time of

201
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,639
discovery

202
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,560
who discovered it how it was packaged

203
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,240
and labeled in a description of that

204
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,879
item because these will likely be need

205
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,680
to refer

206
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,478
to as further investigations are being

207
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,319
conducted

208
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,680
to better tell the story of what

209
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,680
happened at the crime scene
