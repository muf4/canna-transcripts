1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,678
if you're interested in learning more

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,440
about outdoor cannabis production

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,439
to come to the right place here i'm

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,519
going to go over some of the key aspects

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,559
and considerations if you're looking at

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,570
growing your cannabis

7
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:21,519
outdoors here on debaco university

8
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:22,879
[Music]

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,559
all right let's get into some of the

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,679
considerations for outdoor cannabis

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,079
production

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,000
so the outdoor environment in general

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,000
can be very challenging there's many

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
aspects that are out of your control so

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,558
be sure to maximize the conditions that

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,280
you do

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,320
have control over soil evaluation and

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,800
modifications

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,480
are important or controlled aspects with

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,679
outdoor production and this could be in

21
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,159
a field situation

22
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,719
or it can be even in kind of like a soil

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,238
in these

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,759
fabric pot containers that are growing

25
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,839
in an outdoor environment

26
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,198
be sure you have all the basics covered

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,719
you want to know what plant type you're

28
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,839
going to be growing what nutrients

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,439
you're going to be using

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,440
and how you're going to properly

31
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,839
irrigate the plants

32
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,439
now outdoor growing a scouting is very

33
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,400
important there are many unknown

34
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,319
variables

35
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,799
so be sure to take a look out for

36
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,559
anything that is out of the ordinary

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,920
and this can be looking at the soil this

38
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
can be looking at after they're planted

39
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,879
scouting for insects getting for

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,240
potential for disease also looking at

41
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,879
just the general area what weeds are

42
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,199
growing in

43
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,719
in a particular area there are a lot of

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,118
trees a lot of stumps so there's things

45
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,359
to consider rocks for example

46
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,319
all variables that people want to take

47
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,519
into consideration

48
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,519
if you're looking at growing your

49
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,280
cannabis outdoors

50
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,200
now a simplified outdoor growing

51
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,439
checklist and again it can be very

52
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,040
variable and there'll be a plethora of

53
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,438
videos here on this channel

54
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,159
to help cover some of these main topics

55
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,319
so you can learn

56
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,000
about it in more detail we want to do a

57
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,158
general site evaluation you want to like

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
look at a site and kind of evaluate it

59
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,280
look at the hills look at the area look

60
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,200
at the drainage

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
prepping the field once you decide on a

62
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,159
site how do you go about that

63
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,719
the plant layout how you're going to

64
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,920
organize your plants properly taking a

65
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,519
soil test

66
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
not only properly taking the soil test

67
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,519
but getting that soil test and

68
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
results in interpreting that soil test

69
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,759
are important

70
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,360
weed management because they're always

71
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,679
going to be weeds are going to grow and

72
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
then

73
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,039
irrigation are all important

74
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,720
considerations when we're looking at the

75
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,120
outdoor environment

76
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,199
now that site evaluation well

77
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,520
identifying the fields section

78
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,399
allocating subsections you need to soil

79
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
sample areas

80
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,680
differently are going to be planting one

81
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,519
area earlier than another is there a

82
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
change in topography a change in soil

83
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
type

84
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,159
all these need to be a part of your site

85
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
evaluation

86
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,239
for your cannabis production then it

87
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,919
gets into field prep so potentially

88
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,039
using a cover crop as we see here you

89
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,679
know if you're able to get into the site

90
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,840
early

91
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,200
uh prepping that with having a good root

92
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,120
structure here for cover crop

93
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,598
preparing the biology preparing the soil

94
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,159
structure for your cannabis crop to come

95
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,759
later then i said plant layout you can

96
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,719
see here what's going to be your plant

97
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,479
spacing

98
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,919
what's your plant density per thousand

99
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,399
square feet per acre

100
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,000
what's your row orientation and that

101
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
could deal with the kind of the change

102
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,719
in topography of the land the angle of

103
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,399
the sun

104
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,158
different tree lines what's going to be

105
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,519
your seeding rate

106
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:08,799
and what's going to be your planting

107
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,319
date and are going to use seeds are

108
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
going to use clones all important

109
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,359
considerations

110
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,239
now when you're taking a soil test you

111
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
want to make sure you're following the

112
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,360
proper methods

113
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,879
for a mineral test and then if you're

114
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,319
taking a june nitrate test

115
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,280
slightly different methods for that so

116
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:21,919
you want to make sure you're going

117
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,598
through

118
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,119
and reading those protocols ahead of

119
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,598
time and making sure you're

120
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,239
properly sampling the soil for the

121
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,598
intest

122
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,360
that you're going to be sending that

123
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,798
sample out for

124
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,200
now when you get that sample results

125
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,680
back hopefully if you took a good sample

126
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,639
you'll get some field representative or

127
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,959
growers often say quote accurate results

128
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,759
looking at ph organic matter salt

129
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,400
particle size potentially for nitrogen

130
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,280
phosphorus potassium micro nutrients in

131
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
cec

132
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
cation exchange capacity they'll come

133
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
back in a soil test that might look

134
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,518
something like this

135
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
so how you go about interpreting the

136
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,959
soil test and what adjustments you make

137
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
are going to be important

138
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,239
to ensure that your canvas plants have a

139
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
good

140
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
start and a good environment to support

141
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,920
their growth

142
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,840
now to want to have good cannabis plants

143
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,238
and good growing cannabis plants

144
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
weeds are also going to be a problem

145
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
most likely so you want to be sure you

146
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
have

147
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,519
in-row weed management as we can see

148
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,160
here with use of black plastic

149
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,600
but also between row management so we're

150
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,600
maximizing the production

151
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,520
of the crop that we intend to grow and

152
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,479
not getting bogged down in

153
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,478
example here with some grass species and

154
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,478
lastly we want to be considerate of

155
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,240
irrigation what type how are we going to

156
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,519
get water to our plants or use a drip

157
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,079
irrigation system

158
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,758
or use an overhead irrigation system we

159
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,879
can't always depend or rely

160
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,800
on the rain great ways with to be have

161
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,639
some method so we can supplement water

162
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
if we need to particularly on

163
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,400
a high value crop such as cannabis so

164
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,319
hopefully this didn't scare you away

165
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,239
from any outdoor productions

166
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,079
in the sense that there are a lot of

167
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
things that growers need to be aware of

168
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,879
even the outdoor applications

169
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,639
not just to get all the free energy from

170
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,240
the sun is plant and walk away

171
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,120
to maximize that harvest these are

172
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,079
