1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,379
welcome to this debaco University video

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,599
where we're going to be looking at

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,699
lollipop pruning options for cannabis

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,160
whether you're keeping or removing the

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,079
side branches we could see here showing

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,339
in a comparison of two plants I'm going

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,960
to walk you through some of the details

8
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,179
and we'll go out to the greenhouse and

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,219
Care will show us the comparison of

10
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,219
those two plants she's sitting next to

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,900
[Music]

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,820
so first off lollipop pruning's

13
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,979
definition is that live hopscreen

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,079
really's goal is to focus the plant's

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,479
energy on the top part by removing the

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,640
lower branches resulting in a lollipop

17
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,679
appearance so you can see with a kind of

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,179
a plant would look like initially remove

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,759
these lower branches you're kind of

20
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,679
focusing that energy towards the top

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,179
portion now it says removing the lower

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,058
branches these are typically referring

23
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,979
to the ones closest to the container or

24
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:57,899
ground level there are some more

25
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:59,640
aggressive versions of that as we'll see

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,219
a comparison here

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,600
now there is a Botanical support for

28
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,599
this method and it's why it's

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,579
implemented quite a bit of the plant

30
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,559
portions that simply receive less light

31
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,780
intensity are typically poor

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,340
contributors to the plant so by removing

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,500
the lower branches and leaves of the

34
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,780
cannabis plants this increases the

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,879
overall plant efficiency but looking at

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,439
these six Buds here these would be more

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,839
towards the top receiving more light

38
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,239
typically in these popcorn or smaller

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,700
size buds B grade buds will be more

40
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,399
towards the sides simply receiving less

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,978
light on those side branches

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,240
now the benefit of the lollipop method

43
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,340
is that with the lower portions of the

44
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,618
plant removed this can help increase air

45
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,420
flow and help reduce the potential for

46
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,340
disease pressure so not only does it

47
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,439
benefit what more plant materials

48
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,960
getting more of the light it can also

49
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,099
help increase your airflow Under The

50
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,259
Canopy

51
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:55,259
now the general lollipopping process

52
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,938
this is well the best time it really

53
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,739
depends on the cultivar you're choosing

54
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:00,419
to grow in the environment typically

55
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:03,060
this is done in the late vegetative

56
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,460
stage or early flowering stage in

57
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,320
generally about 15 days before and 15

58
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,399
days after flowering is the critical

59
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,618
window and you want to be really

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,360
implementing this method or committing

61
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,979
to this method if you are going with the

62
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,840
screen of green or scrog method as we

63
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,939
can see implemented right here you're

64
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,800
likely doing a form of lollipopping

65
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,919
already just kind of keeping everything

66
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,080
on that same level there with the screen

67
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,818
method in particular

68
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,620
now indoor or outdoor growing where

69
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:30,659
would you implement this it can be used

70
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,420
in both situations but since the sun

71
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,219
travels across the sky it's less benefit

72
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,679
this is a less beneficial printing

73
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,719
method indoor applications or others

74
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,700
that have less degrees of light that

75
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,139
travel tend to benefit more from this

76
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,139
method because you're kind of focusing

77
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:48,238
more in a particular region

78
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:51,119
now two different takes on basically

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,980
this same method here traditionally

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,259
Growers like to Simply remove the leaves

81
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,639
and keep most of the side branches and

82
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,579
the exact amount really is up to the

83
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,199
grower in unconventional method kind of

84
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,300
more shown here is where the side

85
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,459
branches are completely removed which

86
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,219
will result in a plant that represents

87
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,900
more of a palm tree this does result in

88
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,840
a thicker Central stock but still

89
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,939
requires staking if the plant is topped

90
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,920
and then cut down the apical meristem is

91
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,840
removed it can have a similar number of

92
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,818
growing tips compared to the traditional

93
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,500
method

94
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:24,419
now the traditional method is I'm kind

95
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,158
of using here is again this maximizes

96
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,039
the branch meristems which should in

97
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:31,560
theory result in many buds however the

98
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,179
bud size may be reduced if all branches

99
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,280
are kept for the full plant cycle

100
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,400
keeping four main branches will probably

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,500
give you the highest amount of a quality

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,060
buds more you keep you are going to

103
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,799
start to see a reduction in size because

104
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,640
the plate can only produce so much

105
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,620
energy

106
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,539
this is an easy method to employ

107
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,879
intensity best when implemented with

108
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,620
some form of screen of green method

109
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,579
where you're keeping all of these

110
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,378
branches

111
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,900
now the unconventional methods that kind

112
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,518
of shown here in tight plant spacing

113
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,980
this does allow for improved airflow

114
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,299
under the plants trimming can also be a

115
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:05,039
little bit more difficult and this does

116
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,120
require more frequent prunings of the

117
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,979
side branches because you are going

118
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,480
through and removing all of those side

119
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,459
branches you can see even at this small

120
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,859
stage the importance of plant staking

121
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,120
because the plants will be top heavy but

122
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,160
the main stem that you will notice will

123
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,139
thicken to help support the structure

124
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,120
compared to if you were keeping all of

125
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,978
those side branches

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,180
now just to kind of a recommendation

127
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,459
here if you're going with the

128
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,079
traditional method use this in most

129
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:29,459
cases especially if utilizing the screen

130
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,439
of green method where you're keeping all

131
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:32,758
those branches the unconventional method

132
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,800
here where you're really removing a lot

133
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,180
of those side branches best Implement if

134
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
you're looking to clone a plant because

135
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,100
you can take those side branches off and

136
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,560
clone those remove the side shoots with

137
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,240
the timing of plant growth and also be

138
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,759
careful when you're choosing to top that

139
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,019
plant remove that apical meristem and

140
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,759
you will get a consistent number of

141
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,399
clones and be able to harvest the mother

142
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,900
plant even though the yield will most

143
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,879
likely be lower than the traditional

144
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,219
method depending how aggressive you are

145
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,800
with the side shoots and branches you're

146
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,300
removing and limiting the plant too

147
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,680
so here we're going to go out to the

148
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,180
greenhouse there and here's going to

149
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,000
show us in the greenhouse in comparison

150
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,860
to two lollipopping methods with plants

151
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,199
nearing the end of the vegetative cycle

152
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,479
this allows you to see both and make an

153
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,439
informed decision on what method you

154
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:18,240
would like to implement in your

155
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,680
operation and keep in mind this is in

156
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,379
the greenhouse these are fairly large

157
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,579
plants but we'll go out to Kiera and

158
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:29,459
hear her comparison of these two methods

159
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,740
hi So today we're back at DG AG Tech

160
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:34,918
comparing two different forms of

161
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,840
Lollipop pruning on my right we have a

162
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,538
much more intensive form of this

163
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,819
lollipop grooming as you can see many of

164
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:45,240
the branches are missing in comparison

165
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:48,538
to this other one and we have just a

166
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,060
much wider and larger bigger stock here

167
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:53,759
in comparison to this one now this one

168
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,459
just has the leaves taken off of all of

169
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,860
the branches as opposed to taking all of

170
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:00,839
the branches off like this one we can

171
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,379
see this has a little bit of a thinner

172
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,299
branch in the middle but more branches

173
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,759
coming out the side more yield up on the

174
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,100
top which will need eventually more

175
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,979
support than if you were to just do it

176
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,660
this way but the con with this way is

177
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:17,699
that after a while you can see that it

178
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,860
starts getting pretty top heavy so

179
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,620
you're going to need support using

180
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,780
netting either way our yield at the top

181
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,819
is pretty similar as you can see we

182
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,918
don't have big differences just based on

183
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,020
this pruning method so at the end of the

184
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:33,719
day it is really up to you as a grower

185
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:36,120
to decide what best fits your operation

186
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,479
when it comes to pruning each of your

187
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,478
plants
