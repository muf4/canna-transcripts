1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,679
if you're growing in a small grow space

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,080
and want a very simple

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,199
way of adding carbon dioxide to your

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,679
area

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,960
looking at point injection behind a fan

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,199
is a great way to

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,000
easily add carbon dioxide to your grow

8
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,919
space

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,519
and here at tobacco university i'll

10
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,929
describe some of the details with

11
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,100
utilizing this method

12
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,100
[Music]

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,480
let's get into the video looking at

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,760
point injection behind a fan for carbon

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,960
dioxide delivery

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,880
for cannabis production so this point

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,600
injection behind a fan pretty simple

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
method

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,200
the sense that it's very simple to

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,519
assemble

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,960
and also very cost effective mainly

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,320
because most likely you have a fan your

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
grow area anyway

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,759
so adding the point injection behind the

25
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,679
fan just will help

26
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,960
increase the efficiency of its

27
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,719
distribution

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,719
in larger rooms there should be multiple

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
points of injection but this can help

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,679
ensure that there is a more even

31
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,038
distribution with equipment

32
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,920
that's likely already in place in your

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,320
facility now an oscillating fan would be

34
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,079
of course

35
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,158
the best option because while any fan

36
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,760
will help disperse carbon dioxide

37
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,520
using an oscillating fan will help

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,439
disperse the gas evenly

39
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,438
even more efficiently across the grow

40
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,000
space now keep in mind chromaxine will

41
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:19,758
want to

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,359
sink in the grow space so if you're

43
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,319
injecting at a higher point in mixing it

44
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,319
around this way

45
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,679
as it naturally wants to fall down

46
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,959
through the grow space it'll actually

47
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,040
fall through the plants

48
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,000
and be naturally dispersed through them

49
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,680
allowing for a very efficient uptake

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
now the direction of the fan so fans

51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,600
should be dispersing

52
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,359
air across the tops of the plants so

53
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,280
again that co2 can fall through the

54
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,280
plants because it's heavier than air

55
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,960
however be mindful of the placement of

56
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,000
the exhaust system

57
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,679
you want to be injecting your co2 maybe

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
to higher up the canopy but you don't

59
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
want to have it right next to your

60
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,959
exhaust system you want to have that a

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,478
separate area

62
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,078
so that the co2 will naturally want to

63
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,280
fall down and your exhaust will pull out

64
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,798
the hotter air

65
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,200
and limit the amount of co2 that's

66
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,000
wasted by going out your exhaust system

67
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,478
for cooling

68
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,438
the plants now the placement of the

69
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:06,798
sensor

70
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,719
with this system as we can see here

71
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,920
another fan being utilized

72
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,598
and when deciding where to place the

73
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,479
sensor it should be about one half to

74
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,399
two thirds

75
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,399
of the travel distance of the air moved

76
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,319
by the fan this will help provide an

77
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,439
overall carbon dioxide concentration in

78
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:20,958
the grow space

79
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,878
you don't want it too close or too far

80
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,479
away kind of trying to get that

81
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,039
average reading that the plants are

82
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,639
experiencing so as your controller

83
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,560
is monitoring those levels and trying to

84
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,598
maintain certain levels it's the average

85
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,159
level the plants will be

86
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,039
exposed to to help allow for a very

87
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,280
efficient

88
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,719
growing operation with carbon dioxide

89
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,039
enrichment but always

90
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,000
make sure no other factors are limiting

91
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,560
to get the best

92
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,759
benefit from enriching your growth space

93
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,759
with carbon dioxide
