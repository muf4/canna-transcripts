1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,120
okay in this debaco university video i'm

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:08,638
gonna be exploring what the filos's

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,800
galaxy public database can tell you

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,839
and kind of the information you can gain

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,400
from it that you have

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,000
access to so it's a great way to kind of

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,359
spend some time researching some strains

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,679
you might be familiar with

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,118
and also discovering some new ones so

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,679
it's just a good uh

11
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,679
to have an idea of the power or what

12
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,160
it's able to actually show you

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,239
so first off this is a link to the

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,920
website here and i want to make note

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,519
that it may take a little time to load

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,120
but it is worth the wait

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,320
your browser may take a little time to

18
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,359
kind of maintenance do you want to wait

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,359
and the answer is

20
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,920
yes i always tell people it takes about

21
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,359
like 30 seconds potentially to load

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,039
usually it's a little bit less than that

23
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,799
but just be patient with

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,200
letting it load because it is loading a

25
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,718
lot of information

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
so we're here i'm just going to give an

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,960
example kind of go through and i chose

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
to look at none other than

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
charlotte's web and we can clearly see

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
that the

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,079
um you know it's been shown to reduce

32
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,760
epilepsies have another video describing

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,920
some of the story so here we're just

34
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,079
going to look at one two three the four

35
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,680
uh that i put little highlights around

36
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,920
here that you can search

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,118
on charlotte's web here within the

38
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,478
finals galaxy

39
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,040
now what's interesting is while these

40
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,759
are all listed at charlotte's web from

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,799
different um people that submitted it

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,000
different companies that may have

43
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,560
submitted it they

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,560
also have very different results so it's

45
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,280
important to be an informed consumer as

46
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,879
well

47
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,719
so this is just looking at you know some

48
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,000
of the information that is provided

49
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,599
there again looking at our charlotte's

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,319
web i have the links to all these right

51
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,158
here

52
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,039
and we can see i keep them in the same

53
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,359
order here with the the four listed here

54
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,159
now with these four that were submitted

55
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,920
by different

56
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
companies or people one's listed just as

57
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,680
anonymous looking at the closest

58
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
genetic relative so you can see some

59
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,118
have a very diversified set of genetic

60
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,560
relatives

61
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,759
some very simplified here there's 58

62
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,280
4 11 and 2 relatives so what are other

63
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,799
strings related to this can help

64
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,718
start to develop a general idea of the

65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,880
strains most closely related

66
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,078
some listed here have as few as two and

67
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,519
as many as

68
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:12,079
58 so again very diversified here

69
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,760
in looking at potential for closeness in

70
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,400
genetic relatives

71
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,439
then if we look here at the kind of the

72
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
population

73
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,639
profile here where we're looking at kind

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,560
of

75
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:27,759
this example here of cbd skunk berry

76
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,920
og kush mini hemp

77
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,359
you know what's kind of in that well

78
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,159
this indicates the heritage of the

79
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,160
samples

80
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,680
what may be related to based on the

81
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,919
genetic profile

82
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,360
one sample has nearly a complete

83
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,759
relation of

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,280
to cbd population while others have

85
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,518
almost no relation

86
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,400
we could see this one here definitely

87
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,640
high on

88
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
cbd and a very little skunk in

89
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,958
comparison this one over

90
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,840
here there's that cbd is that very thin

91
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,519
little line

92
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,560
uh right there so very different here in

93
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,039
the genotype

94
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,158
report even though they all are listed

95
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,799
as charlotte's

96
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,000
web i'm sorry if you're colorblind might

97
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
be a little hard to distinguish

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,439
some of these colors but we can clearly

99
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
hopefully see that there's

100
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,239
one really large bar here and that same

101
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,720
bar is obtained by the very thin bar

102
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,719
right over here then we get to genetic

103
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,639
novelty and this provides an idea of how

104
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,158
unique or rare the genetics are compared

105
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,000
to others in the database

106
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,079
rare genetics i want to just make are

107
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,719
not no are not necessarily better

108
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
genetics so just keep that in mind all

109
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,840
fall

110
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
in the wide common range a lot of these

111
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,239
are considered to be common not

112
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,959
necessary again

113
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,560
not necessarily a bad thing it just

114
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,479
gives you an idea of how common those

115
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,239
genetics may be

116
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,079
now the variation that occurs how

117
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,759
diverse is a genetic profile

118
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,680
note that the lower the variation the

119
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,479
more likely the plant in a population

120
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
will perform

121
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,238
is similar what this means if you have a

122
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,560
high degree of variation

123
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,920
and you grow a lot of plants you're

124
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,479
going to see a very high

125
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,518
amount of variability from one plant to

126
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,359
the next

127
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,039
the middle two strains offer a more

128
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,959
consistency which can be especially

129
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,919
important in large populations of plants

130
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,200
being grown

131
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,518
in the sense that they're going to be

132
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,359
more uniform you're not going to have

133
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,039
massively tall than short plants for

134
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,239
example you have a little bit more

135
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,839
uniformity across the field there in

136
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,518
general

137
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,439
then we get to genetically distant

138
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,199
varieties so if you're looking for a

139
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,879
different genetic base to cross this

140
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,560
provides some suggestions

141
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,800
for strains that can help increase the

142
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,519
variation in resulting offspring

143
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,040
only cushionings appear in all reports

144
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,159
again it can kind of just give an idea

145
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,759
if you're looking at breeding

146
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,759
or getting into the breeding aspect what

147
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,360
might you breed into it you know here's

148
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,639
some examples here

149
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
now it's important that all of these

150
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,040
that we've been looking at here are all

151
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,319
charlotte's or listed as charlotte's web

152
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
but we can see through all of these

153
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,519
reports

154
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,319
the variability that we get in all of

155
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,079
these

156
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,918
so it's just kind of it's important to

157
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,039
note that there is this variability even

158
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,519
though everything is called

159
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,400
charlotte's web so the reason why i make

160
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,079
note of that

161
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,839
is this quick comparison hopefully shows

162
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,680
the great variability that can exist for

163
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,799
plant material that may all have

164
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,879
the same name so buyer beware

165
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,639
asking for a coa certificate of

166
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,319
authenticity and other supporting

167
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,079
documentation is important to make sure

168
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,519
you know what you're getting

169
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,680
so again to stick with the charlotte's

170
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,918
web theme these are all charlotte's web

171
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,800
this one's the book from 1952 this is

172
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,879
the 1973 film this is the 2006

173
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,919
film all these are charlotte's web but

174
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,639
all these are very

175
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,839
different same thing with the cannabis

176
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,120
strains as well

177
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,560
so make sure you're paying for your

178
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,680
getting or at least you know what you're

179
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,319
getting with some sort

180
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,038
of certificate and documentation and

181
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,199
it's up to you

182
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,319
the buyer purchaser to request this

183
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,720
documentation

184
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,680
that hopefully can be provided by who's

185
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,960
ever supplying it

186
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,639
if you always wanted to check you could

187
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,239
send the sample out yourself and

188
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,000
hopefully it comes back with what the

189
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,120
person who sent it to you the supplier

190
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,519
who sent it to you

191
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,639
said that you're paying for so again

192
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,439
buyer beware

193
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,478
always seek documentation to ensure

194
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,839
you're getting

195
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,839
what you expect
