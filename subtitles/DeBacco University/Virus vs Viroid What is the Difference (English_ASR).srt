00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,658
on this debaco University video I'm

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:06,119
going to go over the difference between

3
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:07,619
a virus and a viroid so you can

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,019
understand the difference in the

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,820
distinctions between these two which are

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,660
typically used as interchangeable terms

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,660
when they shouldn't

8
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:21,259
[Music]

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,019
all right let's go over virus versus

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,580
viroid and what the actual difference is

11
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,159
we can see visually there's a large

12
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,379
difference the virus here and the viroid

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,939
here of the simpler image because it is

14
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,859
a simpler molecule

15
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:36,539
so starting with a virus probably what

16
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,179
you're more familiar with or at least

17
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,460
have heard more of it's basically a

18
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,159
nucleic acid wrapped in a protein coat

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,980
that could be a DNA molecule or an RNA

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:50,819
molecule a virus is an infectious agent

21
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:53,459
consisting of segmented uh this nuclear

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,198
nucleic acid again I said DNA or RNA

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,600
could be single stranded or could also

24
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,119
be double-stranded DNA or RNA kind of a

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,739
unique feature to viruses and that

26
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:05,399
protein coat is the surrounding

27
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:08,219
protective structure for a virus viruses

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,560
cannot replicate by themselves they need

29
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,140
a host cell to infect to change the

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,719
Machinery to get the cell to make more

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,579
virus particles so that host cell that

32
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,459
could be a plant cell that could be an

33
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:23,340
animal cell components of those are

34
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:25,919
needed to assemble and produce new

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,840
viruses now viruses don't have a single

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,599
shape we can see here this uh some

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,460
examples here we could see some have a

38
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,978
very straight shape like tobacco mosaic

39
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,719
virus some very alien-like in some of

40
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,938
the very spherical some can look like a

41
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,060
bullet shaped all different morphologies

42
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,519
now going on to a viroid they are very

43
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,799
simple now when I say simple they're one

44
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,560
of the most simple structures uh we know

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,840
of they're 50 to 80 times smaller than

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,640
the smallest viral genomes right now

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,799
currently virus are the smallest known

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,439
infectious agents that mainly cause

49
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,479
these diseases in plants so not too much

50
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,859
of an animal Factor here they are

51
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,840
free-floating a piece of circular

52
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,420
genetic information and they're very

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,479
very small in size so small they can

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,598
only be seen here with it as an electron

55
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,540
microscope as these images depict

56
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,399
now comparison between our viruses and

57
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,459
our viroids is kind of put a couple key

58
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,099
differences here viruses are small and

59
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,659
simple but virus are smaller and even

60
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:26,579
more simple is a great way to think

61
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,400
about it viruses do have that protein

62
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,860
coat they have nucleic acids infections

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,200
to all organisms plants or animals and

64
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,239
thyroids have no protein coat they are

65
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,238
mainly composed of RNA as far as their

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,400
nucleic acids are concerned and they are

67
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,560
in effect mainly in only plants that we

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,719
know of viruses again a little brighter

69
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,280
broader Host range and a little bit more

70
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,560
complexity even though they're still

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,959
very simple compared to a cell

72
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,598
now also I want to keep in mind this is

73
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,519
a key distinction is that this is the

74
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,979
appropriate time to use the word strain

75
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,560
when referring to viruses the variants

76
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:04,318
the strains we shouldn't be referring to

77
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,840
cannabis as a strain that is really

78
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,759
reserved for the viral

79
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,860
um

80
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,479
taxonomy and way of naming things strain

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,099
really we should be using cultivar or

82
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,560
variety we're talking about plants

83
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:18,560
strains should be preserved to viruses
