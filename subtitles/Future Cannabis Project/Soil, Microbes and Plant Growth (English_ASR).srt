1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:03,258 --> 00:00:12,480
did you guys have any of the money that

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:15,989
the bank is the cannabis that came and

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,750
thank you yeah yeah shit was rampant but

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,660
I mean it ended up not being as big of a

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,469
deal as we're really concerned about it

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:29,609
but it didn't affect more than banker

8
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:31,609
plants are just the barley yeah now

9
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,520
we're looking for would you do

10
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:39,780
insecticidal soap yep to knock him down

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,879
and then at after the the bud set they

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,700
didn't really like infest in there they

13
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:48,359
were like elsewhere they didn't like to

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:53,699
be nesting and gradual iterating in the

15
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:56,250
bunny or grateful thank God but the the

16
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:59,608
green lace wings the they started

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,549
showing up in force and ladybug larva

18
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:06,030
and they were they're voracious you know

19
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:08,879
and I think in the future we won't spray

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,820
insecticidal soap because it it affects

21
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,709
the green lace wings and ladybugs other

22
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,329
bugs the good guys yeah

23
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:18,549
that's cool I'm glad you're aware of

24
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:22,090
that yeah take care most people don't

25
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:24,429
get that part yeah I mean right you kill

26
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,439
the fungi yes you killed all the good

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,140
guys too

28
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,120
oh yeah I know totally totally like

29
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,960
we're transitioning we've been in the

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,689
process of transitioning from fuel beds

31
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:40,059
from smart pots to Hubel beds and

32
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:43,450
wherever there's Hugo beds there's a lot

33
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,600
less pressure for sure and that's that

34
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,040
film on which is that fungal-dominated a

35
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,759
smart pots are not smart I'll tell you

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,140
that right now

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,450
I got a solution to that for reals

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,920
it's called jeolban they make a compost

39
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,710
bin I use it all the time it's super

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,420
great but this year I cut it in half and

41
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:07,539
it makes an 18 inch tall bed and you get

42
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,490
it's a hundred and four gallon pot but

43
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,770
here's the cool part the way it's built

44
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,420
you can leave them together so I played

45
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,840
with I think they're there they're like

46
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:19,149
almost like a dovetail or like a Lego

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,909
stack kind of thing okay I'll show you

48
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,539
this cool it's time not all my I tuned

49
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:25,848
all my beds this

50
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:30,229
and your son's party what are they made

51
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:31,609
out okay so it's like do weird work with

52
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:34,429
weird companies and put it together

53
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,739
because I think they're doing

54
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:40,549
work because of smart pots now I'm

55
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:42,980
really smart yeah we're gonna do for the

56
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:46,549
Hugo bed smoke will mount it up and we

57
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:48,378
have a plethora of fallen logs that just

58
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:50,870
fall in the road right and we'll just

59
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:52,789
make some beds out of those is it and it

60
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,709
makes sense like you've got a larger

61
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:56,509
decomposition zone you betcha we don't

62
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,489
have to bring anything in really it's

63
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:00,858
all the stuff that we need is pretty

64
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,049
available in abundance you know like for

65
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:05,180
the horsetail grows wild everywhere

66
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,669
around the ponds we've been playing with

67
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,000
that like fermenting it and losing is

68
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:15,260
broth yeah yeah the oak saw some really

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,239
good results so yeah and the silica from

70
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:18,918
the horses oh okay you have to heat it

71
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,259
up with honey right to break it down

72
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,049
because it frees up like at a higher pH

73
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:25,340
then like the acidic like the black

74
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:27,769
coating servers that will that make

75
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,709
sense so yeah it's really authorizing

76
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:33,438
mm-hmm so yeah honey is like the there's

77
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:39,009
something about it like user disagree in

78
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:40,959
a certain pH this your brainchild the

79
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,389
Canada's project do that was a pain in

80
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,938
the butt last sound sister the future

81
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:49,328
cannabis project this this is your your

82
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:52,078
brain baby beautiful baby I love it

83
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,079
thank you so much

84
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,670
tell the salary boys

85
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,069
cute what's you've enough to like what

86
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,720
do you spend your energy on this year

87
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:09,349
lately yeah oh man you know trying to

88
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:12,689
get these microbes to grow bro yeah what

89
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:14,280
cultivating and encouraging you know are

90
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:16,980
you working with Katherine definitely

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,370
right all right we're team since oil

92
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,180
okay cool gotcha all right all right I

93
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,340
got a question

94
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,030
as a farmer trying to be more generative

95
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:30,359
we don't want to bring in truck in bulk

96
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:32,489
soil and is there anything like I mean

97
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,750
we would like to amend the net the

98
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,389
native soil and the soil that we've

99
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,040
already trucked in you guys offer

100
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:43,110
something that could help us with that

101
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,670
right you know you can never amend

102
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,009
something until you figure out what it

103
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,230
needs so that's the problem with a lot

104
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,819
of amending or recommendations just

105
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,009
because your neighbor needs you know

106
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,500
more nitrogen or more potassium doesn't

107
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,959
mean you necessarily do so we always we

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,019
offer various types of soil testing for

109
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,569
soil biology as well as soil chemistry

110
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:05,639
interpretation which we're mostly

111
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,110
biologically based we think the microbes

112
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,079
should do the work so you don't have to

113
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,030
so once you can determine what microbes

114
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,918
you have and make sure there aren't any

115
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:15,599
bad ones that are going to get in the

116
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,599
way of the good ones doing their job

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,300
then you can really dial in a system you

118
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,879
know based on what your soil actually

119
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,829
needs using cover crops you know top

120
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,990
dressing and compost you know whatever

121
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:29,430
waste streams you dealt with but you

122
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,430
definitely don't want to just go throw

123
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,250
in everything in the child so can you

124
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,689
give some examples of recent projects of

125
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,069
like what you notice

126
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,959
looked at the soil whether it was

127
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:43,379
microbes or nutrients and then like what

128
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:46,408
your prescription was yeah well a lot of

129
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,299
times we deal with very bacterial

130
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:51,269
dominated soils because people are just

131
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:53,638
overly applying nitrogen you know and

132
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:55,949
and also phosphorus and that doesn't get

133
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,588
broken down so it's just sitting in the

134
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,149
soil so you see as you look at it

135
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:02,939
through a microscope it kind of looks

136
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:05,338
like a bunch of clear crystals just

137
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:07,439
overlapping and I always relate it to

138
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:09,389
like that game Plinko you know where you

139
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,909
drop the thing and it kind of goes down

140
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:14,908
the same like the the price is right but

141
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:16,199
when there's too many particles in the

142
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:18,478
soil too many minerals they're

143
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,429
overlapping the water which would be

144
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,188
that little like token you're dropping

145
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:25,049
down has nowhere to go and so that's

146
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:27,389
like compaction so that's being a

147
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,189
lattice condoms yeah exactly and you

148
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,959
think about how you would want water to

149
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,838
flow through soil you want it to go

150
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,939
laterally and spread out and then down

151
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:39,028
when it just either goes straight down

152
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:41,039
or it just puddles up at the top you

153
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:43,199
know that's not really plant available

154
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,488
in capillary action though so yeah so

155
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,949
when I look at soil through the

156
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:49,738
microscope I like to see a lot of big

157
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:52,169
chunks but with some flow in between

158
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:53,998
them so you know that's airspace and

159
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:55,378
that's where the water and the oxygen is

160
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:58,679
going to be to keep you so that would be

161
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,778
like a texture or like a consistency

162
00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:02,368
that you're looking you're analyzing

163
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:04,978
definitely well and so that's the thing

164
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:07,649
as you use the biology as the organic

165
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:11,639
matter is is you know giving back to

166
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:15,269
that soil structure then the byproduct

167
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,009
of those microorganisms like reproducing

168
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,199
and processing and eating and chelating

169
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,598
all these minerals and and this organic

170
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,338
matter is that they they're gonna change

171
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,128
that structure and they're gonna have

172
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:28,288
the glues the ghulami lens the humic

173
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:30,419
acids the phobics that will then bond

174
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:31,949
those particles together to to make the

175
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:34,459
structure different changes that crumb

176
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:37,499
structure you know gosh and do you guys

177
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:40,319
recommend any cover crops in in

178
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,150
conjunction with your your amendments

179
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,669
and the testing

180
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:45,679
yeah I mean I think you should always be

181
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:47,569
growing cover crops for the season just

182
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,240
not just for the microbes but for your

183
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:52,129
plants to increase terpene profile - you

184
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,220
know ward off and attract beneficial

185
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:57,500
insects you know the only you should

186
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,750
really never have bear exposed soil it's

187
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,228
either subject to the elements in one

188
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:06,500
way or another yeah try and keep our

189
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:08,930
soil charged you know and always alive

190
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,290
with the worms and some type of cover

191
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,970
crop and usually some type of native

192
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:17,150
what do they call it lambs corridor I

193
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:19,400
think and mint and wild stuff just kind

194
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:23,750
of occurs and we actually we used a lot

195
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:26,089
of the local oak that is decomposing or

196
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,069
we've been kind of collecting it and the

197
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:33,139
Melody's been collecting it for a long

198
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:35,569
time - and that as mulch it just makes

199
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:37,250
mushrooms explode out of the beds like I

200
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,750
think they're called inky top mushrooms

201
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:43,129
or something but every day it's like

202
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:45,350
boom oh and those beds produce like the

203
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:48,830
stank comes off of those beds a lot more

204
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,570
than like that smart pot when you're

205
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,389
introducing microbes that are already

206
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,670
acclimated to that environment so it's

207
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:58,069
all like you know I think at every level

208
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:59,750
diversity is key but you still don't

209
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,910
want to go outside of whatever is

210
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,490
available to you like it's in that

211
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:06,409
environment those microbes are already

212
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,299
they love that they love the temperature

213
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:10,639
there that's their home ground it's like

214
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:12,319
the home team advantage a little bit you

215
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,659
know those guys there's no delay they

216
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
immediately start working for you the

217
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:18,860
other thing about cover crops - is

218
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,399
collect using cover crops that share the

219
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,220
same mycorrhizal relation

220
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,980
with cannabis specific cover crops rise

221
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,410
you guys can can guide us towards that

222
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,379
because I know that there's like like

223
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:34,019
native and native pollinating mixes and

224
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:36,090
you played with different clovers but

225
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,799
we're hearing from our neighbors that

226
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,350
some of the clovers are spider mite

227
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,939
prone and like trying to navigate we

228
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:50,850
don't want it we don't want to

229
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:54,630
jeopardize this ice-cream cake number

230
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:57,090
nine it's like it's not the the one that

231
00:09:54,629 --> 00:10:00,570
we answered in the cup it's like the

232
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:03,570
purple Fino but uh I think it looks

233
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,830
pretty cool I think I've rolled up some

234
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:10,920
some Han Solo if you guys want to smoke

235
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,259
so well farm this is raised cannabis

236
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:16,110
raised goods is the brand that it's

237
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:21,600
entered in the competition under we grew

238
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:25,500
it at Humboldt sunrise farms in bed this

239
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,290
was light death in not a Huebel bed but

240
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,389
a raised bed with cover crops with

241
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:33,240
native pollinators and stuff but we

242
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:35,269
didn't have any like big tree branches

243
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,250
and stuff that we buried underneath

244
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:40,860
she's she's been grown for forty years

245
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,049
so she's accumulated a lot of soil and

246
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,320
every year she'll like Rio mend it with

247
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:49,079
some herb goat worm castings so she's

248
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,150
like she empties out the barn and puts

249
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,900
it on this huge wind row and the goats

250
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:57,269
just moved through it and you know after

251
00:10:53,899 --> 00:11:00,659
the rest of the team yeah after a season

252
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:02,579
it has no smell it's just in the rain

253
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:05,250
the rains hopefully washed out a lot of

254
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:08,370
like stuff that we wouldn't want to

255
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,029
accumulate you did not season to your

256
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,889
advantage

257
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:17,578
yeah that winterizing

258
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:20,688
it helps for sure as the crow flies I

259
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:27,149
don't say like between 20 and 30 miles

260
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:30,448
maybe closer we're at 1,700 feet it's

261
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:32,818
about an hour drive to the coast hour 15

262
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:34,708
minutes drive to the 1700 feet

263
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:38,188
whereas that in relationship to that

264
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:40,818
pretty pretty high in that range no I

265
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:43,980
mean it's there's there's a lot of

266
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:47,308
variation one of our properties will be

267
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,548
at 1,100 another at 1,300 this one's 17

268
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:51,899
and there's another one at like 21 or

269
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:54,539
something like that and we do see a

270
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,519
little variation in quality mostly

271
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:58,379
because the temperature is different and

272
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,879
the humidity is different in those areas

273
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,100
then you get some of that coastal

274
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,949
effects though yo yeah you definitely

275
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:08,609
have a maritime climate each morning

276
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:10,168
that fog rolls in and it's it's right in

277
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:13,709
that little pocket where it's not too

278
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:18,028
much fog every morning it kind of burns

279
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:21,388
off around 11 o'clock and rolls back in

280
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:24,379
and it's pretty sweet so every time it

281
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:28,409
rolls in a lot of girls like oh crap

282
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:31,319
here comes the moisture right but think

283
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:33,778
of it as an inoculation sure yeah that

284
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:34,679
out those I'm oh you're getting all that

285
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:37,049
marine

286
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,579
all that stuff that's come up off the

287
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,439
land and been trapped up into that

288
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:45,710
moisture and it's coming onto the land

289
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,710
and in some places that have been abused

290
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,048
[Music]

291
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:58,709
that is one of those first steps that's

292
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,429
one of those first steps of Mother

293
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:04,019
Nature shifting that succession and

294
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:05,879
introducing the bacteria onto the land

295
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,009
which it then progresses and continues

296
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,200
to grow and it gets more complex and

297
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:11,720
more complex so what you're doing is

298
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,100
you're just speeding up the process

299
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,440
that's gonna work with the natural

300
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,629
systems as much as possible

301
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,330
you know adaptively man job forest with

302
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:24,208
the goats a little bit and it's really

303
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,730
really helps with fire prevention like

304
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:29,549
all of our neighborhood went up in smoke

305
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:33,028
it was really sad actually and melody

306
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:35,659
she has she's got water for the

307
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:38,700
neighborhood in case there is a fire and

308
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:41,219
so and so much brush cleanup you can do

309
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,360
I mean if everybody had goats there

310
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,089
would be a there'd be a lot less

311
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,039
wildfires going on a really cool

312
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,720
benefits of goats which is something

313
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,939
that in the soil profile that we're

314
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,730
always looking for are what are called

315
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,440
micro arthropods which is another way

316
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,960
Safety's teeny tiny crabs okay

317
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,930
and their job is to shred up that

318
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,509
material like a hypo aspis my hypo a

319
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:06,409
smiles you want to know it's really like

320
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,159
when you're looking through the

321
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:09,079
microscope

322
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,610
it's like Godzilla walking through Tokyo

323
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,000
that's what it looks like

324
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:20,169
it is spring to grab no no like straight

325
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,169
up king crab with long spindly arms and

326
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:35,230
and so it's just best friends mal to my

327
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:37,909
course its jaw though right yeah it's

328
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,320
well there's macro arthropods which are

329
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:41,179
what you're referring to that you can

330
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,730
see with your naked eye or with like a

331
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:46,969
very mild objective and then there's

332
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:49,100
micro arthropods that you can see we had

333
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,529
about a hundred to 200 X but to really

334
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,230
like see them you're you're going to

335
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:55,610
like 400 and they do is like I don't

336
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,110
have you ever worked on the microscope

337
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,450
when you see a nematode you know how

338
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,250
like you can see everything moving

339
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,310
around where the nematode like you think

340
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,139
about the t-rex going boom boom it's the

341
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:09,979
same thing with the micro arthropod it

342
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:13,549
just pulls everything so just imagine

343
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,350
like a wrecking ball coming that's

344
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:18,259
happening in your soil or it's supposed

345
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,700
to and that's creating air pockets and

346
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:22,370
what you were talking about cue with

347
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:25,400
aggregates that crumble like when you

348
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:27,500
haven't abuse or soil you go out there

349
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,019
you should be able to do that and it'd

350
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,100
be like cottage cheese you know where

351
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:35,100
the curds and stuff like it should be

352
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,500
I've literally I've literally worked in

353
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,909
a heavy heavy clay so that you could hit

354
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,458
it with a dig bar and you're only going

355
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:45,000
in yeah concrete your son yeah and

356
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:46,859
literally from like a cover cropping and

357
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,839
topdressing and name like sheet mulching

358
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,300
it and like stoking it out and teeing it

359
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,740
up taking care of that soil the next

360
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,318
year you could literally go and like

361
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,730
break into it and and and it was crazy

362
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:58,828
because like the clay would literally

363
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:04,289
just break up and like crumble up the

364
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:07,109
color change like that and it doesn't

365
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:08,818
have to take 20 years ten thousand years

366
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:13,649
mother nature's scheduled one season

367
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:17,068
yeah you can go from dirt to reaching

368
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:20,328
your arm into three feet of alive it's

369
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:22,799
crazy and it's because you add the life

370
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:24,899
where you guys recommend that the life

371
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,578
come from like you're like good shits

372
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,318
you know we've been doing some wood chip

373
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:30,208
in and caught in trying to compost that

374
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:34,198
stuff down with the width of the goat

375
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:36,419
manure but like the hey I guess is good

376
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,568
and cover crop making our own residues

377
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:44,009
and stuff but like to really get like to

378
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:45,568
get three feet of 4,000 square feet you

379
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:48,600
know that's like that's a lot of that's

380
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:50,909
a lot of material this is where yeah

381
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,409
wonderful companies who understand this

382
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:57,179
reality go we have that so you can show

383
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:59,039
you yeah we could either show you and

384
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,599
teach you where we can show you a

385
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,309
product that can do it for you it

386
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,720
depends like you know what you put into

387
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:05,548
is what you get out of it you know I

388
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,288
think they think of it as a wheel with

389
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:08,400
all the spokes in it if you don't have

390
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:10,288
one of those spokes

391
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,880
functional the wheels not going to go

392
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:14,129
down the road so you have to kind of

393
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,900
look you know what are my waste streams

394
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,400
what can I do to lies that's available

395
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,400
to me thank you

396
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,369
yeah true like the the PGD companies

397
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,360
they'll do clearing and they'll chip in

398
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:32,269
they'll just leave it Wow look you

399
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:35,750
really want to charge it like go maybe

400
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:38,359
go crazy you add the life soak this so

401
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:42,799
then you get an extract or a compost tea

402
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:44,869
or a gravy to go to those piles that

403
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,299
you're just gonna let it sit for a year

404
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:49,309
it doesn't have to be on your property

405
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,879
but you can put those microbes to work

406
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:54,559
changing that biology and then take that

407
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,630
as long as you set it up correctly it

408
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,549
gets stronger over time like though the

409
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,650
longer it sits the better it gets that's

410
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:03,289
like so anybody tells you you're gonna

411
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,269
see this decline or you know that's not

412
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:06,049
correct you're just not doing the steps

413
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:09,230
in the right order

414
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:11,930
biology concentrates life like it takes

415
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:15,680
the forces and it concentrates it into

416
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:18,110
like a denser form right and and really

417
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,120
that's where that amino acid complex is

418
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:23,179
coming from from the diversity of life

419
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:25,189
and eating and processing that matter in

420
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,340
that mineral and then it puts it into

421
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:31,039
the amino acid which is like the body

422
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:33,439
force right and then from there we

423
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,509
laughing the plant that's complex eating

424
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,580
and that's flavor complexity and that's

425
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:38,960
like you know all the turqu complexity

426
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:43,149
that's that's that's where that comes

427
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,150
from working with the exodus of the plan

428
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:48,960
you want the hands yeah you're putting

429
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,960
the planet

430
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,759
oh you're like I want to eat this I want

431
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,130
to eat broken shoes because it has the

432
00:18:53,759 --> 00:19:00,019
intelligence yeah but it's not just

433
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:03,480
juice the plant could help this yeah

434
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:06,990
signal hey I know it's not out here on

435
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,160
the buffet line with 50 options but

436
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,609
could you really make me some of

437
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,460
grandmas pie and it will encourage that

438
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:18,229
growth and then be able to access it

439
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:22,019
see it's in UC Davis right now is saying

440
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:25,950
minimum of 15 cover crop species remain

441
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:27,389
in them of like 23 five or something

442
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,529
it's like if you want to talk about

443
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,420
diversity and sugar

444
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:32,549
you know distribution and because

445
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,840
there's gonna be different microbes for

446
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:36,180
different plants you know I'm saying

447
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,970
like like different preferences of food

448
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,610
types for different folks so the easiest

449
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,850
way to start is gaining that knowledge

450
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:47,399
of your place and what resources you

451
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:50,250
have but also the life that lives there

452
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:56,250
it's part of the team and Jeff Jeff's

453
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:57,660
got an amazing but if you talk to Jeff I

454
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,880
mean it is part of the teaming with

455
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,519
microbes teams nutrients who the fungi

456
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:07,740
needs to be the other meaning of the

457
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:10,799
word - it requires a active diverse team

458
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,640
robust some somebody needs to initiate

459
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,639
the symbiosis

460
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,829
but over the last sixty to eighty years

461
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:28,070
we've killed everything oh it's sad the

462
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:29,929
situation is bleak I mean dismal and a

463
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:32,869
lot of like how we get our food is

464
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:35,660
pretty messed up taking the idea of what

465
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:38,000
plants grow in and turned it from soil

466
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,279
which when I spell that out of my phone

467
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,259
it auto corrects the soul like the soul

468
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,960
of the plant right that's where terroir

469
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:46,490
is right when Frenchy and Elaine were

470
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,220
targets like yeah that's where it's at

471
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,440
starts with the microbes you take that

472
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:55,308
and it translates through the plant and

473
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,269
it it changes to idealize itself in that

474
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:59,599
growing environment

475
00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:04,940
it's like magic man it is but you can

476
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:07,129
see there is a guy doing some work you

477
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:10,039
know with can it with CBD growing the

478
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,400
same you know CBD cultivar for like 20

479
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:13,190
years

480
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,920
switch to more fungal dominated soil all

481
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,920
of a sudden the plant started showing a

482
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,690
complete diverse cannabinoid profile you

483
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,300
know and it's having all of those

484
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,910
enzymes all those amino acids available

485
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:28,220
so where those little complexities or

486
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,950
nuances can you know actually be

487
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:34,100
produced it's not limited that's hidden

488
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,808
it switches that's him the T GHC that's

489
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:37,699
those genomes switches that are getting

490
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:41,178
hit by the enzyme getting hit by the

491
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,519
amino you know genetics turn it on yeah

492
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:46,250
basically triggered by different

493
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:49,129
conditions to produce

494
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:51,619
our own gut biome microbiome inside of

495
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,600
our bodies and if you eat crappy food it

496
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:55,519
makes you feel like this you know where

497
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,669
it gives you you know some on the back

498
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:01,069
side or something yes and that's because

499
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:04,940
you don't have what it takes literally

500
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:07,220
to process that material your plants

501
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:12,769
don't have what it takes to do what they

502
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:14,630
want to do what they need and if you

503
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:17,240
think about it the root hair of a plant

504
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:25,310
is so fine it's sucking in the mineral

505
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:28,609
right sucking in that and but but so the

506
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:30,799
focal on the on the root tip right it's

507
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:33,109
sucking in molecules like super small

508
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,779
right of that nutrient mineral micro

509
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:37,219
micro yeah and but it's not digesting it

510
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:39,339
doesn't have a stomach like an animal

511
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,500
right animal has a stomach it can

512
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:44,240
micronized it and if it's the

513
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,759
microscopic animals then they can digest

514
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,799
that food and then when it comes out and

515
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,509
it hits the root here it's going in

516
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,419
right because it's that it's small

517
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:54,980
enough to like make the trek yeah that

518
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,970
makes sense that I mean that makes sense

519
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:01,180
I see like yeah we're kind of on a

520
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,579
debate transitioning from these like

521
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,470
salts and minerals and organic salt

522
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:10,759
mineral things where you need to use a

523
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:12,019
lot of water and if you require like

524
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,329
because we have all of that here in

525
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:16,309
California yeah right and with like

526
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:18,379
these are you guys implementing water

527
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,480
savings you're like strategy that's part

528
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,640
of the whole system right yeah we have

529
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,349
quite a few and a lot of it like I said

530
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,120
it depends on what works was your

531
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:28,699
operation and process you know you

532
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:31,159
utilize biochar in a lot of different

533
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,110
ways which you know the the char that we

534
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,560
work with can hold it even up to Lake I

535
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:37,639
think 13 gallons of water per cubic foot

536
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:41,720
for cubically that's seven and a half

537
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,860
guess is too much where it's like you

538
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,380
have to use like a jar

539
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:49,349
five to ten percent five to ten percent

540
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:53,010
biochar listen very carefully it has to

541
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:56,939
be inoculated the biochar is a structure

542
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:59,579
it's the carbon sponge if it's not

543
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,380
inoculated with the lamppost it's a

544
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:03,629
sponge that will suck nutrients and

545
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,790
stuff out of your soil that's why you'll

546
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,920
often have a lot of people who use a

547
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:11,428
bunch of raw wood chips and they'll have

548
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,840
a big nitrogen sink yeah initially sorry

549
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:14,610
yeah your plants aren't growing quite

550
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,319
right yeah because what they need is

551
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:18,178
being sucked up they gotta get soaked

552
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:25,079
with all that water and the color starts

553
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:28,140
to go change and those are humans that's

554
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:30,470
actually because of the fungi breaking

555
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,690
that down and breaking up the lignin and

556
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:36,480
turning it into the most beautiful

557
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,950
complex organic molecule that's

558
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,410
literally just made by these little

559
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:44,240
creatures exuding different things and

560
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,240
gluing different things together it's

561
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:49,309
why did you say if you think about it

562
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:52,500
right on the simplest level like a

563
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:55,558
simple salt is it going to give you a

564
00:24:52,500 --> 00:25:06,900
complex flavor right I see it in the

565
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:09,029
finished product no now the join doesn't

566
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,610
last long the bugging Bowl would last

567
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:16,829
long it's clean and all the charred shit

568
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:19,439
out of Matt what do you got what is the

569
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:21,779
all right so the microbes are breaking

570
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,450
down the lignin and making these humic

571
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:26,490
acids but like what are the worms due to

572
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:30,808
that like they're making a plant

573
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:32,519
available nutrients they do so so if

574
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:38,210
you've gone from micro to worm you've

575
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:41,569
like giant jumps in Hui to

576
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,249
the worm is like the the great white

577
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:47,298
shark swimming through the soil in

578
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:49,368
comparison to that but what it's doing

579
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:56,019
is the worms don't eat the mineral

580
00:25:49,368 --> 00:25:56,019
they're eating the bacteria on the right

581
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:06,980
where'd your pot down for a day and

582
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:08,808
there's a worm underneath and if there

583
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:17,269
isn't there should be right because that

584
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:20,329
means that you're great they've got some

585
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:22,700
visuals of Lake at the bottom of the

586
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:25,638
pool looking up from the perspective of

587
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,200
below the roots without seeing the soil

588
00:26:25,638 --> 00:26:29,359
and just seeing all the life moving

589
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,538
through it it's gorgeous but that's what

590
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,859
we think we get we get locked off

591
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:37,700
because we can't see what's moving

592
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:39,888
around everywhere or should be and it's

593
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:43,970
there all right I've noticed I can feel

594
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:46,519
it when I when you are monitoring the

595
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,169
moisture level and the soil every day

596
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,599
and it's like pretty much your main

597
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:52,700
focus and you're watching how much

598
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:55,128
moisture is in the Solvers how much has

599
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,619
transpired through the plant

600
00:26:55,128 --> 00:27:02,599
how much is evaporated because of you

601
00:26:57,618 --> 00:27:04,730
know humidity and the wind and heat you

602
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,949
see when the roots fill out like you get

603
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:09,079
x-ray vision down there and then it's

604
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,730
like okay I'm starting to develop this

605
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:14,868
relationship with the soil where it's I

606
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:16,819
can't really put words on it have all

607
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:18,528
those nutrients present otherwise you

608
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:19,908
just get those tap roots you want those

609
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:22,278
little feeder roots you want those

610
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:23,720
lateral growth those little feeders that

611
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:26,990
are like your foot soldiers out there

612
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,028
reaching for food all of the time but

613
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,909
just to touch on the worms another cool

614
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:34,878
thing about worms so there's only two

615
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:37,009
ways to like sterilize organic matter

616
00:27:34,878 --> 00:27:39,469
it's there's thermal composting at

617
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:41,509
reaching up temperatures between 130 and

618
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,089
160 for a certain amount of time

619
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:48,440
and then passing through the digestive

620
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:51,769
system of a worm it does it only two

621
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:57,740
ways and that little worm does just

622
00:27:51,769 --> 00:28:00,109
shovel it and turn it we win the concern

623
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:04,849
about not thermophilic li composting

624
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:06,740
this goat manure you know process and

625
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,839
you you want it there's some things you

626
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:12,230
want to like test to see with it but

627
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:14,539
like also it's like aging is also that

628
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,640
time where the goat manure it does get a

629
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:18,259
little bit hotter but manure it depends

630
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:24,320
what they're eating on the spectrum of

631
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:26,240
manures it's not like it says it depends

632
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,129
if it's miss mixed with urine and then

633
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:38,210
it definitely will be a little spicier

634
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:39,500
yeah but the worms will chew it up the

635
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,509
thing with the worms you got to watch

636
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,549
you need it to be moist so you have to

637
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:46,039
watch that moisture level a little bit

638
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:48,079
more with compost it's more like a 70

639
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:51,139
percent moisture opposed to like the 50

640
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:55,279
percent already the microbes need water

641
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:57,740
so they can drown which we all know when

642
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,740
you overwater but if you let your putz

643
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,599
dry out they literally shrivel up and

644
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,220
are like hey it's not okay the little go

645
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:06,109
dormant for a little while and it'll

646
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,450
take them a minutes of reactivating a

647
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:10,849
static get re-established but what has

648
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,980
happened to your plants at during that

649
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:17,299
time period oh yeah literally your

650
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:20,420
entire team went we're out right no what

651
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:23,599
about their bodies literally frivolous

652
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,340
their bodies are 70 percent water and it

653
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,349
when you're watering your soil really

654
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:30,599
what you're doing is you're rehydrating

655
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:33,329
the life that's there and you want to

656
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:36,000
have you have you played with stress

657
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:38,549
factors in the plant having a beneficial

658
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,890
you know having any benefit in the

659
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:43,589
terpene profile on the finished product

660
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:45,900
cuz I see like it's important for the

661
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:50,369
plant to experience that and when you

662
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:52,080
choose to you know put the plant I can

663
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:54,419
break that down too because there's

664
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,240
microbes that are keyed into the plant

665
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:59,150
that when the plant is sending out

666
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,279
stress signals they start producing

667
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:05,490
polysaccharides sugars to feed the plant

668
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:08,250
and that's where you see that from a lot

669
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:10,289
of times there's one type we use in our

670
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:13,500
grow cubes a type of bacterium called an

671
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:15,569
Indo fight it's a type there's an actual

672
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,910
there's a couple hundred different

673
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:19,529
species of them but they colonize within

674
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:22,440
the plant tissue and that's literally

675
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:24,329
it's only job is to make sure that plant

676
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,960
has food because that's how it stays

677
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:30,240
alive so when that plant is like ah it's

678
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,980
this is like okay sugar sugar sugar

679
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,380
sugar whatever you need don't I don't

680
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,200
hey leave me hangin buddy you know and

681
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:39,030
that's I think why our system a lot you

682
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,150
know sometimes but it's like that level

683
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:45,119
of stress and how fast like the microbes

684
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,040
can survive if that stress level or like

685
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:50,069
climate change or environment change is

686
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,649
gradual but if it's like boom within an

687
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:54,569
hour or two it kills everything so

688
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:56,190
that's where like you why you see mixed

689
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:57,809
results I would imagine with like

690
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:00,059
stressing the plants because I've seen

691
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:02,879
it go both ways alright I did a test

692
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,720
went on some CBD Ringo's gift right and

693
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,820
I didn't water

694
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,000
I stopped watering it in the in a Huebel

695
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:10,740
bed granted I stopped watering it in

696
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,450
August I didn't water at all September

697
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,069
and I chopped it off over it in water at

698
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:17,480
one time it rained a couple of times but

699
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:19,710
it was delicious the flavor and the

700
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,630
resin heads and I looked at him under

701
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,558
the scope they were so full and robust

702
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,450
compared to everything else it was

703
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:27,788
saying like when you're stressed out

704
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:31,179
doesn't your saket smell differently the

705
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:35,109
same thing let's take it everybody get

706
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:39,990
stressed your plan but where it grew was

707
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:42,428
in this giant fungal community of right

708
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,548
right within that time fungal community

709
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:49,629
that giant fungal community actually

710
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:53,079
will share water so it was tapped into

711
00:31:49,628 --> 00:31:55,408
that whole bed but because it was tapped

712
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:58,298
into it it had to depend on his friends

713
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:59,980
and he's like hey buddies I hate some

714
00:31:58,298 --> 00:32:01,538
help here this guy's not watering me

715
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,599
anymore and I got some things to do and

716
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:09,538
so they gave to it and it changed his

717
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:15,398
profile I was playing with the bacillus

718
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:22,269
mega terraeum bacillus lactobacillus

719
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:25,359
bacterias but I noticed like when I put

720
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:27,878
the bacillus on there the stem the the

721
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:31,569
diameter of the stem double standing

722
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:34,538
here you know and it seems to help with

723
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:36,189
drought type situations mm-hmm it's that

724
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:39,009
same thing where it's like colonies

725
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,720
colonized is so close to that root zone

726
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:42,579
that you're putting it's like the

727
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,618
gatekeeper for the root and if you're

728
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:46,569
putting that bacillus in and that's

729
00:32:44,618 --> 00:32:48,970
where it likes to live is really

730
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:51,099
could you take like my brother and his

731
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,798
wife have a yogurt company so one of the

732
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:57,658
byproducts is play and they make a way

733
00:32:53,798 --> 00:33:00,398
for a biotic drink but you can basically

734
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:04,870
read those you could like make it tea

735
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:07,569
and like keep mother mother it or make

736
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:08,888
similar to like kombucha scoby or so or

737
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,798
you know it's a little bit different

738
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:14,918
process and kombucha cuz with kombucha

739
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:16,808
you dealing with yeast more down the

740
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:18,909
path of how do they knock you late labs

741
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:21,038
like how to make some labs or how do you

742
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:23,440
guys do it yeah I mean there's a lot of

743
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,450
different ways to do it you get like I

744
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,610
like to do use a variety of different

745
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:31,210
seed washes you know everybody says rice

746
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:33,369
but like I also was using for a while

747
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:35,230
when I was making bubble hash the best

748
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:37,869
labs I ever made I would use the

749
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:40,808
recycled bubble hash water I have

750
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:42,878
pictures of it on my Instagram and it it

751
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:45,069
would come out you know the curd would

752
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:46,719
come out like almost iridescent yeah I'm

753
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:48,519
changing the water for that and

754
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,639
different grains would have different

755
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:53,589
patterns like the barley was like really

756
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:55,959
look like brain my mind that's it that

757
00:33:53,589 --> 00:34:02,589
looks great I can show you I have to dig

758
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:05,409
up a picture but barley barley seed I

759
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:07,418
really like blue corn seed wash like I'm

760
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:11,490
a big fan of like the sprouted ct's or

761
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:14,889
enzyme teas so like hold up genius

762
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:17,199
that's that's it works but the hash

763
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:19,450
water cuz it's like they got all those

764
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,489
polyphenols in there okay and that's

765
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:23,588
with those like those tough-guy

766
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:25,118
bacterias really like to chew on or

767
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:27,818
there's like kind of like so we're

768
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,818
adding compounds that break down slower

769
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:32,829
it's same white people say not to use

770
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:34,269
eucalyptus and compost it's not that it

771
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:36,550
doesn't break down it just takes longer

772
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:38,168
because of all those polyphenols an

773
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:41,019
aromatic hamhock compound

774
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:42,578
sir pepper they're very bullish on also

775
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,449
don't know if it's other fumbler or

776
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:46,119
other growth

777
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:48,460
what about brassicas someone was telling

778
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:52,119
me that the brassicas are hurting Mike

779
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:56,829
Mike they don't call him a crisis fungi

780
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:59,400
they pretty put out an acid your cold

781
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:03,970
family kind of cozy in that entire group

782
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:07,950
is delicious so that's your cauliflower

783
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:07,949
and you things things like that

784
00:35:10,219 --> 00:35:15,559
so it's not good as a companion prop if

785
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:18,679
you're trying to promote specifically

786
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:22,719
mycorrhizae growth and support that but

787
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:25,368
it doesn't inhibit it's not allopathic

788
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:28,309
has a part to play prefers a different

789
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:31,068
soil biome like it's kind of a simple

790
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:32,960
very simple kind of basic or the same

791
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:35,239
and a little bit of bacteria

792
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,559
do you know it's ours are like grew with

793
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:39,108
dinosaurs they're like some of the

794
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,029
vertical dance that wasn't once

795
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:43,880
something very similar to Legos really

796
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:47,690
nice and I'm gonna do they don't need

797
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,940
that rich environments why you see them

798
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,639
pop up as weeds I'm gonna show you and

799
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,960
you don't have that biology on there

800
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:56,000
when you have a lot of fungi they will

801
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,539
pop up because they can grow and that

802
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,010
you know don't pit on cross my fingers

803
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:03,679
let's rewind that and listen to them one

804
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:05,300
at a time is he gonna hurt Mike Anders

805
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,009
they're like grew with dinosaurs they're

806
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,869
like some of the first plants that grew

807
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,440
on land so they have wants something

808
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,210
very similar to like rock or sand you

809
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,338
know they don't need that mineral rich

810
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,280
environment so that's when you why you

811
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:22,009
see them pop up as weeds to and you

812
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,780
don't have that biology there when you

813
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,250
have a lot of fungi they won't pop up

814
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:29,269
because they can't grow in that

815
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:33,250
environment and Ryan what are your

816
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:36,079
thoughts is he gonna hurt my cannabis no

817
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:38,599
this is a cool place it has a different

818
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,130
survival spread rash because they're

819
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:42,019
like I'm doing my thing

820
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,420
I'm gonna do my little it's gonna look

821
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:46,969
the roots what different I can see this

822
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,909
plane is a different agenda I'm gonna

823
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:53,838
throw a ton of seeds because I'm a wee

824
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:55,699
that's all you must know and then you

825
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:58,489
know dump it on cross my fingers

826
00:36:55,699 --> 00:37:00,618
I like brassicas but my buddy Steve was

827
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:03,019
like you know brassicas they're bad for

828
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:04,880
your micro for your micro Rises and I

829
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:06,619
was like I can't go brasses I've been

830
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:13,430
grown brazos with the weed all the time

831
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:15,890
Brassica shit man I actually use them in

832
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:18,769
my garden as banker plants for pests

833
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:21,670
I'll notice that if I do ever get any a

834
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:24,980
fit or whatever it'll hit a Brassica

835
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:27,470
long because think about it the biology

836
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:30,289
in the soil is more complex complex

837
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:31,608
therefore the the guys who kind of just

838
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,329
doing their own thing don't have the

839
00:37:31,608 --> 00:37:37,429
team to support them right when that

840
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:39,769
Brassica is all by himself it doesn't

841
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:43,129
have the team support he's more

842
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:44,719
vulnerable therefore those are the ones

843
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,599
that the plants are the insects are

844
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:50,000
going to go after not the strong from

845
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,130
the nutrient content - like aphids like

846
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,010
go after whatever has no sugar in it

847
00:37:52,130 --> 00:38:00,730
like that's what a lot of times I've

848
00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:03,020
seen where you're able to not brace so

849
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:05,869
you know that most people don't even

850
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:09,048
know about Brix testing so the higher

851
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:13,670
the Brix rating it's not based on sugar

852
00:38:09,048 --> 00:38:15,798
they use sugar to to calibrate it right

853
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:18,889
it's based on viscosity like how much

854
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:20,538
stuff is in it right and so we know that

855
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:23,509
there's a lot more than just sugar in

856
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:26,210
SAP so that's but that's the missing

857
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:29,300
so if the bricks rating is high enough

858
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:31,309
like even to the 10 to 12 which is

859
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,080
possible that really just means

860
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:37,279
everybody's working together that plant

861
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:40,460
screws their cell wall is thicker and a

862
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,830
athan cannot pierce it like the plant

863
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,559
literally is like you can't bother me go

864
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:47,299
mess with that broccoli no go over there

865
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:51,108
leave cannabis alone you know that's

866
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:54,320
really what's happening I'm a big

867
00:38:51,108 --> 00:38:57,019
believer in the chitin kinase process

868
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,600
you know and how that activates within

869
00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:01,759
of the cells and you know it starts to

870
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,099
produce its own chitin ace and deter

871
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,230
pests and stuff I've been seeing I

872
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:08,599
learned it from this guy John Park and

873
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:10,789
he's a farm called beard asur had a farm

874
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:12,349
called Venus and the corporate stalkers

875
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:14,809
he fucked screwed they fucked him over

876
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:17,719
big-time but he developed the world's

877
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:19,369
largest aquaponics certified organic

878
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,949
aquaponic system down there in

879
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:27,650
Watsonville and the man is just yeah

880
00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:29,239
dude legend legend he was open sourcing

881
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:32,030
everything just teaching people how to

882
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:34,519
feed themselves and stuff but they're

883
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:37,040
using this high chitin worm casting

884
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:38,179
extract to reverse pine beetle

885
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:46,940
infestation

886
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:50,449
like montana and stuff yeah well it's

887
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:52,369
like that PFR 97 there's like maroon bio

888
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:54,949
makes a couple of the same it's like the

889
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:56,329
insect eating fungi you know they feed

890
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:58,129
off of chitin that's why they eat

891
00:39:56,329 --> 00:40:00,369
insects because they're high their

892
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:03,860
exoskeleton skeletons are full

893
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:06,589
like a heavy crazy fact about some heavy

894
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:08,780
control like that's those chitin chitin

895
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:11,390
kinase based solutions seem to be like

896
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:14,390
pretty ecological you know like but

897
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:17,659
you're you hi like a support life not

898
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:19,190
what do I have to kill right you're

899
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:21,289
progressing the plant you're progressing

900
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:24,559
the biology you're making a more diverse

901
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:27,409
more complex and with that the plant

902
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:30,829
becomes more diverse and more complex

903
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:33,469
and I don't know anybody trying to say

904
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:36,049
can I just be more middle of the road no

905
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:37,299
flavor no nothing no we're trying to

906
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:39,410
push it it's trying to push

907
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,269
differentiate the genetic potential

908
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:44,690
which is where we're talking about

909
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:47,659
Tarawa and populations and this is very

910
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:50,750
awesome that the microbes of more place

911
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:53,599
change your plants which makes them yet

912
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:56,590
how can we get more chitin in our system

913
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,589
you know

914
00:40:56,909 --> 00:41:00,779
well you guys recommends different

915
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,400
options right there's always you can

916
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,130
always go buy some which is somebody

917
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,809
else collecting it or you can go and

918
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,369
collect from different sources and this

919
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:11,789
is where understanding the resource

920
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:13,799
opportunities and waste streams just

921
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:15,480
talking about resource right resource on

922
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,250
your farm right your soil and your

923
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,920
fertility like that should be the

924
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:22,050
biggest resource because like that

925
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,030
complex that is the soil right that

926
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,980
structure is what's gonna grow your

927
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:27,960
plant right and other than that it's

928
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,670
temperature and light right but that

929
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,710
structure is like all that minerals so

930
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,480
really like on that budget and on that

931
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,550
plan that fertility planning that soil

932
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,650
plan that management playing like that's

933
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:44,039
gonna like you know I mean that's your

934
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:46,920
men should be on the books like as this

935
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:50,969
is important to like investing be court

936
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:53,970
with there are creatures your flavor a

937
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:55,559
whole ecosystem you have an opportunity

938
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:58,109
to interact with it as someone who's

939
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:00,779
like hey I know that I want to promote

940
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:04,920
this and because that I'm gonna feed

941
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:08,040
this material either a fish amino acid

942
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,610
or the robust structure of you know the

943
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:14,039
compost because the compost is that

944
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:17,070
bacteria fungi protozoa and nematodes

945
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:19,320
all these creatures breaking down

946
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:21,600
organic material and making it plant

947
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,640
available like that's literally what

948
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,009
they do the end result of really good

949
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:31,409
compost if you just let it sit it's

950
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:33,450
called topsoil that's what that soya by

951
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:35,309
zation and Micronesian of organic matter

952
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:37,379
and that's where like you know you

953
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:39,750
talked a lot about this they go back and

954
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,000
forth you know cuz it's like it's you

955
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,800
know it's not so much how you get there

956
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,960
it's just the fact that you're you know

957
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,990
are able to create this closed-loop

958
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,510
system using your own your resources

959
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:53,759
that you have on hand you know and what

960
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:56,850
works with your flow if it's gonna cost

961
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,520
you more time or labor energy to do it

962
00:42:56,849 --> 00:43:01,309
then it's not really that probably you

963
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,039
know gonna work for the

964
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:07,789
got a pencil yeah yeah well and that's

965
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:09,469
that's a good way to describe it it's no

966
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:12,139
production I don't want it to look like

967
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:14,629
a bunch of plastic jugs filled with the

968
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:16,879
liquid nutrients you know if we need

969
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:18,470
some some plant-available nutrition i

970
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,079
would like to be able to make it on site

971
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:24,919
somehow you know you claim so like

972
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:26,929
because the the the compost is it's the

973
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,200
key it's a twofer terroir like you're

974
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:32,269
saying but sometimes you are in a cold

975
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:33,710
spell you know and you need like you

976
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:35,869
need something right now and that

977
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:38,300
compost you know it's gonna have that

978
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:40,759
nutrition short and long term but thing

979
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,590
right now like what do you like it's

980
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,720
gone it's gone through an undesirable

981
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:47,180
stress factor it's just being cool the

982
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:49,250
Sun hasn't come out you know there's no

983
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:51,949
like there's some serious inactivity

984
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:53,900
there's there's no calcium moving but

985
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:55,549
it's really a mobile because the physics

986
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,740
aren't there you know and the compost

987
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,840
can be great you know but when there's

988
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:02,029
calcium and mobility because the physics

989
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,860
aren't there I'd only know that we need

990
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:05,810
to put some calcium chloride on there

991
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:09,079
and do it for it that's where you come

992
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:11,869
with the enzyme this is where you're

993
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,409
right that's a short term but the short

994
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:16,730
term will often inhibit the long term

995
00:44:14,409 --> 00:44:18,799
you say in spraying some calcium

996
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:21,650
chloride and do it with like some sticky

997
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,880
conditions will it inhibit here's an

998
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:28,639
example if you're growing on old farm or

999
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:32,030
or old work land there's so much

1000
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:34,659
phosphorus dumps on to work land and it

1001
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,660
doesn't leave

1002
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:40,800
that phosphorus is hit inhibiting

1003
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:43,109
mycorrhizae growth because they don't

1004
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,039
need the the plant doesn't need it it's

1005
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,650
everywhere

1006
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:51,150
why support this other guy I don't need

1007
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:52,410
the middleman so that that understand

1008
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,980
what's going on in your soil

1009
00:44:52,409 --> 00:44:58,199
what changes that is the biology and so

1010
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:01,230
now what are we adding I don't want to

1011
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:07,529
add comic I want to add the things that

1012
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:10,619
make it available who's doing the work

1013
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:14,100
and if there's an abundance from like an

1014
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:16,409
over input of phosphorus then we want to

1015
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,329
use some fixing plants like some some

1016
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:20,759
cover crops to fix it and try to

1017
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:22,799
remediate the okay so now we're talking

1018
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,530
because you're using life to promote

1019
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,950
life so now I'm gonna have a plant that

1020
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:32,610
has a job so I don't have to and that

1021
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:35,939
job is can be anything like if a

1022
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:37,769
dandelion fixes calcium in the soil that

1023
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,289
we just turned into a part of the team

1024
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:43,980
you see what I mean I like like the idea

1025
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:47,789
of you know making the dandelion plant

1026
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:50,400
extract a liquid plant extract does so

1027
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:52,199
what it is speeding it up a bit and

1028
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,650
you're putting that into the process too

1029
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:58,409
and that's where the enzyme barley like

1030
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:59,970
that if you want to like get you know

1031
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:01,949
you talking about calcium uptake you

1032
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:03,779
want to get your buds swell on a little

1033
00:46:01,949 --> 00:46:05,759
bit and like did you everything

1034
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,790
everything that's in the soil get them

1035
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,800
to kind of take up you know the barley

1036
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:12,840
it's full of AMA lace it's actually the

1037
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,720
enzyme that's in our saliva that breaks

1038
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:18,390
down things it's got a ton of other

1039
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:21,539
enzymes and more complex sugars in it

1040
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:23,549
you can either do like a barley sprouted

1041
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:25,949
CT or if you're trying to do like a

1042
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:28,860
large-scale you can just get the malted

1043
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:30,179
milled barley put in a teabag seep it

1044
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,910
for let aerate it for like 30 minutes

1045
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:35,359
and within a day or two like there's

1046
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:37,069
different ones they also are full and

1047
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,470
with hormones so far Leesville and

1048
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:41,510
auxins that's going to be your like a

1049
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:45,319
pickable like vertical growth and then

1050
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:47,930
like I use blue-corn more in bloom and

1051
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,820
that's lateral growth and like bud

1052
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:52,309
strength and branch strength but I

1053
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:55,070
that's like the two like feeds where

1054
00:46:52,309 --> 00:47:01,849
within 12 to 24 hours like you're just

1055
00:46:55,070 --> 00:47:03,890
like okay you see that she's come out

1056
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:06,139
like you know like I have to see that

1057
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:08,929
shiny planet if it's not shiny it's not

1058
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:13,190
healthy right what is that smooth that's

1059
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:14,690
actually the fat that's how the plants

1060
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:17,210
telling you it's fat and happy

1061
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:20,210
it's literally making its learning

1062
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:23,510
lipids lipids huh it's called the waxy

1063
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:26,030
cuticle that makes it tracks I didn't

1064
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,950
know its facts the plants will grow a

1065
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,930
new growth ice I will plant but I'm a

1066
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:31,549
fat flinch I saved all the new growth

1067
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:33,949
where it looks almost like plastic

1068
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:36,260
that's almost like plastic and then what

1069
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:38,869
happens usually people the temperature

1070
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:42,560
increases and what happens like they'll

1071
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:46,099
start to spread out a little bit or the

1072
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:49,190
life in the soil got stressed yeah so

1073
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:53,059
therefore it was it able you know no

1074
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:55,070
that plant knows how to grow you have to

1075
00:47:53,059 --> 00:48:00,650
give it it can adapt to tremendously

1076
00:47:55,070 --> 00:48:03,170
good it's real good at that right right

1077
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:05,510
you know I agree on the genetics right

1078
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:08,599
well in my garden literally if it

1079
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:10,790
doesn't grow sorry we tried you know

1080
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:12,500
it's one of those things where no hard

1081
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:14,900
feelings I'm not going to stress this

1082
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,420
let's check this out though so like will

1083
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,039
be cloning right and sometimes we'll

1084
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,240
have like we'll just have really good

1085
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:25,159
success on a clone and from the clone

1086
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:27,529
form to a finished product it's not a

1087
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:30,289
whole die that way looks healthy mother

1088
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:33,560
no no no say mother say mother plant

1089
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:36,199
TRAI clones from same mother but that

1090
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:39,199
one tray or no like a handful of plants

1091
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:40,939
in that tray are just like me like they

1092
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:42,949
yield more they're they have less

1093
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:46,869
problems they grow faster they just

1094
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:46,869
they're like they they're just dumb

1095
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,120
I would find out who's that cutter is

1096
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:55,510
there a way to like even it out

1097
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:57,719
afterwards you know because we seem that

1098
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:01,270
it seems to be the only workaround is to

1099
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:03,369
make twice as many plants as we need so

1100
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:05,710
and then it select the best of half of

1101
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:08,289
those to get the most robust ones but

1102
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:10,449
you know for to take a plant that's hurt

1103
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:17,860
and bring it back you know to full

1104
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:20,349
strength is like why can't you because

1105
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:23,349
we're out we're farmers on a time crunch

1106
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:25,420
basically scale that's all the time yeah

1107
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:27,069
it's a produce to survive and make it

1108
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,480
pencil we have to be at a certain scale

1109
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:30,490
that's right so now we're just talking

1110
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,860
about having the right tool to do the

1111
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:35,529
right job so that the force whatever

1112
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,990
team you have can get the job done so

1113
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:39,190
you can then go and have fun with your

1114
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:43,719
friends and take your kids to the beach

1115
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:46,210
right you know it's like okay there is

1116
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:49,869
an entire world and universe of

1117
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:59,710
creatures that their sole purpose is to

1118
00:49:49,869 --> 00:50:01,900
love on your planet I get that you're

1119
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,460
trying to cut 1,500 to like I have

1120
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,579
another place so it's putting 11,000

1121
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:09,490
clones a weird you know like so there is

1122
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:12,429
like that degree and there is like when

1123
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:13,899
you're with anything with more like more

1124
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:15,759
margin for error because you're

1125
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,369
increasing in your numbers and a lot of

1126
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,300
it I think is like accidental

1127
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:24,339
contamination in between how like the

1128
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,380
light cycle the moms are and like where

1129
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,450
you're cutting you know compared to the

1130
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,610
health you know cuz like and you could

1131
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:32,919
solve that by a testing like doing brick

1132
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:35,710
testing or like tissue testing in the

1133
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,360
top middle or bottom to see you know if

1134
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:39,670
it's if those nutrients are actually

1135
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,510
going all the way up where the cuts are

1136
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,809
coming from on that mom

1137
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:46,430
but he was determining even then I mean

1138
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,989
we did like a lot of clone trials we

1139
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:50,659
have a grow cube product that we're

1140
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:53,838
really seeing that it's like inoculated

1141
00:50:50,659 --> 00:50:56,509
with all of our biology so I'm gonna

1142
00:50:53,838 --> 00:51:00,799
introduce it to the light even if it's

1143
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:03,710
not in soil because it coats it and then

1144
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,960
helps it's called the biosphere platform

1145
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:08,389
it's beautiful knits this whole world

1146
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,329
right along the route that can happen

1147
00:51:08,389 --> 00:51:16,279
inside an indoor go - you guys got a

1148
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:18,200
product yes so we've seen a lot of like

1149
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,970
you know we're creating it pretty much

1150
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:22,639
you know generates the plants immune

1151
00:51:19,969 --> 00:51:24,799
system from day one so a lot of the

1152
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:26,480
issues like the biggest thing to of like

1153
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,890
when production if you have a tray that

1154
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,990
goes bad and dies well they're going to

1155
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:32,269
mold you don't find them or there's one

1156
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:35,000
that's bad in the middle and it just

1157
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:36,440
takes one and it spreads and so that's

1158
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,510
where like we came in and we were

1159
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,980
working with these cats it has like whew

1160
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:41,930
sorry oh I'm they had like three

1161
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:45,500
different kinds or like in my sees like

1162
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:47,838
water mold in their clone room and it

1163
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,550
would just contaminate and recontaminate

1164
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,250
and so that's the biggest thing we saw

1165
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:53,430
from our cubes as they didn't get p.m.

1166
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,650
from it they were

1167
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:58,409
there's enough good guys to eat the PM

1168
00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:00,180
but a lot of it was cloning like actual

1169
00:51:58,409 --> 00:52:01,190
routing and success of cloning its

1170
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:04,739
humidity

1171
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:07,619
it's like you want 90% humidity for like

1172
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:10,469
three to five days then 70 and then like

1173
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:12,720
over 14 days you slowly acclimate to

1174
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:20,039
room canvas every time I walk by though

1175
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:22,199
my spray what the water like I take some

1176
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:23,940
like cytokinin Zoar like something

1177
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:26,399
that's a high-end trace metals or fulvic

1178
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,440
acid that's going to be so much and

1179
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,450
digestible like if you want to think of

1180
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:35,130
like a little baby like it's you yeah

1181
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:44,818
yeah they like calcium I think your

1182
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:48,059
mom's before you cut doing moms in Swift

1183
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:51,358
alts like versus moms and soil there's

1184
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:53,369
no comparison we we had like a thing

1185
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,650
that says they hired us or we were doing

1186
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:57,690
working with them for and like I finally

1187
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,608
just applied some of our compost on the

1188
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:02,730
moms they were like in this coco coir

1189
00:52:59,608 --> 00:53:05,759
mix and within 24 hours the moms look

1190
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:08,309
great and the compost was white because

1191
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,440
it had literally just like pulled all

1192
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:13,369
the salt out and the plants are like oh

1193
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,369
I can drink again

1194
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:22,519
working with salt based systems like

1195
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:24,500
there's definitely like an ebb and flow

1196
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:26,449
you can get into with it but you're

1197
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,369
still always going to have to add more

1198
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:30,739
and add more and that's the difference

1199
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:32,329
it's like just add it once and maintain

1200
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:34,219
it and your it's gonna save you a lot of

1201
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:37,159
money your guys are here like this but I

1202
00:53:34,219 --> 00:53:40,189
went and worked on a indoor farm a real

1203
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:42,409
big thousand lighter for a day and they

1204
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,490
don't use their soil more than one time

1205
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:46,909
it's crazy

1206
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:49,789
no there's it's nuts and all that the

1207
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:56,469
rock wall is what kills me the rock and

1208
00:53:49,789 --> 00:53:59,329
the plastic trays oh the twofer just

1209
00:53:56,469 --> 00:54:00,919
it's painful it's certain you have to

1210
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:05,358
put on your like barn you know your

1211
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:07,039
blinders you just like they're like

1212
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:09,739
we'll play by the rules but we know

1213
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:12,289
plants grow in the soil yeah it's it's

1214
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:14,659
really sad but it's just more a lot of

1215
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:17,838
it is like just lack of information and

1216
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:20,449
people also don't feel like it applies

1217
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:23,239
to them or they can't it's you know like

1218
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:25,098
oh I have to tear down my whole system I

1219
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:26,809
have so much money I can't lose a day or

1220
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:28,670
production it's like finding a way to

1221
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:30,858
integrate it just like you know it's a

1222
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:33,260
succession scale you integrate it over

1223
00:54:30,858 --> 00:54:35,210
time like you should always be you know

1224
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:37,280
it's all it's a business its profit

1225
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,019
oriented you know a lot of times with

1226
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,260
big operations your profits come from

1227
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:44,119
efficiency not from numbers or yields or

1228
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:46,220
anything it's just being efficient not

1229
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:48,890
having somebody walk back and forth 20

1230
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:50,719
times you know and then he's tired but

1231
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:52,699
he actually has to go do what he needs

1232
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:54,889
to pay attention to just like little

1233
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:57,529
things like that I feel like make way

1234
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:59,449
more of a difference in like when you

1235
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:01,910
know I think that there's we have a

1236
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:04,909
really big challenge with product

1237
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:07,579
differentiation and product like the

1238
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:11,389
inner door brand just like indoor weed

1239
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:14,480
is being better is like so entrenched

1240
00:55:11,389 --> 00:55:16,400
it's it's wild it's bad it's it's so

1241
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,530
like fighting against that educate

1242
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,059
providing some type of platform or

1243
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,940
educate

1244
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:24,549
and like places like this should be open

1245
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:26,170
24 every day of the week where you can

1246
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:28,090
go to a farmers market and get some pot

1247
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:30,010
that's education right there and then

1248
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:31,720
people will start to experience where

1249
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:34,210
their weeds coming from they can meet

1250
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:36,519
the farmer you know and hopefully we

1251
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:41,019
work in that directory you know people

1252
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:44,619
out at the farmers market hell yeah hell

1253
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:46,090
yeah man that's what we're right there

1254
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:49,329
doing it right now we're living the

1255
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:51,280
dream where there's a lot of stuff going

1256
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:53,409
on and it's really cool because of

1257
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,720
Technology because of events and because

1258
00:55:53,409 --> 00:55:59,009
people are feeling more comfortable to

1259
00:55:55,719 --> 00:56:02,799
come out of a shell type you know I mean

1260
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:05,290
that that there's there's no longer the

1261
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:10,750
same feeling of aloneness right the

1262
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:13,509
garden got bigger and because of that we

1263
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:16,389
have almost it's called a quorum right

1264
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:20,200
and then the microbes have it - it's

1265
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:22,119
called quorum sensing and when you have

1266
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:25,049
bad guys on you and in you right now

1267
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:27,880
like the bad bacterias and other stuff

1268
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:30,700
they literally talk to each other and

1269
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:34,430
when they get to the right level they go

1270
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:36,788
let's party and then you get sick

1271
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:40,159
the same thing happens in your Soyuz

1272
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:42,650
right so the plants try it the soil is

1273
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:47,088
talking to you long before your plant

1274
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:49,160
turns it color because that life isn't

1275
00:56:47,088 --> 00:56:52,909
what's actually helping that plant

1276
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:57,108
processing growth and so no matter how

1277
00:56:52,909 --> 00:57:02,259
that plant grew the plant literally just

1278
00:56:57,108 --> 00:57:05,088
needs the right team to work with yeah

1279
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:09,160
I'm loving it man I'm loving seeing like

1280
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:12,710
the the regenerative stuff really work

1281
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:15,920
it really really works like without a

1282
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:18,858
doubt there's no comparison living soil

1283
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:22,970
pot is better than salt based

1284
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:26,568
mineral based longer shelf life lasts

1285
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:29,838
longer smells fresher stronger every

1286
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:33,798
time more cost-effective higher profit

1287
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:36,798
margin greater market value better smart

1288
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:38,298
or apron right all the things you you're

1289
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:41,480
supposed to talk to your marketing guy

1290
00:57:38,298 --> 00:57:43,818
about like if you grow like this like

1291
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,250
here's another example how do you prove

1292
00:57:43,818 --> 00:57:49,548
yours is different well there's actually

1293
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:54,949
tests that you can do that says my plant

1294
00:57:49,548 --> 00:57:56,778
was grown in a 98% alive soil it's

1295
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:59,328
called a Haney test and you're like what

1296
00:57:56,778 --> 00:58:01,190
you know it's like but you can say that

1297
00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:03,079
this plant is special is different

1298
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:04,818
because of how it was grown that's

1299
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,990
something else they can be added to the

1300
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:08,659
value group

1301
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:10,368
okay I heard of the hey me oh man that

1302
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:11,210
the microbes are the what creates a

1303
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:15,260
terroir

1304
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:18,110
we have tests for the microbes so you

1305
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:21,650
can literally make it tangible that says

1306
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:25,880
no this is why I'm different these are

1307
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:29,930
my creatures my team you guys have any

1308
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:33,820
like isolated like specific the like way

1309
00:58:29,929 --> 00:58:36,980
doable striking derma or Glomus or

1310
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:40,250
bacillus or like or do you guys is that

1311
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:41,900
your NOC Yulin is yeah like a full

1312
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,550
spectrum kind of thing or you have to

1313
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,160
select microbes to like because I know

1314
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:49,519
for like mother plants to get more

1315
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:52,250
apical growth the tract of dermis and

1316
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:55,849
the route seems to really work well and

1317
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:58,429
also for like botrytis prevention you

1318
00:58:55,849 --> 00:59:03,949
know in the root it's it's tremendous

1319
00:58:58,429 --> 00:59:06,618
the hard c annum its benefits to me it's

1320
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:09,079
like kind of like you know you don't

1321
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:11,480
want to use that until like you know you

1322
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:14,358
really like it doesn't it overtakes

1323
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,130
everything else so you have to use it

1324
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:17,719
sparingly a lot of the Trichoderma

1325
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,510
products like i've looked at under the

1326
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:21,739
scope and they don't really germinate

1327
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:23,750
and a lot of people don't like you have

1328
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:25,579
to refrigerate them for sure and there's

1329
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:29,179
definitely ones that are more viable

1330
00:59:25,579 --> 00:59:32,059
than others and different strains that's

1331
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:34,940
like we don't really work with it at all

1332
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:36,889
I haven't need to but I do believe like

1333
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:42,050
I think they all work better together

1334
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:44,269
it's when like the the bacteria you know

1335
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:46,160
that like in the nematode eats the

1336
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:48,019
protozoa and that's cycling and

1337
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:50,899
digesting and you create you know I

1338
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:52,730
think but we also do offer we have our

1339
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,500
endophyte product that's in our grow

1340
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:56,659
cubes that's a specific class of

1341
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,460
bacteria and that colonizes in the plant

1342
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,989
tissue so it's really good for moms

1343
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,260
there's something in a pox it's never

1344
00:59:59,989 --> 01:00:07,039
gonna wash tout it's it's actually a

1345
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:09,470
specific type of in a fight that helps

1346
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,179
like what a song about polysaccharides

1347
01:00:09,469 --> 01:00:13,459
are systemic

1348
01:00:11,179 --> 01:00:15,469
it's an Indo fight so it's that's what

1349
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:17,119
it's inside the plant tissue that's what

1350
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:24,639
that means for so yeah you could say

1351
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:27,108
systemic organic systemic plant booster

1352
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:29,868
the game I like to think it was like the

1353
01:00:27,108 --> 01:00:31,909
gate keeper you know it's just like it's

1354
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:34,070
really good also for for breaking down

1355
01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:38,420
like salts or Crees increasing salinity

1356
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:40,880
tolerance you know salt soil yeah we see

1357
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:43,280
a lot of success using it in like

1358
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,440
hydroponics situations but you can

1359
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,980
remediate salt soil too with compost

1360
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:51,650
really well yeah and you just cycle it

1361
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:56,300
mix it in let it sit you know and by

1362
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:58,400
spring also in the East Bay and soil

1363
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:01,970
salinity is a big problem out there with

1364
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,559
like the all the farmers pretty much are

1365
01:01:01,969 --> 01:01:06,078
you guys doing anything with non

1366
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:08,299
cannabis farms help them grow like

1367
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,250
remediate the fields with and stuff like

1368
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:14,810
that they could use some help with that

1369
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:21,050
definitely be open to it you know oh

1370
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:23,750
okay all types and stuff if the job is

1371
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:26,960
the same and we have the team to do the

1372
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:29,389
job all the microbes you just got to get

1373
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:33,760
them to the right got to create the

1374
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:33,759
environment the conditions in the system

1375
01:01:34,809 --> 01:01:45,009
do you always give them analogies in

1376
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:45,010
micro terms the cakes in cooking

1377
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:53,179
my children have their own plants they

1378
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,409
helped bury genetics my kids play in the

1379
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:57,858
garden they

1380
01:01:54,409 --> 01:02:00,679
no different it's so fun I love it they

1381
01:01:57,858 --> 01:02:02,509
don't have any of the drama it's

1382
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:06,949
literally just the happiest place on

1383
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:09,589
earth my kid this season is you know not

1384
01:02:06,949 --> 01:02:12,250
very start but he's like dad I want to

1385
01:02:09,588 --> 01:02:14,779
do an experiment I'm like sure whatever

1386
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:18,048
and he's like I want to see if peas

1387
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:22,730
changed the pH he's seven

1388
01:02:18,048 --> 01:02:24,739
right and I'm like I don't know let's

1389
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:28,789
check and so we put out and did a little

1390
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:32,868
soil or a water pH and he tested it he's

1391
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:34,339
like how many peas because he

1392
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:37,338
understands about dose because we

1393
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:40,179
measure stuff to put because there's

1394
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:44,599
small life a small amount packs a punch

1395
01:02:40,179 --> 01:02:47,568
like they do that job right and so he's

1396
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:49,548
like let's start with ten peas and he's

1397
01:02:47,568 --> 01:02:51,650
like chuffing peas and putting it into

1398
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:58,699
the peach and then we tested the pH and

1399
01:02:51,650 --> 01:03:01,579
guess what it doesn't it is open now you

1400
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:03,409
don't because they did holy crap

1401
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:06,920
we haven't had a new way that changed pH

1402
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:09,828
who knew you know so she's okay to

1403
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:13,400
experiments are you talking about the

1404
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:15,260
pea the plant peas are urine we've done

1405
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,579
both okay but you're talking about

1406
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:25,250
you're in the whole time that's what I

1407
01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:29,589
know we're gonna have to be much okay I

1408
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:29,588
gotcha I would think that maybe alkaline

1409
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:38,690
but you're saying nitrogen is there's

1410
01:03:35,869 --> 01:03:40,519
different types of nitrogen though like

1411
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:43,630
we're playing with nitrate based

1412
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:46,608
nitrogen versus ammoniacal nitrogen

1413
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:49,410
there's a difference in how soluble they

1414
01:03:46,608 --> 01:03:53,610
are right yeah all right

1415
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:55,500
how much nitrogen does your plant we

1416
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:56,430
have been honored not as much as a lot

1417
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,860
of people will give them

1418
01:03:56,429 --> 01:04:01,559
we have bacteria that literally fix

1419
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:04,769
nitrogen out of the air into the soil

1420
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:08,579
the azo spur ileum right you got that

1421
01:04:04,769 --> 01:04:10,800
part of the team too right if like I

1422
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:14,610
only had one thing to a change farming

1423
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:17,490
stop make like nitrogen illegal if you

1424
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:20,970
change that one input and you just stop

1425
01:04:17,489 --> 01:04:23,009
doing that it would change cover crop

1426
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:25,500
with legumes and get plenty nitrogen

1427
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:27,330
right change clothing howes it's like a

1428
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,159
hundred pounds an acre they can fix a

1429
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:31,230
and then I think like the legumes can do

1430
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:33,000
like 200 or something yeah it's like

1431
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:39,900
this is where your cover is is it like

1432
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:42,079
working all your livestock at leas yeah

1433
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:46,289
no it's it's absolutely amazing that

1434
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:49,349
it's alive and the more diverse through

1435
01:04:46,289 --> 01:04:51,690
more crazy the more intensive how high

1436
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:53,849
is your garden what do you mean your

1437
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:55,710
Gardens three-dimensional you can have

1438
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:57,269
understory plants and the middle story

1439
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:59,880
plants and in the middle right here

1440
01:04:57,269 --> 01:05:02,610
because they branch out over like you

1441
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:07,890
can change everything with layers of

1442
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:10,329
life with the understanding as above so

1443
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:15,139
below

1444
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:17,630
all that life is like an exploding the

1445
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:19,230
surface of the earth and it's feeling

1446
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:24,980
the plane

1447
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:24,980
and us and the buses yeah absolutely

1448
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:31,159
cool right on yeah we're going for a

1449
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:31,159
minute
