1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,819
CDFA has been in Humboldt right there

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,349
setting up Hummels offices and how has

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,388
that potentially impacted the

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:13,289
regulations right this latest edition I

5
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:14,699
mean I feel like as I see FA right and

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:17,939
probably groups that you've worked with

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:21,210
to sequoia we've for the last year or

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,039
more 18 months have put in comment that

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,539
light deprivation needs to be allowed in

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,269
the outdoor tier but what I was

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,230
fascinated by CDFA being up in Humboldt

12
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:33,000
doing inspections was that I had a

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,920
number of farmers tell me that the

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,850
inspectors came to their farms where

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,670
there is these you know to harvest like

16
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,890
seasonal facilities where all the tarps

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,570
go away all the fans come out all those

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,670
you know any lighting that's there if

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,600
they're sunny goes away for the winter

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,640
and cbfa repeatedly noted that they were

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,649
amazed by what they were seeing they had

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,739
no idea that light deprivation could

23
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,948
happen without supplemental lighting and

24
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:06,329
they had no idea that it was happening

25
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:08,399
on such a I don't know me me a kind of a

26
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:10,590
traditional or rudimentary scale right

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,689
we don't have these you know gutter

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,750
connect greenhouses we literally have

29
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:20,099
people tilling the ground and adding

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:23,009
amendments and they have very you know

31
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,500
they have very low tax structures and

32
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,478
they're using very simple farming

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,900
techniques that I mean their outdoor

34
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:33,209
they are subject to all the elements yet

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,280
it's so amazing that there hasn't been

36
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,019
any shift in the under in the in the

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,920
regulations showing that they understood

38
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:43,500
that this exists you know they obviously

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,920
created different pricing tiers for

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,478
other licenses if

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,010
we're able to see that that was

42
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,719
happening you would have thought that

43
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,060
there was some kind of additional

44
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,189
licensing tears maybe for light

45
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,519
derivation without any supplemental well

46
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:58,599
I mean I was hoping I was hoping that if

47
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,719
nothing else they would have kind of

48
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,309
broadened the scale of pricing right so

49
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,679
there was some more opportunities and

50
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,050
that kind of in-between outdoor and ml1

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,659
tear because I mean the vast majority of

52
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,910
the farmers like the longtime farmers

53
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:14,590
have developed their property with you

54
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:18,400
know a little bit of outdoor full terms

55
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,860
some ml1 activities happening and it's

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,110
really a matter of resources and

57
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,000
convenience and having the timing to

58
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,550
manage that farm with a low amount of

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,620
staff and being as mellow on the

60
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,689
landscape as possible I think it falls

61
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,730
back to the farmers eating the ability

62
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:34,989
to be flexible with the circumstances

63
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:37,299
that they have when you talk about their

64
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,000
elements and recent other resources and

65
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,830
being able to respond to those the way a

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,780
farmer does which is by fixing the

67
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,540
situation with the solution without

68
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,550
having to have you know government

69
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:50,289
really is now telling them how they can

70
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,780
run their farm without really

71
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:54,310
understanding how a farm is run and they

72
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,110
and they don't have the flexibility to

73
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,780
be though to be a farmer and make those

74
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,489
decisions on the fly you know if a

75
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,959
farmer is farming and all of a sudden

76
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,519
there's a heavy rain coming that they

77
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,840
didn't expect they want to be able to

78
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,909
put up a tarp because that's what they

79
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,650
do now all of a sudden they can't just

80
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:10,180
put a tarp up and cover their crop and

81
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,129
protect it from the rain because they'll

82
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,469
get in trouble for having the wrong

83
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:16,209
license for that practice the

84
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:17,829
regulator's have no idea about cannabis

85
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,689
the regulator's that have been chosen to

86
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:21,790
regulate cannabis have no idea about

87
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:23,590
cannabis because the people that do know

88
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:24,729
about cannabis the regulator's feel they

89
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,200
don't trust them because they were

90
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:28,149
working in the illicit market and it's

91
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,250
like this attached wente to where the

92
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,840
people that should be the ones making

93
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,780
the decisions about the regulations

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,219
can't because they were doing it for so

95
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,810
long that they were part of an illicit

96
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:39,039
market that means the regulator's don't

97
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,349
trust them to come in and make the

98
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,239
regulations and it's like it was who we

99
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,599
end up having the situation where the

100
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,829
regulations do not match the reality

101
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,829
right there's

102
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,449
which is either the control or the

103
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:08,389
information or the money but I also

104
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:10,549
think that regulators in many cases like

105
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:13,489
to look to other programs that have been

106
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,549
adopted and utilized in other areas

107
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,980
right so canvas programs in Colorado and

108
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:21,759
Washington state right and not a lot of

109
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,920
them include outdoor cultivation and

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,800
those programs were established and then

111
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,420
birthed in industry so here we are 20

112
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,579
plus years down the road of California

113
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,610
with us very robust industry and trying

114
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:37,250
to take those very linear programs right

115
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,710
which are you know trying to cram that

116
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:43,100
squareness into our round way of life

117
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:44,750
right it's not necessarily working and

118
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,450
we're really far away from the

119
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,610
regulators so I think the point was CDFA

120
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:51,469
coming up and what is that doing for us

121
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,270
I think there's there a little too

122
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,800
little a little too late right like they

123
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:56,750
showed up too late

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,990
in the regulatory process to actually

125
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,399
understand what the farmers need what

126
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,168
they're going through what the

127
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:07,370
challenges in the struggles are so here

128
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:10,189
they are in August having in September

129
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,259
having their first inspections on these

130
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:15,379
farms and there are the oldest farms

131
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:18,139
that are trying the hardest to take

132
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:20,689
their square farm and cram it into a

133
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:24,229
round hole and it doesn't it doesn't

134
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:25,790
work that way I feel like sometimes I

135
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,819
feel like they are listening and they

136
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,500
are very intrigued and interested in

137
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:32,149
what's going on and they are trying to

138
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,949
come to the farms and see these things

139
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:35,839
and understand what's going on and then

140
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:38,029
something happens between that them

141
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,918
seeing and understanding and then going

142
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,839
back and making regulations I don't know

143
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,060
if there's some other influence or some

144
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,329
other well it's both of those things so

145
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,870
there's a lot of very now well financed

146
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:53,539
sectors of the industry that are in the

147
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,490
rooms with lobbyists all the time so

148
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,990
that's definitely happening and then I

149
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,519
think also these folks are fighting

150
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,310
cognitive dissonance of reefer madness

151
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,500
like they're still trying to not

152
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,959
feel that cannabis plants are dangerous

153
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,029
they feel it deep inside themselves and

154
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:09,649
even though now intellectually they're

155
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:11,539
understanding it differently and they're

156
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:13,729
seeing images that are replacing that

157
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,890
feeling they still come back and then

158
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,990
they're still like oh but I'm still

159
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,689
really kind of scared and and I feel

160
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,030
like that's something we have to deal

161
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,620
with that that reefer madness is still

162
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:26,299
going to hold on for a little bit longer

163
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,829
and it's going to show up in these regs

164
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,460
it's gonna show up and being afraid of

165
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:30,919
sun-grown

166
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:33,259
and being afraid of social consumption

167
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,689
and being afraid of farmers selling them

168
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,279
to consumers and that's still very much

169
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:38,959
rooted in reefer madness well and and

170
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,639
one of the biggest reefer madness things

171
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,829
like to feel like I saw in the ranks was

172
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,349
this language about changing the

173
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:48,709
definition of immature plant to anything

174
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:51,110
18 inches wide or 18 inches tall and I

175
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:53,539
don't even understand how this is gonna

176
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,689
work I think I see some impacts but they

177
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:59,990
only did it in CD pH MVCC regulations

178
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:02,600
and then the cultivation regulations so

179
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,910
while it doesn't necessarily change a

180
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,010
farmer's ability to propagate and at

181
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,480
what time they they're propagated

182
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,060
material moves into their flowering

183
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,770
canopy it's gonna totally change the

184
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:17,569
nursery industry so if BCC says that you

185
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,310
know I'm mature and immature plan is

186
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:21,110
anything smaller than 18 inches tall and

187
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,490
18 inches wide those are the only plants

188
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,530
that can be transported through a

189
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,829
distributor the only plants that can be

190
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:29,629
sold at a retailer and so someone who's

191
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:32,209
a cultivator that is a micro business

192
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:34,819
who is a supposed to follow the rules in

193
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:37,849
the cbfa regs that states it's one way

194
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:40,219
and be follow the rules that the BCC has

195
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,530
developed for micro businesses that has

196
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,460
different definition that's why we need

197
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:49,099
to go smoke pot right bringing around

198
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:51,139
how I will ever get seed plants again is

199
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,939
really hard I feel like it's just so

200
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:57,769
fascinating because it's like we're

201
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:01,430
supposed to be though in this whole

202
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:03,199
equation of like government and us we're

203
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,019
supposed to be the ones that don't

204
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,209
understand things and are like making

205
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,529
things that contradict each other and

206
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:11,269
aren't making sense like that's supposed

207
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:14,019
to be us we're supposed to be the

208
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:15,848
stoners but I feel like we're

209
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:18,758
sitting here trying to explain this in

210
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:21,098
like the most basic like first greater

211
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:25,330
level and then regulators are just like

212
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:27,788
smoking something and it's like it's

213
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:29,918
almost just like this weird reality

214
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:36,968
we're like the stoners know what to do

215
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:40,538
and the government is just like I mean

216
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:42,550
in all fairness right regulate a 20 plus

217
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:45,639
year old industry has got to be really

218
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:47,289
really hard right easier if you ask the

219
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:51,939
people from the industry how to do it

220
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:53,588
and listen to them it's a lot easier is

221
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,970
a sign of over-regulation because

222
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:57,070
there's too much regulation that's

223
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,930
crossing over and not connecting and

224
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:06,730
causing problems with other regulation

225
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:13,809
that is make I want a shirt that says

226
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:15,459
over regulated like a bitch you know all

227
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:18,039
these other industries are regulated and

228
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:19,869
I feel like I think we were all kind not

229
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,909
all but I feel like we were ready for it

230
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,709
somewhat and we're ready for there to be

231
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:25,719
some kind of rules to follow and to be

232
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:28,119
accountable but it is too much because

233
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,430
it was a section of this in California

234
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,799
that's the problem I mean if we were

235
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:34,778
cannabis in some other state it would be

236
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,969
easier if we were another industry in

237
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:39,220
California it would be easier but the

238
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,379
fact that we're cannabis which is over

239
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,269
regulated everywhere and we're

240
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:47,799
California that over regulates

241
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:49,870
everything we have it bad I mean it like

242
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,199
it literally is a shitstorm created by

243
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,820
how we have do business in our state

244
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,290
intersecting with how states do business

245
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,620
with cannabis and we probably have more

246
00:09:56,289 --> 00:10:01,599
agencies involved than any other

247
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,828
cannabis program you want to plan it so

248
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,690
more taxes more more agencies so we have

249
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:10,088
the three primary regulators but if

250
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,889
you're a cultivator you also have fish

251
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:18,149
and wildlife and the water boards

252
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:25,769
the tax agency so it's elaborate it's

253
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:27,539
tiring we're exhausted you are it's

254
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:29,989
starting to become a dangerous place my

255
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,988
friends

256
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:39,308
you

257
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,309
