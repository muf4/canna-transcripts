1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,580
my own background on this issue is I was

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:07,139
contacted by three different NFL teams

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,929
technically I was hired by a criminal

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:12,928
defense lawyer in in in two of the cases

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,388
who was working with teams because what

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:19,679
we saw going on in the late 2000s early

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:23,309
2011 2010 2011 period was that you had a

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:26,070
bunch of doctors affiliated with NFL

9
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:28,259
teams who were a little bit wowed by the

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,320
celebrity of being around NFL players

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,960
and what we saw was just all the rules

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,869
went out the door security secured sort

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,789
of storage of prescription medications

14
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,530
vicodin was like it was you know you

15
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,079
talk about pill we talked about pill

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,939
mills being places where doctors were

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,558
just giving out the opioids they weren't

18
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,210
selling them on NFL teams they were just

19
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,250
giving them out and putting them in the

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,420
hands of players and not practicing

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,079
medicine they were debating just

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,780
enabling a bad culture so so if they Ana

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,910
if the NFL Players Association wanted to

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,879
work with me what I would say first and

25
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,890
foremost is we need the conversation

26
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,739
needs to get outside of just talking to

27
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,420
to goodall's office right that the

28
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:13,259
bottom line is the commissioner and the

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,920
league have been so myopic and so locked

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,320
down on the potential for cannabis to be

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,180
a difference maker and also to the

32
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:22,829
destructive role that opioids are

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,130
playing the role in which they're

34
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:29,099
masking pain serious nerve damage and

35
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,390
and and just and leading to a physical

36
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,669
dependency that's leaving so many

37
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,790
players both still in the league and

38
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,349
retired really suffering and so I I

39
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,810
think this needs to be a national

40
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:41,938
conversation and I think the Players

41
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,799
Association needs to take that message

42
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:46,228
to the American public right the

43
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,710
American public has stood with NFL

44
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:51,000
players on the concussion issues on

45
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,699
their concerns around concussions

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,718
there's a deep sympathy right everyone

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,009
was shocked when when when Nike created

48
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:01,859
like a campaign that was really heroic

49
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,269
around NFL players I know is divisive

50
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,239
but I'm saying for that was heroic

51
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:08,429
around players standing up for what they

52
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,500
believed in so I think that the NFL

53
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,628
Players Association should go to the

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,800
American public and really taken make an

55
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:16,319
advocacy advocacy

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,120
playing campaign that will get this away

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,359
from roger goodell and and in the hands

58
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,520
of and make this a concern that the that

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,800
the that the the league is you know

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,570
understands that viewers are unhappy

61
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,590
that the league is essentially

62
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:34,109
perpetuating the opioid crisis right and

63
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,939
missing a huge opportunity to offer a

64
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,430
new therapeutic and i think that is an

65
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,560
awareness that starts with awareness and

66
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,930
that starts with players sharing their

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,780
stories and and i'm excited to hear from

68
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,900
Cosima and i and I really think you know

69
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,780
hearing from players currently dealing

70
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,560
with the the stress on the human body of

71
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,319
playing football and alumni veterans who

72
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,699
are living with the effects after the

73
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,500
extent to which people are sacrificing

74
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,719
their bodies and and the role that

75
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,330
opioids are playing I think would be

76
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,669
just mind-boggling for and I think I

77
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,930
think people would people care right I

78
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:15,269
remember 1996 I was I was just a baby

79
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,280
lawyer back then but when Brett Favre

80
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,290
was addicted to vicodin when that came

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,449
out that just like blew my world like I

82
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,799
I and and it was amazing to me to think

83
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:24,629
back how that didn't register with

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
everybody you know it was just another

85
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,129
story of one person's addiction we

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,509
didn't think about it in a systemic way

87
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,669
so what I would say to the Players

88
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,799
Association is you've got such an

89
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,539
opportunity this moment in time we're

90
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,510
just we're really just beginning to wrap

91
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:42,509
our heads around you know how big this

92
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:44,129
crisis is and to take people who so many

93
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:46,859
Americans look up to to might you know

94
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:50,489
my own kids I have four kids you know

95
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,840
who are really like their heroes are I

96
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,180
don't want to be unpopular in LA I'm

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,489
from a Detroit Lions fan I know Kasim I

98
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,459
know you spend a year or two there but

99
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,319
uh but but to be able to like I think I

100
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,360
think that's an issue that gets through

101
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,639
to people and that would move the needle

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,400
and getting away from just letting the

103
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,958
league a you know tell its own story on

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,080
this would be all the difference in the

105
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,080
world
