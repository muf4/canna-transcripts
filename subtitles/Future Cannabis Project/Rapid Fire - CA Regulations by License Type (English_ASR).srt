2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,388
we're gonna do the rapid-fire they think

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,710
it's fun and pure to do it we'll go

4
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,169
through each license type and what is

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,580
the good the bad and the ugly that came

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,810
from the permanent rakes where do you

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:20,399
want to start let's start started

8
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,210
nursery and I think we're interesting

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,339
about nursery is that there's still on

10
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,589
these definitions I'm gonna switch gears

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,149
from nursery to the situation that

12
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,700
there's two definitions for immature

13
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,199
plant that you cannot get the Bureau of

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,329
canvas control and the California

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,890
Department of Food and Agriculture to

16
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,410
agree on what the definition of an

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,200
immature plant is and and there is this

18
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:46,109
residual this understanding of how tall

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
it should be right and I think you I

20
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:51,719
tell my clients look for the intent is

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,149
the intent for you to sell the the clone

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,160
or the immature plant to a consumer

23
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,558
where's the intent for it to stay in the

24
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,939
upper part of the supply chain in the

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,769
cultivation and that's how you're going

26
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,759
to assess which definition you use

27
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,469
because we just simply could not find

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,290
consistency in nursery so I think that

29
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,810
was a great one moving on new you want

30
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,060
to do cultivation the premise diagram

31
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,950
was the most concerning for me that

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,600
really screwed up I think a lot of

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,719
people's existing premise diagrams

34
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,548
existing local authorizations and that's

35
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,400
gonna be a big thing to grapple with and

36
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,520
whether or not CDFA is going to be open

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,460
to this new form of local authorization

38
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,879
versus an express to local permit I

39
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:39,000
think it's gonna either show to be

40
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:42,209
promising and a conduit for most

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,040
operators to leverage and if it's not

42
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:48,478
it's gonna be a real big problem with

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,290
reconfiguration premise moving things

44
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,239
around lots of efficiency loss of space

45
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,009
so for me from cultivation point of view

46
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,530
that was one of the biggest things that

47
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,868
I saw I think the other thing to talk

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,269
about in terms of cultivation license

49
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:06,810
types cultivation licensees specifically

50
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:08,399
is not necessarily the implications of

51
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,039
the regulations but the implication of

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,729
under statutory ability to issue

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,089
temporary licenses the

54
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:19,060
the super rush of applications that

55
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,280
happen on up until the end of 2018 of

56
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,199
everybody applying for temporary

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,909
authorizations and it's going to be

58
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,000
quite interesting to see how many of

59
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:29,409
those end up on persevering and being

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
able to file a sufficient amount of

61
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:33,009
documents to be able to be eligible for

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,480
those provisional license types I think

63
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:38,889
that that many of these applications

64
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:41,229
were prospective at best and I would in

65
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:44,500
this context buyer beware if you're an

66
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:46,060
investor into what purports to be a

67
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,340
fully licensed state compliant

68
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,590
cultivation operation they don't have

69
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,810
pathway to provisional let alone annual

70
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,269
um that that this might have been

71
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,590
frankly a waste of time on the part of

72
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:58,810
the state licensing authorities to

73
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,280
process all of these aspirational

74
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,920
temporary applications at the

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,629
cultivation level one little important

76
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,479
practice tip two that I've noticed is

77
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:10,000
that a lot of operators especially when

78
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:12,399
putting SOPs in place which is--what's--

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,310
protects you from enforcement actions

80
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,099
and also helps to draft core corrective

81
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,680
actions is that it is important to note

82
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:24,909
that regulators did not feel like they

83
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:29,079
needed to put statutory language into

84
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:31,629
the regulations because it's hardwired

85
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,129
in by statute like this little thing and

86
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,780
I'm we're jumping around but this was

87
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:37,900
important because we saw a bunch of

88
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,259
billboards around as we drove up to do

89
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,209
this alive taming today they do not have

90
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:44,768
permit numbers do you know why in the

91
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,479
regulations it says nowhere in that

92
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,189
advertising section that you need to

93
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,750
have your license number on there that's

94
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:51,909
because it is in the business and

95
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,459
Professions Code in the statute and it

96
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:56,889
says you must have at minimum your

97
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,079
license number that means it must be on

98
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:01,629
every billboard that must that means

99
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,969
when you do your social media it needs

100
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:06,129
to be there it lives synonymous with

101
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,439
your logo that's what I like to say your

102
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:11,318
logo and your license number should be

103
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,598
like a united front and anywhere one is

104
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:16,930
the other one likely will need to be if

105
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:19,168
you are doing advertisements so you have

106
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,269
to be looking at the at the statutory

107
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:23,879
requirements as well as the regulations

108
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,799
they are together and

109
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,350
that the regulations reference such as

110
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,090
the outdoor advertising act or the

111
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,189
poison prevention act or anything else

112
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:34,709
you need to go down the rabbit hole and

113
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,959
read it you are not just responsible for

114
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:40,199
cannabis compliance you are responsible

115
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,789
for compliance across the continuum of

116
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:52,469
anything that touches your business so

117
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:54,569
that's just like a universal point yeah

118
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,760
you want that license number to be there

119
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:59,339
that's hardwired in statute if you were

120
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:03,750
doing an advertisement and you are

121
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:07,259
respond to the BCC that says an act

122
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,540
omission or failure of any advertising

123
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,769
or marketing company that you hire is

124
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,420
the act

125
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:17,579
omission or failure of the licensee so

126
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,160
if you will hire an advertising company

127
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:22,829
to go out and market for you I hope that

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,520
they have comp audience compilation data

129
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:28,409
that shows that 71 point six percent and

130
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,629
don't ask me how they came up with 71

131
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,250
point six percent but that's 71 point

132
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:35,219
six percent of the audience that's going

133
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,139
to be viewing this advertisement is over

134
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,440
the age of 21 and it's your

135
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,810
responsibility to keep that data on you

136
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,149
on-site with you and in your

137
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,160
record-keeping and they only tell you

138
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:48,750
what audience compilation data is not

139
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,310
they don't tell you what it is so you

140
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,240
need to rely and pay that forward in any

141
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,980
agreement that you have with these

142
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,579
social media it's the same as with your

143
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:01,830
employees like we saw with the labs if

144
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:03,990
you go back and look at that any act or

145
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:05,669
mission or failure of the employee is

146
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,560
the act omission or failure of your

147
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,509
license II look at Sequoia labs right

148
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,990
they said well it was the employee we

149
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:14,099
didn't know they don't care that is your

150
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,310
responsibility and you are just as

151
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,110
culpable as anybody executor anybody

152
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,290
making those determinations and

153
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,949
decisions at your business so those I

154
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:28,350
think are important takeaways from that

155
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:31,139
that was a manufacturer's ad that we saw

156
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,930
on the way here it's remarried

157
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:37,889
the license number two great nice and

158
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,810
summer it is a delicious cookie yeah we

159
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:41,519
know that it's a delicious cookie but

160
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,620
you still got to be compliant with your

161
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,569
advertising put a sticker on it just

162
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,949
like with packaging and labeling let's

163
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,909
talk about manufacturers that's my

164
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,979
favorite yeah

165
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,860
regulatory whiplash are you pre till I

166
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,710
won or Post July when do you want CRP on

167
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,670
the retailers bags and my point of fact

168
00:06:55,709 --> 00:07:02,219
is don't take in product after May June

169
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:06,090
July that you may not sell out of

170
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:09,480
because there is no more grace period

171
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:11,849
come Jan run of twenty twenty CRP at the

172
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,069
product level so if you think that

173
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,260
you're gonna go three syllables out

174
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:19,500
resume yes if you think you're gonna go

175
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:24,180
all the way to December not putting CRP

176
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,790
on your products buyer beware be will

177
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,829
buyer beware of the the retailer beware

178
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,110
at the manufacturer that they that may

179
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:33,329
be defective product coming back to you

180
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,449
that needs to be replaced

181
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:38,490
so where is the agency's giveth they

182
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:42,180
give us a little bit every time with a

183
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:44,189
with a poison pill so it's up to you to

184
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,860
make the business decision how much is

185
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,540
it gonna cost me to do it quickly versus

186
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,759
how much is it gonna cost me to phase it

187
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,730
in and from the retailer's perspective

188
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:57,539
are you going to allow for your store to

189
00:07:53,730 --> 00:08:00,150
carry both CRP at the product level

190
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:03,000
that's resealable or not and are you

191
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:04,620
going to invest in using your CRP exit

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,670
bags let's talk about another issue at

193
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,199
the manufacturing level and

194
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,449
unfortunately there's not much to talk

195
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,519
about because the localities have not

196
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:14,129
issued a Pamela was talking earlier

197
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,719
before about how the processor license

198
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:16,469
types might often not understood at the

199
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,820
local level

200
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,710
well there's one license type that's

201
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,659
absolutely not understood at the local

202
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:24,719
level and that's the shared license type

203
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,420
on that is it's been available as of the

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,420
regulations from emanated from the rate

205
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,789
from the regulatory authorities and and

206
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,860
it needs to be explicitly enabled in

207
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,839
local ordinance for that to be an

208
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,399
approved license type and what the

209
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,810
shared manufacturing license type we're

210
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,168
all familiar with commercial kitchens

211
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:44,028
whereby different operators can come in

212
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,919
for a couple of hours do what they need

213
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:48,820
to do and and then clean up after

214
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,870
themselves and allow for another

215
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,389
entrepreneur to come in and share the

216
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,850
space well we don't have that anywhere

217
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:56,870
in the state so yet again it's the local

218
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,670
authorities it's the local

219
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,448
municipalities that are failing to

220
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:04,360
understand what the state is trying to

221
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:06,469
implement and try to manifest a

222
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,019
licensing structure that's reasonably

223
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,360
well that's reasonably drafted and well

224
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:13,669
thought through and provides licensing

225
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,019
pathways for businesses that are out

226
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,149
there for struggling entrepreneurs

227
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:19,039
particularly we know not necessarily in

228
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:22,100
the extraction space but in the infused

229
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:24,649
space there's quite a lot of boutique

230
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,300
food producers that would love to be

231
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,220
able to add cannabis to their products

232
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:31,309
and have a difficult time finding a

233
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,528
licensed premise that's great these are

234
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:35,719
these are small businesses each of which

235
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:38,088
would need to get a business license in

236
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,278
the jurisdiction each of which would be

237
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,480
paying revenue on a percentage of

238
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,490
revenues back towards the local

239
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,000
jurisdiction and obviously each of which

240
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,259
would be both creating jobs and and

241
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,299
keeping that money circulating more

242
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:52,338
locally how is it that local authorities

243
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:55,609
cannot seem to implement the shared

244
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:58,130
manufacturing license type yeah that's a

245
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,110
pickle that gets you into 50 32b but we

246
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:02,480
don't really have a whole bunch of time

247
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:05,690
to talk about that that in and of itself

248
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,820
it's a huge issue I think it's important

249
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,990
to understand that DPH is a little bit

250
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,028
more willing to have contract

251
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,769
manufacturing the issue because how

252
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:15,049
you're going to get that product to

253
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,240
market because that's what flips the

254
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:19,698
switch to getting BCC involved is the

255
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,470
distributor that's gonna a lot of its

256
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:24,169
gonna come down to contracting and so

257
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:27,170
that's really working specifically with

258
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:28,729
an attorney to understand at what point

259
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:30,559
do you want to be a financial interested

260
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,959
party at what point are you an owner

261
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,028
how are you detailing these SOPs how

262
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,909
much control does the brand actually

263
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:40,189
have you know Direction management or

264
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:42,259
control these are very specific terms

265
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,079
and you have to contract very

266
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:48,139
specifically for them into how you're

267
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,250
going to grapple with that as a brand

268
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:52,789
that doesn't necessarily have a license

269
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:55,740
that is a very high-level cursory review

270
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:57,750
but I think it's such a nuanced topic

271
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,110
that you could be talking about it for

272
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,490
an entire hour or longer to get into

273
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,919
those weeds but that's one of the

274
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,139
biggest issues I see from the BCC use

275
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,179
perspective that affects distributors I

276
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,799
mean I'd say the other uninteresting

277
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,459
conversation that's well the other

278
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:16,889
interesting aspect of discussing

279
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,080
distribution over the last of a glass

280
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:21,509
here versus of this upcoming year is

281
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,160
well last year the requirement to afford

282
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,019
a lot of your shipping manifests as well

283
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,819
as provide documentation that the proper

284
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,549
cultivation tax and excise tax were

285
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,800
collected by the distributor well this

286
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:34,859
year is when the rubber hits the road in

287
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,659
terms of real-time engagement not only

288
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,090
sometimes with the requirement to be

289
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,769
uplinked to the BCC via a track and

290
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,170
trace mechanism once that gets turned on

291
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,819
there's also some local authorities that

292
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:47,250
are also requiring participation in

293
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,129
attract and trace the mechanism what I

294
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,320
think is also going to come into the

295
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:54,379
conversation regarding the tax relief

296
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,570
bill that's been authored by

297
00:11:54,379 --> 00:12:00,269
Assemblymember Bonta my Assemblymember

298
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,970
for the second year in a row we did not

299
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,679
make the persuasive case last year that

300
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,570
we needed tax relief and it was

301
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,370
ultimately blocked in the assembly

302
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,190
Appropriations Committee now it's been

303
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:14,310
reintroduced this year but I think going

304
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,470
into that tax relief conversation we're

305
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:18,059
best suited to

306
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,339
get that tax relief granted to us if we

307
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,259
were good if we behaved well last year

308
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,820
it's going to be awfully difficult to

309
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,789
ask for tax relief if you weren't even

310
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,010
following the rules that did exist so I

311
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:30,389
don't really know how that conversation

312
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:32,610
was going to go but at the very least we

313
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:34,559
understood the dynamic last year that it

314
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,389
was deemed quote too expensive to be

315
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,219
able to provide relief last year by the

316
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,610
chair of this assembly Appropriations

317
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,500
Committee

318
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:44,039
and she's been reappointed so we have

319
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,769
the same sort of potential on road block

320
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,419
but but but gatekeeper to move forward

321
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:53,159
with the tax relief bill this year and

322
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:56,279
hopefully we can coordinate our requests

323
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,439
and coordinate our asks for for relief

324
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,409
for taxes and be able to say that that

325
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,730
listen it's been too unreasonable to

326
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:10,379
follow on

327
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:13,769
well no we shouldn't say that yes to

328
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:16,679
follow so I'd say that's not necessarily

329
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,600
related to the distribution angle per se

330
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,669
that that perpetuates throughout the

331
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,279
supply chain the tax relief issue and

332
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:24,899
then just to sort of round out the

333
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,949
supply chain obviously at the retail

334
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:32,399
level the greatest changes have occurred

335
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:34,320
for the delivery license types you know

336
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,509
that delivery license type remember was

337
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,250
not initially in statute this is another

338
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:41,610
one that was created through the

339
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,929
promulgation of regulatory license it's

340
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,289
created through the regulatory process

341
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:48,359
the rulemaking process even and and what

342
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:50,579
we have now is the ability for dynamic

343
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,379
delivery license models with the ability

344
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:56,550
for an expanded amount of product to be

345
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:58,139
carried around and and most worryingly

346
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:59,909
on the part of some localities that have

347
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,129
chosen a ban we have the ability for

348
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:03,980
delivery services to be able to deliver

349
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:06,509
to places that are quote-unquote ban

350
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,570
jurisdictions how's that gonna work

351
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:11,490
where's the carrot yes carrot will stick

352
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,320
that's that's applied in terms of the

353
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,840
attribution of tax proceeds and

354
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,780
reasonableness right each locality that

355
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,120
doesn't want delivery can impose some

356
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,980
amount of reasonable but heavy-handed

357
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,379
regulation for those that want to

358
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,480
deliver into the cities to do that is

359
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,970
well within the city's ambit of

360
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,340
allowance of control over their

361
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,320
jurisdictions now that's not blocking or

362
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,570
prohibiting and there may be some cases

363
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,280
that come out from this where on the

364
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,640
continuum does that follow of your

365
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,529
reasonable regulation of making people

366
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,870
identify themselves ensuring that you're

367
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:47,639
collecting taxes there's a lot of

368
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,560
different ways to skin a cat if that

369
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,090
saying goes and so you're gonna see

370
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,759
these cities try to exert as much

371
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,820
control as they can because they were

372
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,159
promised dual parallel licensing true

373
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,190
ability and so we're sort of chipping

374
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:04,919
away at that and it's yet to be seen at

375
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,900
what watershed moment the localities are

376
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,209
going to come in and really start to

377
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:12,750
exert themselves and this is going to be

378
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,209
an aspect of how well the retailer's and

379
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,799
the non

380
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:20,308
retailers respect this process and

381
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:22,899
assured that they're providing safe

382
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:26,019
vehicles that they're adhering to the

383
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:30,399
new requirements that you cannot use any

384
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:37,389
form of your car to secure product right

385
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:41,078
and igloo coolers the regulations man

386
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:43,329
yeah timing yeah can be quite difficult

387
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:43,989
speaking of which I think we are out of

388
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:46,719
time

389
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,600
oh we feel yes we're out all right so

390
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,339
come and hang out with us again

391
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,829
preferably I guess on the 15th everybody

392
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:55,839
bobbing away yeah and come and we'll

393
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:59,229
talk about more fun issues like homogeny

394
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,480
and the 10% variance that I is going to

395
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,670
be a big vexing issue in the industry

396
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:13,609
not everybody works really

397
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:13,608
