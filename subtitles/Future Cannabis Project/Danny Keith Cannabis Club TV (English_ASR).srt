1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:12,690
[Music]

2
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:14,968
how many was Danny Keith I'm the CEO and

3
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:17,028
founder of cannabis club TV we ran in

4
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:19,528
dispensary television network with

5
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:21,480
hundreds of hours of content and which

6
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,149
one of them is the Bova de channel which

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,679
is well received yeah yeah which is dope

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,848
I mean for you guys to do that for us

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,710
definitely appreciate it would you get

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,210
the feedback no you were talking about a

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,700
little bit earlier with a gentleman we

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,230
ran into because he had asked us you

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,520
know who's your core audience and we

14
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:38,759
talked about you know very much the

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,030
producers the cultivators the rest of

16
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:47,878
them but that's one thing hey it's

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:49,620
lifestyle bro it's a lifestyle thing so

18
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:50,820
yeah so we're we're talking in is

19
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,530
interesting because you're the first to

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,738
pitch up you're like yeah you know while

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,230
a better part of overdose customer is

22
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:59,968
the producer is the the grower you're

23
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,709
like those guys come into the store and

24
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,000
then you have the distributors coming in

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,618
this store you have the bud tenders in

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,930
this store so I think you made an

27
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,489
excellent point of although your your

28
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,750
system your TVs are on the front line

29
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:11,670
for like better term you're in the

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,680
dispensaries that doesn't mean only

31
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,420
consumers are seeing the message right

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,189
no you know absolutely one of the things

33
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,329
that we did you know prior to really

34
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:22,859
scaling was understand the atmosphere

35
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:24,269
maybe talk to the dispensary owner ask

36
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,969
them what they have going on and just

37
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,530
hang out and it's surprising that you

38
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,908
know a lot of dispensaries are getting

39
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,210
between three and five hundred people a

40
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,040
day on and that's customers right I've

41
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,839
I've hung out in dispensaries all day

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,509
doing installs and whatnot there's

43
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,280
probably another hundred 150 industry

44
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,719
people coming through but just

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,368
constantly people don't understand this

46
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,728
revolving door be that new industry

47
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:49,618
where you have the vendors and and the

48
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:50,759
local reps and all that just coming

49
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:51,959
through and coming through and coming

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,459
through right and I think we talked a

51
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,559
little bit to like in this day and age

52
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,390
especially if you're not using video

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,340
driven content to tell your story

54
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,959
are you really losing out even if it's

55
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,390
only living on your YouTube channel or

56
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,938
you know wherever it may be it's like

57
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,310
you know that the message is just well

58
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:09,269
consumed with video and you know it

59
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,098
didn't take a lot of twisting your arm

60
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,840
to see for you guys to do a channel

61
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,829
because I think you saw the opportunity

62
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,569
to

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,910
to have another set of exposure that

64
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,769
maybe you wouldn't get otherwise like a

65
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,169
lot of people see the packs in the in

66
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,670
people's product and they that's where

67
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:24,929
it stops they don't really go any

68
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:26,609
further but if they are sitting there

69
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,069
watching and also they put two and two

70
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,170
together you start becoming a favorite

71
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,759
of theirs because now the sudden you're

72
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:35,669
helping their product stay fresh longer

73
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,469
and be you know more enjoyable if you

74
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:39,780
will exactly and that's the thing too we

75
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,120
hear from consumers which is surprise we

76
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,129
do some shows where it's b2b and b2c and

77
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,960
a lot of those consumers they'll say

78
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,430
yeah I got this product when I bought

79
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,260
top shelf from fill-in-the-blank

80
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,000
dispensary sure I actually took it out

81
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,829
of that because I went through the

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,840
product but the pack was still good and

83
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,040
I put it in my stash jar but now I need

84
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,170
to get more than so you're I mean it's a

85
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,810
great great opportunity for well I knew

86
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:03,239
you guys were winning in the b2c field

87
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,550
when you I was nice enough to get a

88
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,530
little care package from you and I

89
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,939
brought one home to my wife and she's

90
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,039
like oh yeah I already use those things

91
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,300
I'd peel them out of the stuff I get

92
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,250
back from the dispensary that's like Oh

93
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,340
fair enough so there is a little bit of

94
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,409
that self-induced education with your

95
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,680
product but I think that you know you

96
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:24,680
guys are a critical component and to you

97
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,450
know extending the lifespan of

98
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,520
specifically flower obviously you know

99
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:32,669
before the consumer buys it which is

100
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,230
like an unwritten or unknown factor and

101
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:35,549
I think that that because you've you

102
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:38,519
doing the content because of you guys

103
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:41,010
doing podcast like this it helps the

104
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,810
customer understand where your role is

105
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,519
and that's it that's again I mean I'm

106
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,140
I'm fluffing you up right now but I

107
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,420
appreciate that's what we want to do we

108
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,129
want to help you know our whole premise

109
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,708
for our company is to help educate the

110
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,359
consumer not just on flower but on

111
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,800
testing on I think the guy we were

112
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,720
talking to was a lab you know and it's

113
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,189
like yeah you know other brands go

114
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,989
through other brands are not happy with

115
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:03,150
their labs they see your ad all of a

116
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,189
sudden they're like oh you know so we

117
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,379
try to offer a well-rounded not just the

118
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:10,199
brand specific side but we try to get in

119
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,750
the b2b stuff as well nice very cool so

120
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,339
you uh if you can share I'm sure not all

121
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,930
this public information we always were

122
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,069
under four NDA so we would have those

123
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,069
kind of conversations but

124
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,389
smile you're on camera so yeah so you

125
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,250
know we tell us what you can share about

126
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:29,050
some of these new opportunities and new

127
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,540
partnerships you have going on this yeah

128
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,449
absolutely I think you know what we're

129
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,780
doing right now is applicable to other

130
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,339
verticals and other opportunities so in

131
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:41,259
addition to you know more and more

132
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:43,839
people especially in the cannabis space

133
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,789
are producing content so we're a really

134
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,609
attractive nuisance for them to be able

135
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,439
to get that automatic exposure I mean

136
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,300
just just for the record on content

137
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,579
providers they have an opportunity to

138
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,079
monetize in line so by the time we get

139
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:57,849
the content from them they're already

140
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,699
monetizing we're gonna be able to

141
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,280
guarantee them those impressions you

142
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:05,229
know we started becoming asked we

143
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,059
started expanding our categorical search

144
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,280
right you're you're a fringe one right

145
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,780
because not only you're a b2b but you're

146
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,689
kind of more on the flower side of

147
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:15,519
things like defamation and so when

148
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:17,339
there's like definite ends and

149
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,620
beginnings in the cannabis space on

150
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:22,659
where the people are able to market but

151
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,949
then there's the other area that they

152
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,350
don't know and that's that's where we

153
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,360
saw the need in hydro to kind of have a

154
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,730
space where we can help tell that story

155
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,129
inside those stores they're a critical

156
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,310
component of the process of growing and

157
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:37,870
everything so we launched harvest TV we

158
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,589
did that in partnership with Green Bros

159
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:44,319
we're building nice six foot tall

160
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:45,129
stainless encase stands so the TV's

161
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,509
right in your face

162
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,279
while hydro stores move their stuff

163
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:53,620
around a lot they do they don't

164
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:55,599
necessarily have walls sure you're on

165
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,090
camera buddy we're in the field people

166
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,030
we are live in the field this is not a

167
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:04,419
stage problem these are real dumb people

168
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:06,219
just do impromptu you know cue cards so

169
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,620
harvest TV is an exciting thing we

170
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,810
launched with grow gin first so we got

171
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,879
there 19 stores across 14 states

172
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,069
Congrats oh I appreciate that

173
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,290
and we're learning that space now a

174
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:18,819
different set of clientele and we're

175
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,930
gonna be launching in the early part of

176
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:25,870
March headshop TV so we also see a

177
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,459
crossover right and it kind of just goes

178
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,530
in line with everything that we try to

179
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:31,269
you know when I look at the way I

180
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:33,609
operate as a businessman is I first

181
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:34,120
unidentified a problem then I say okay

182
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,310
well can

183
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,470
I manufacture a solution and then can I

184
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,290
is there a monetizable component to that

185
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,060
solution and then is it really provide a

186
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:45,520
healthy return for the people that get

187
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,350
involved and you know we sew on our site

188
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,109
we have a marketplace we sell

189
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,210
accessories that like grinders and dab

190
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,069
rigs and yeah for companies that are

191
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:56,409
advertising lists I can't do ecommerce

192
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:57,819
and they're not really in headshot are

193
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,979
they're not really in cannabis stores so

194
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,589
they've been asking us to go into head

195
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:04,509
shop so that you can have that immediate

196
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:06,549
traction so we'll be fully in three

197
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:09,219
different categories by the first part

198
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,300
of q2 and then um you know we got some

199
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,550
exciting things going on with

200
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,810
grasshopper kiosks oh no we're gonna be

201
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,550
putting the TVs on top of the

202
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,379
grasshopper again right they are from

203
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,350
the bay they're in Hayward I believe or

204
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:22,870
Oakland and so we're gonna be the TVs on

205
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,580
top of those kiosks little different

206
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,560
model like you know we've got to be a

207
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,620
little bit more specific to the vending

208
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,089
machine component but that's gonna roll

209
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,399
out it's already in market right now

210
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:35,679
we're doing a beta and it looks really

211
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,199
well-received and then we're gonna be

212
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,168
doing mobile plays like mobile tours and

213
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,360
buses and we have a deal brewing with

214
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:44,889
the uber and lyft television company

215
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,780
that's going to be broadcasting content

216
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:49,300
into oberon lifts so we're taking the

217
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:51,339
same thing that we did in cannabis and

218
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,860
we're just replicating it across other

219
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:58,119
alternative markets and we've got a

220
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,788
great library of content and a really

221
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,439
eager consumer of that content and a

222
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:04,569
marketplace that needs a brand to that

223
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,069
consumer whatever so keep it simple yeah

224
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,370
it sounds complicated just keep it

225
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,019
simple

226
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,579
no and I like the fact that you are kind

227
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,779
of looking everything from channels both

228
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:13,569
literally and metaphorically speaking

229
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:15,698
like who are these audiences and and as

230
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:17,110
a company that needs to advertise you

231
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,120
know we're proud to be the Alpha we're

232
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,610
proud to be the leader but just like

233
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,019
coca-cola sponsoring FIFA you no matter

234
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,879
what position you're at you always have

235
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:28,029
to promote well there's a lot of fake

236
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,288
news out there yeah a lot of times

237
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:31,329
people are telling things that aren't

238
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:32,319
true about your brand and even if you're

239
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:34,509
the leader you got to straighten that

240
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,919
out yeah 100% and it's nice to hear that

241
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:37,418
you're targeting our audiences though

242
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,309
because we are recognizing to your point

243
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:41,259
hydro I mean head shops

244
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,639
that's another I'm really surprised head

245
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:44,708
shop smoke shops have had a different

246
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,419
angle since the whole cannabis and you

247
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,649
think III kind of thought and I know

248
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,979
you've been in the space for a minute

249
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:50,049
too

250
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:54,430
I think we all kind of thought that that

251
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:58,629
dispensaries would just organically sell

252
00:08:54,429 --> 00:09:00,699
a ton of consumption devices and I think

253
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:03,460
the regulations made it a little bit

254
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,990
interesting by state like Washington you

255
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,250
cannot you cannot sell except the one

256
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,529
thing you can sell in your dispensary

257
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,570
are cannabis brought right and I think

258
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:12,549
also like just the overwhelming

259
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,200
inventory levels that cannabis stores

260
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:16,659
had too so that kind of left head shops

261
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,480
off to the side I think we're gonna see

262
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:21,309
2019 and 2020 be the year the head shop

263
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,360
yeah you know he's still you get the

264
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:23,799
supplies just talking to a gentleman

265
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,740
from Canada that's what he say he's like

266
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,179
you know I I go to my local dispensary

267
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,590
they have the oil tanks and they have

268
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:31,149
the flour that he's like they don't have

269
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,680
grinder aside to buy a grinder wise here

270
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:34,029
in the Bay Area I had to buy papers

271
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,769
while he's here in the Bay Area I'm like

272
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:37,569
really I mean that's you would think

273
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:39,100
you'd get the tools to do the job it's

274
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,080
been my advice people that say they want

275
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,360
to get into cannabis lately on a retail

276
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,190
level I just tell him open ahead shop

277
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,230
and they're like why would I do that I'm

278
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,030
like well there's no regulation you just

279
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,409
need a business permit and a landlord

280
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,879
that'll let you do it yeah there's not

281
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:53,139
the litany of other things that has to

282
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,210
take place like I wouldn't even do

283
00:09:53,139 --> 00:10:00,970
tobacco I would just do and then just

284
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:03,490
become the premier place to smoke yeah

285
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,440
exactly true so I agree it's gonna well

286
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,879
with that let me ask you know what other

287
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,160
trend both of us being based out of

288
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,659
California which is in an interesting

289
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,610
space right now we'll just say we new

290
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:14,019
2018 was going to be a transitional year

291
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,029
but the permanent regs didn't even

292
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:18,159
permanent permanent regs didn't even

293
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:21,009
come out until last month what what do

294
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,600
you think for 2019 and 2020 do you think

295
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:24,819
the the market is going to continue to

296
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,340
mature not just California but

297
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,260
domestically and finally kind of take

298
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,080
that next step it needs to for success

299
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:33,819
well so everything I do is based on

300
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,930
numbers like people can have a

301
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,250
perception or try to sell a perception

302
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,599
when I have discussions with people it's

303
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,720
about what are the results what are the

304
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,779
numbers I think we've seen that the

305
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,860
state's intent to regulate has

306
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:51,370
manufactured a bigger gray in black

307
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,990
market now so you know it's manufactured

308
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,060
a bigger gray and black market which

309
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,519
they have to basically dial in and so

310
00:10:55,059 --> 00:11:00,219
the state has to the state has to

311
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,899
realize that they need to do this or

312
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,560
that one over yeah it's okay it's

313
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:08,860
I think the regulations are gonna be

314
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:10,659
modified I think you know there's and

315
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,430
they would be you know look anytime you

316
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:14,139
go in and regulate an unregulated market

317
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:16,209
that's been on its own for multiple

318
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:18,069
decades you're gonna have a snapback

319
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,050
right so everybody's like in this shock

320
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,670
and awe that oh my gosh we got this

321
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:23,588
black market so in California it's but

322
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:26,229
it's recreational I don't understand

323
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,870
well it's the first round of regulations

324
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,490
so I think what you're gonna see is you

325
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,710
know we already see I have a couple

326
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,419
concepts one I think the states got to

327
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,509
kind of level out or calibrate their

328
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:39,969
taxation and and ease up a little bit so

329
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:41,769
that less people are enticed to go black

330
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,278
market that's number one easier said

331
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,009
than done

332
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:47,490
number two you know the commodity

333
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:51,730
component of cannabis is is a really

334
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,620
sometimes up and down up and down right

335
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,509
and so I think the stability of price

336
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,450
which I think is going to come from

337
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:59,350
organizations working together and I

338
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,180
think so

339
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,730
so the stabilization of cannabis so that

340
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,139
there can be money made from good people

341
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,730
would be helpful because sometimes

342
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:08,679
people really win and sometimes people

343
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,440
really lose and then I think the final

344
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,149
component is you know to stop letting

345
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,330
the consumer drive the dispensary

346
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:18,850
pricing and let the dispensary and the

347
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,920
brand's just determine the pricing yeah

348
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,960
that then the consumers will consume

349
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:26,949
because for everybody to think that they

350
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:30,910
can get you know the top-shelf cannabis

351
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:35,920
for 45 bucks plus tax you know I just II

352
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:38,559
I - man if I could get like 45 bucks

353
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,659
level I'm in you know so we got to do

354
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,939
some price adjustments on the market but

355
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:45,189
nonetheless it's an exciting time it's

356
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,589
not for the faint of heart

357
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,080
it takes a lot of eating bowls of shit

358
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:52,330
you know to basically get here and I

359
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,560
don't make money is always a driving

360
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,209
agent I think you have to look at what

361
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:57,159
your process is and then you you work on

362
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,479
your variables within there I work with

363
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,389
a couple brands I mean I work with

364
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,039
Tommy's brand Chung's choice even though

365
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:05,019
he's an influencer it's not easy you

366
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,169
know we still have all the same market

367
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:10,059
pressures so you guys do Willie's yeah I

368
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:11,740
talk to those guys they have challenges

369
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:13,449
I mean it's just market pressures that

370
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,269
are not predictable

371
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,440
that don't exist another business so

372
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:19,889
it's the cube thing the five times so

373
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,280
I'm 25 yeah very that's my two cents

374
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,919
awesome man

375
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,750
well what else anything that you know as

376
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,149
far as industry trends that you're

377
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,639
noticing you you're obviously touching

378
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:32,379
on brands and definitely good to hear

379
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,090
that some of these brands seem to be

380
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:37,570
maturing and coming into fruition but

381
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,759
what what is your take on you know kind

382
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,640
of trending as far as bigger brands

383
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,970
smaller brands what I have to say I'm

384
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,620
really excited about the the data that's

385
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,060
coming out like people embracing data

386
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,470
you know people were afraid of that at

387
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:54,369
first you know you had BDS you had

388
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:56,470
headset people are starting to pay

389
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,750
attention to the data you know we all

390
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,029
you know we all think what we know when

391
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,340
we want to sell to a consumer but if you

392
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:04,779
just listen to the consumer you tend to

393
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,300
do a little better that doesn't mean you

394
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:09,669
put all your eggs in one basket and

395
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:11,620
headsets reports for the last quarter

396
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:14,709
coming into the first quarter sativa

397
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,909
gummies are like the top-selling item

398
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,519
right so what do you think you're seeing

399
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:21,699
it's the Jiva gummies yeah okay so it

400
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,199
listen data's important but like also

401
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,480
use a little common sense look for the

402
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,430
sleeper don't just jump on the hot one

403
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,350
cuz the hot ones gonna be passing by the

404
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,059
time you know it's hot yeah it's already

405
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,950
gone and that's a we saw you know engine

406
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:34,809
I always pointed out huge fan of

407
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,670
sweetgrass kitchen shout out to Julie

408
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:38,679
and Jesse out in Colorado they're a

409
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:42,629
little bit more of a boutique compared

410
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:45,219
to wanna brands rahiba or Dixie but

411
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:47,860
they've been very even keel in their

412
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,600
growth very successful they came out

413
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,210
with micro dose they came out with these

414
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,389
little 2.5 milligram it was like

415
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:57,850
lozenges these little chews back in 20

416
00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:01,240
before they were making you micros 15

417
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,680
yeah seriously like everyone was like oh

418
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,720
ten milligrams that's it well we'll do

419
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,429
as much as we can and so that was the

420
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,259
thing that they were going against or

421
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:10,239
like everyone's race to the top but as

422
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,370
much in as possible we don't want to do

423
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,200
that quite contrary we want to cater to

424
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,789
the mainstream that's coming on all the

425
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,620
know your market routine you know and I

426
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,929
mean know your niche yeah and then just

427
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,759
own that niche exactly true and that's

428
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:22,919
the news they came into and I even our

429
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,049
the Epiphany grown up

430
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,939
like you did I'm out there in Colorado

431
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,049
I'm like gosh all the people that used

432
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,519
to consume him and get it from black

433
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,838
marketer and come over to legal no those

434
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,669
people already had their plugs there he

435
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,649
had their outlet it was a mainstream

436
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:36,958
guys and gals are coming in and they

437
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:39,659
didn't want this crazy race to the top

438
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,028
THC of 30 35 percent renewables and it

439
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:43,110
scares them it does yeah because they're

440
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:45,809
thinking they can consume what they

441
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:48,870
consume back in the 60s and 70s you and

442
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:50,698
I the 80s and 90s and that was a

443
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,259
fraction I mean even just in the last

444
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:54,990
seven years they're saying that the

445
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:57,088
potency has gone up 4x so it's like you

446
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,220
think about that now go back 20 years 30

447
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,839
years what's been the multiplier so I

448
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,639
think the micro dose in your point those

449
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,019
companies are like not just industry

450
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,570
trends but figure out what the next

451
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,578
thing is the next and I think you know

452
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,560
for example so sativa gummies is hot but

453
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:13,708
you know flower is always gonna be at 25

454
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:16,948
to 35 percent of the market right and I

455
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:20,009
think you know people have long since

456
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:22,979
gone off of THC value and indica sativa

457
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:25,769
hybrid and they're all high just for the

458
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:31,528
record 90% are couple land racers out

459
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:33,720
there but most your turbines are still

460
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:35,698
some up here but um you know I think

461
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,160
we're seeing an evolution of the plant

462
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:40,169
to you know I was fortunate enough to to

463
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,360
speak with some doctors at UCLA who are

464
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:44,129
really not just synthesizing and

465
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,409
bastardizing the plant but really taking

466
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:48,000
it apart and understanding how many

467
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,139
components are within the plant and I

468
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,870
think we're gonna learn a lot this year

469
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,179
about how terpenes influenced us oh yeah

470
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,820
the combination of th TV with terpenes

471
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:59,429
and a CBD what does that do for you I

472
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,839
grew entourage effect that is to your

473
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:03,958
point yeah like what you're talking

474
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,730
about and I talked to a doctor during my

475
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,379
time at wheat Maps that she brought up

476
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,660
she's like we haven't to vulture put it

477
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,220
out there but terpenes a hundred percent

478
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,339
enhanced the hive you know when we were

479
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,350
smoking weed before we knew yeah and

480
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:18,149
someone say oh this is the OG or this is

481
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:20,578
the Blue Dream we would we would

482
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,900
organically gravitate towards the ones

483
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:23,789
that didn't make us feel like we were a

484
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,500
total I don't know I smoked sometimes

485
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:27,720
and I'm like I started contemplating in

486
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,298
my head too much I'm thinking man I'm a

487
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,519
horrible versus things I think if people

488
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:34,019
knew you know everybody the case and

489
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,548
then you smoked something like I want to

490
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,389
clean the house right now so it's like

491
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:38,339
we organic

492
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,970
we kind of gravitated towards what we

493
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:44,789
want I think as we go forward now you

494
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,339
know I'm a big fan of CBG and CBN I'm

495
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:49,200
CBA yeah you know CB G's like the most

496
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:51,659
the best sleeping agent you can have out

497
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,549
there and same with CBN I think we're

498
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,060
just gonna as we continue to learn it's

499
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:58,889
our job you know to continue to educate

500
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:01,349
the undereducated I mean we know that

501
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,060
there's X amount of people that are

502
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:05,099
coming on new as customers

503
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,419
that's why sativa gummies are blowing up

504
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:08,399
you know they're not blowing up on the

505
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,160
weed head guy the we dead guys not going

506
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,110
in and buying sativa gummies you know so

507
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,630
it's it's one of those things where you

508
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:18,029
know I think I think we've got a long

509
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:21,030
ways to go and it's gonna be an exciting

510
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:24,000
ride man because as it will allow new

511
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:25,649
things to begin to emerge we started

512
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,720
hearing about terpenes about a year a

513
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,970
little over a year ago I don't think

514
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,400
people fully comprehend that yet and I

515
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,990
think the next winners and flowers so

516
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,310
you're gonna look at like I would say

517
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,380
flowers always gonna have a horse in the

518
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,089
race but you're gonna you're gonna see

519
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,840
like Oh babes going off oh my god now

520
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:44,759
this I mean right now still if you look

521
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,619
at PDS or headset fifty fifty-one

522
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,599
percent approximately half of all

523
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:50,039
products sold in dispensaries that they

524
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,379
track are flower

525
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,079
yeah cone three rose projecting like by

526
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,590
two as early as 2020 maybe later on to

527
00:18:55,079 --> 00:19:00,569
2022 that it's gonna be 30 35 percent

528
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:02,339
gosh I you know I heard of it's gonna be

529
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:04,859
flowered the statistics guy in my head

530
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,089
says you're right but then the cannabis

531
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:08,459
guy that's been living in this space

532
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:10,919
says I don't know if I can back that I

533
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,180
don't know I don't know I Morris I've

534
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,880
always been an advocate on the medical

535
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,160
side but I'm a dryer bait because I know

536
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,170
it's healthier and more reliable than

537
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,060
oil I mean especially the the verdicts

538
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,250
still out I mean the only oil is I ever

539
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,379
consumer from companies and in pole or

540
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,779
name definitely know yep that their

541
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,490
component and their contents are good

542
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:31,740
you know really reintroducing natural

543
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,859
Terps not food great Terps like PE g or

544
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,960
PPG fragrance or nut oil or all of its

545
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:38,369
like you just don't know and i think in

546
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,130
the coming years we'll see that maybe

547
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:42,719
oil isn't the most a time people I'm

548
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,440
hearing people are gonna straight just

549
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,759
smoke turps

550
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,190
that's what I'm hearing down the road

551
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,140
it's like and show us herbs right and

552
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,558
it's like and if you find a Terp that

553
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,538
really activates for you and

554
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,628
again that's look we don't have this

555
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:57,099
like yes we have a dozen or thousands of

556
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,138
different beers but they all kind of

557
00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:01,298
have the same end result whereas like

558
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:02,918
we're the plant we're just getting

559
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:04,450
started to understand and then don't

560
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,340
even let's not even that's another show

561
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,340
to talk about hemp and that whole

562
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:11,709
component but it's exciting times to you

563
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:13,178
know to see people out of the closet you

564
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,590
know I have meetings every week with

565
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,600
people that when I first came out of the

566
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,829
closet we're like you're crazy you're

567
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,048
never gonna get another job you just

568
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:22,329
ruined your career and now they're now

569
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:23,618
they're asking me for advice and hitting

570
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:25,990
me up on LinkedIn you know and I just

571
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:27,788
send in my uh I just send in my vin mow

572
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,169
account and I just say here's what send

573
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:31,269
me five hundred bucks and we can talk

574
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:34,600
for an hour you know but we've learned

575
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:36,069
some crazy stuff by hard knocks no it's

576
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,418
very true when I parted ways with the

577
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,278
cannabis the same thing I had friends

578
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:41,080
especially in digital media and calm I'm

579
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:43,148
like well at least you can still say you

580
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,648
worked for digital first media and you

581
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:45,969
can segue back into this and and I'm

582
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:48,128
like I don't know I have a feeling in

583
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,169
man within the first 48 hours having

584
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:51,339
folks like weed maps in high times a

585
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:54,070
medicine man reach out to me I'm like

586
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:55,918
obviously this is my calling I mean look

587
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:57,849
there's no shortage of opportunities

588
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,249
there's a little bit of a shortage of

589
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:03,368
intelligence in some places but you know

590
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:05,019
I think you know listen that's the

591
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:06,970
reason why we're pioneers if you will

592
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:08,349
like a risk takers or entrepreneurs or

593
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,629
whatever you want to classify it's like

594
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:12,969
we have a vision we see it we take the

595
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:15,009
risk sometimes it has a reward most

596
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,509
often the nod has a reward but we go

597
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,970
into that knowing that there may not be

598
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:21,220
a reward and that's not just not for the

599
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,538
most people I mean you know when people

600
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,710
ask me about getting into cannabis we

601
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:26,019
had this talk to it's like well what do

602
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,278
you do already you know and so I think

603
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:30,460
this who you're probably bring it to is

604
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:32,470
that we need we talk we need doctors we

605
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,480
need logistics we need a charge we need

606
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,940
real trade show people not just promo

607
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,980
people we need real people that can make

608
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,528
sales that understand the sales process

609
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,720
and we need people that can slow it down

610
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:45,398
and do the right deals not the deal

611
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,528
right now and then we need some

612
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:49,959
cohesiveness amongst certain players in

613
00:21:47,528 --> 00:21:51,009
the market dispensaries Long Beach I'm

614
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,139
gonna give a shout out to those guys

615
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:55,149
they have the LBC a that they're a very

616
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:56,888
organised group of people they don't let

617
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,719
the brand's push them around they don't

618
00:21:56,888 --> 00:22:00,969
let the legal people push them around

619
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,269
they've protected themselves and they've

620
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,700
done that through an organization some

621
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:08,309
time's frenetic but agreed to process

622
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,920
right and so by do I think we have to

623
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:13,139
start to see those things too to really

624
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,430
continue to mature the place because

625
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,620
there's always gonna be people that try

626
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,630
to do a speedy Gonzalez around the end

627
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:20,339
and make a bunch of money real quick

628
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:22,980
but those opportunities are gonna start

629
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,569
to go away and you know look some people

630
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,509
are gonna make it and some people aren't

631
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:29,279
and some people are gonna morph I think

632
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:30,750
we don't I wish I could tell you what

633
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,829
was gonna happen over the next year

634
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:41,789
you know 2018 felt like since 2000 felt

635
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:43,289
like a five-year year domestic and

636
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:45,180
abroad yeah well cool man it's always

637
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:47,250
good catching up definitely good chat

638
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:50,789
dude I love talking with you it's good I

639
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:58,950
love having a the ability to shine oh

640
00:22:50,789 --> 00:23:00,990
she's a celebrity like yeah you know I

641
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,269
think you know just to end it for me

642
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,759
yeah I appreciate what you do and where

643
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:07,289
you ended up and I know that no matter

644
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,049
where you go that we'll have a

645
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:11,250
friendship and I think that's really the

646
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:13,409
networking component of this space is

647
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,480
really healthy there's definitely people

648
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,580
I don't get along with and don't work

649
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,230
with but the people that I've invested

650
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:21,659
time in and that I have friendships with

651
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,880
they carry over into other areas and I

652
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,519
think that's another thing that might be

653
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,940
impacting 2019 is as as people change

654
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,349
rosters just like the NBA trade the

655
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,000
teams come out different you know and

656
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:34,769
you've brought a lot of you brought a

657
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,059
wealth of information and opportunity to

658
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:38,059
Bovada and I hope they appreciate that

659
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:52,440
thank you take care Thanks
