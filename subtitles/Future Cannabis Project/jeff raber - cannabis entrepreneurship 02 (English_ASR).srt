1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:08,400
[Music]

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,080
now you have this great idea about I

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,960
want to be an entrepreneur and start a

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,439
company and then it's a scientific

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,118
company which requires expensive

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,679
analytical equipment and things that uh

7
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:20,800
like a laboratory fum Hood safety shower

8
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:22,358
and there's definitely a capital need

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,719
I'm going to have to find someone that's

10
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,640
either a high net worth individual all

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,678
of the uh I put a business plan together

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,080
started talking to people and a lot of

13
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:33,159
um professional funders Angel Investors

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:35,119
or investment bankers were like that

15
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:38,878
sounds like a great idea I would never

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,919
touch it like back in 2009 their uh

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,839
their risk appetite or you know

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,280
willingness to enter into this space was

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,000
definitely very different than what we

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,640
hear about today um and still today A

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,679
lot of people are still hesitant but are

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,320
quite curious and I really you know took

23
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,960
a long period of time it was a number of

24
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,280
months with the idea and the plan in

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,759
place and understanding how you could

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,840
get it going um and the first plan I

27
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,320
wrote required a significant amount of

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,400
money and the millions of dollars to go

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
ahead and do it right and all I could

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,560
raise was

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,280
$150,000 so as every good entrepreneur

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,799
will have to do you have to figure out

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,239
how to make do with what you have you

34
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,680
have to be determined and persistent and

35
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,879
if that's my opportunity I'm going to

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,439
make the most of it I'll rework my plan

37
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,118
and figure out how to bootstrap from

38
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,919
there it was the biggest blessing in

39
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,879
disguise I ever got so I didn't outspend

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,118
ourselves we went very carefully slowly

41
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,478
methodically we bought one hlc and got

42
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,680
our you know equipment in the right

43
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:36,000
building a very well suited lab for that

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,479
kind of activity and started working

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,159
really hard from there um and didn't

46
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,280
understand that when we started other

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,320
labs would start with quite a different

48
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,000
model uh in terms of what equipment they

49
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,438
were using what types of costs they

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,239
would charge for their testing that the

51
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,438
market wasn't quite ready for testing

52
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,280
they weren't sure what that really meant

53
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,559
um and you really have to try and and

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,920
continuously Invent Yourself and

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
reinvent yourself just to adapt to the

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,640
conditions and the market Place what's

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,399
out there so I didn't understand

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,478
initially how much education would need

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,639
to be given and how timec consuming and

60
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,719
challenging that really is our first

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,519
choice of analytical equipment was a an

62
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,318
hplc a liquid chromatograph everyone

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
else was using gas chromatographs so

64
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:18,399
people thought that's the only way you

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
can do it why would I want to do

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,800
something different and then when you do

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,360
something different you get more

68
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,519
information but that actually ends up

69
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
being somewhat confusing it doesn't test

70
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,159
for just THC but THC acid which is what

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
the plant makes if I'm making wait a

72
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,400
minute I thought we all were talking

73
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,680
about THC now you're mentioning another

74
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,800
canabo then you say I have to heat it to

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,800
form this one all of a sudden you start

76
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,480
to lose people's uh you know willingness

77
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,719
to try and test or understand what's

78
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,598
really going on it took a long period of

79
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:47,719
time for people to even accept that it

80
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,079
has to be a liquid chromatograph to get

81
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:51,919
started that was the tool that was the

82
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,000
stuff that all of us had thought about

83
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,119
and um my scientific friends and I

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,598
bantered back and forth why do you want

85
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,039
to choose this equipment over the other

86
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,439
ones the other ones are cheaper it's

87
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,560
easier and the assessment at the end was

88
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,280
this is the only tool that can look at

89
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,598
all of the broad-base of products so

90
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,280
every type of product that I'm going to

91
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,959
use this is the one I need to to work on

92
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,680
and it it was half the capital that we

93
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,400
raised was going towards this decision

94
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,719
it was the biggest decision we could

95
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,599
imagine the other decision of not paying

96
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,199
yourself was a little bit easier that's

97
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,359
typically what most entrepreneurs have

98
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,719
to do um years worth of no salary or

99
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,040
working very hard out of the garage they

100
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,519
they often call it um it's hard work

101
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:32,079
dedication many days worth up till 2: in

102
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,840
the morning 3: in the morning to try and

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,799
get the rapid turnaround times we had

104
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,000
promised driving around to collect

105
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,799
samples to make sure they were

106
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,199
scientifically valid and accurate um and

107
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,280
was just fortunate to convince a very

108
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,839
you know very nice and kind friend of a

109
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,680
friend individual to take that risk on

110
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,319
us um that we were going to do whatever

111
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,280
it took to be successful we were going

112
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,679
to do it all right completely

113
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,280
legitimately um above board and really

114
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,760
be standing pillars of scientific

115
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,438
excellence and professionalism and that

116
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,560
took a number of months to convince that

117
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,400
individual and if it wasn't for a

118
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,799
wonderful Christmas gift my father gave

119
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,519
me at the end of that year I probably

120
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,719
wouldn't have had the funds to survive

121
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,519
until um that individual made his

122
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,519
decision and said okay I'll hand over

123
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,160
you know my significant funds to get you

124
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,840
guys started um but fortunately we did

125
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,799
that we got there and it um to every

126
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,799
entrepreneur out there just keep trying

127
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,560
and just don't let don't let anyone tell

128
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,879
you no you just uh if you believe in

129
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,959
yourself and what you're doing and you

130
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,199
know it's right that determination is

131
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,000
what's going to take you through the

132
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,759
really long days the hard pieces of

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,279
effort it is never a get-rich quick type

134
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:39,038
idea it is a labor of love and a lot of

135
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,839
hard work that will get you there it's

136
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:42,159
not this you know oh I have an idea and

137
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,399
tomorrow all of a sudden it's a big

138
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,320
success it's a lot more complicated than

139
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,439
that and I think many entrepreneurs

140
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,120
don't understand that they see this is

141
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:51,719
really good and I can have a lot of

142
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,000
benefits from that but they kind of miss

143
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,280
the part that's all the hard work

144
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,720
towards getting there um and in this

145
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,119
realm with cannabis it's exceptionally

146
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,440
difficult I thought I like a challenge

147
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,879
myself no greater challenge of being an

148
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,519
entrepreneur than this one because

149
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,839
you've got an extra layer of legal

150
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,758
complexity other things that might cause

151
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,239
barriers to entry for others and you

152
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,879
need competitive Advantage if you can

153
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,918
figure it all out before others can

154
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,959
being at the utmost uh responsible level

155
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,519
though and operating transparently

156
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,079
operating to be a very professional and

157
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,478
respected member of the community and

158
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,639
Society in general and doing things that

159
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:30,079
are not you know looked at as favorable

160
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,840
by everyone causes unique challenges too

161
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,519
it's definitely difficult to deal with

162
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,279
everyone in that fashion but that's the

163
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,038
only way that we wanted to operate

164
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,119
raises unique challenges that you didn't

165
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,519
quite think about in your business plan

166
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,918
