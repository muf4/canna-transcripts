1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,139
here in California is there an

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:07,769
acquisition spree in terms of rolling up

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,689
for example retail yeah they're starting

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:10,830
to be I mean you're starting to see

5
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:13,859
players are saying we want to have you

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,690
know 15 20 30 stores which you know you

7
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:16,528
people talked about a couple years ago

8
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:17,820
but there weren't really that many

9
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:20,160
people that are practically speaking

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,750
able to to do that from the standpoint

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,960
of what the the multiples are there

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,359
there is no you know magic formula so

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,890
you take the way California operates

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,390
it's much different than most states you

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,509
have it where it's municipal by

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,239
municipal legislation so for instance in

17
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:38,488
Los Angeles you essentially had the 135

18
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,169
pre ICO retailers that were here that

19
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:41,968
were licensed and then you had you know

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,359
500 other rogue operators that were

21
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,929
spread across the the county now those

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,189
135 should have some sort of insulation

23
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:51,448
attach them in the know the state in the

24
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:53,189
city are certainly making an effort to

25
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:54,750
try to find the rogue operators and shut

26
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,899
them down so if you have one of those

27
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,070
135 those those licenses are valuable

28
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,049
because not only you know do you have

29
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,448
the ability to operate where the state

30
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,859
should grant you your annual license

31
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:07,079
when the annual license is really start

32
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,090
getting doled out in a faster pace but

33
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,459
you also should theoretically have first

34
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,109
bite at the Apple if if Garcetti decides

35
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,849
that he wants to expand the program or

36
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,340
cap packer decides that they want to

37
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,009
expand the program in Los Angeles but

38
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,270
you look at you know a city like San

39
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,650
Diego they've already made their

40
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:24,719
determination on how many they're gonna

41
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,790
give out we don't see any you know

42
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,920
additional legislation coming forward to

43
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,040
expand it so those licenses are a bit

44
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,329
more valuable because it's so finite and

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,030
we don't think there's any you know path

46
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,408
to issue new ones the the big x-factor

47
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,030
right now is what new towns coming to

48
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,000
market you know in San Diego does

49
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,530
Carlsbad or Oceanside or you know Solana

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,269
Beach or Del Mar do they start opening

51
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,219
up and it's become valuable because if

52
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,289
it does then it dilutes the market share

53
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,640
away from the city from you know the the

54
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,290
number of licenses that are already out

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,299
there and the same thing is true you

56
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,590
know in the Bay Area you know we are

57
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,030
some was talking about the conference

58
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,770
today you know the Oakland had such an

59
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,530
advantage for a long time and that

60
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:03,750
advantage is larger yeah and they lost

61
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,239
it yeah it was largely squandered

62
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,859
because they didn't you know move

63
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,639
forward with legislation that was that

64
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,020
was still appealing so when as an

65
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,529
investor or someone that's looking to

66
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,240
buy

67
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,949
asset like that you've got to look at a

68
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,230
the addressable market B you have to

69
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:20,969
look at you know how easy is it going to

70
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:22,079
be to expand that market see you've got

71
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:24,930
to look at who's gonna come in and

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,800
attack that market from the outside do

73
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,849
you need to look at you know how big the

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,380
state market is and can you actually

75
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,519
start selling away from it whether it's

76
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,409
through delivery services or other

77
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,120
things and then you got to weigh all of

78
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:37,229
that so and then you also need to weigh

79
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,150
whether or not the company is profitable

80
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:40,619
in the first place it's easy to say okay

81
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,120
well we're gonna call it like a three

82
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,860
times revenue multiple we're gonna pay

83
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,239
for an asset but if that company is

84
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,530
losing money then you have to decide

85
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,030
whether or not you can actually bring it

86
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,009
to profitability and if there's even a

87
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,150
multiple due to be paid to those

88
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,609
companies or whether it's just better to

89
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,959
let them die and start fresh so you know

90
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,400
what I'm seeing as far as you know kind

91
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,629
of standard metrics on retails is

92
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,010
probably one to one-and-a-half times

93
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,009
revenue on an annual basis
