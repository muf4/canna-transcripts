so I'm Jim fry off I'm a captain with

3
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,019
the Ventura County Sheriff's Office I'm

4
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,919

00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,919
contract city of Oh aye

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,268
so right now we're in the city of Ojai

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,570
we're at a hotel called Casa Ojai Inn

8
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:33,119
that's the the host for the first ever

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,130
weed convention that we've con 2018

10
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:36,479
having never had one in our County

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,700
before we didn't know what to expect so

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,929
I brought additional staffing they were

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,149
expecting anywhere from two to three

14
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:44,009
hundred attendees so I had four extra

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,719
officers that were here but when we had

16
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:47,099
our briefing ahead of time I made it

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,710
clear that our goal is to have a

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,270
successful mellow event where we're

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,829
gonna walk through and be seen whole

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,260
people do that what the conditions are

21
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,270
where there's no usage at the event

22
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:58,799
maker so seen be friendly say hi to

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,699
everybody let them know we're here but

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,839
also cuz I don't want people to be

25
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:02,009
afraid to call us if something goes

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,969
wrong so we're not here to make enemies

27
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:09,840
we're here to hold people accountable

28
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:12,210
and enforce the law that's that's

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,520
correct so the the event that the weed

30
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,929
con 2018 I was contacted by one of my

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,000
dispensaries who let me know about the

32
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,100
event that was gonna happen and the

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,739
promoter sought out a temporary use

34
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:25,500
permit from the city of Ojai to have the

35
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,750
event with the the necessary

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:34,188
restrictions that the city needed a

37
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:36,210
place no I'm good thank you very much

38
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:42,929
thank you for coming up appreciate it

39
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:45,419
what kind of bike you ride it so yeah so

40
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,770
the promoter had to I had to submit to

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,710
get a temporary use permit to have the

42
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:50,700
event and when the promoter came forward

43
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,529
and said hey I want to have an event

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,719
where I want to bring different industry

45
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,968
stakeholders together for a convention

46
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,560
he asked you know this is where I want

47
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,849
to hold it at he knew that we had three

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,340
dispensaries three licensed dispensaries

49
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,169
in the city of Ojai and he went through

50
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,490
the permitting process and was in

51
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,079
secured a permit from the city to have

52
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:08,728
the event obviously there's a

53
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:10,949
substantial amount of conditions on the

54
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,209
on the event itself the most notable is

55
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,259
that no cannabis consumption could take

56
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,330
place at the event

57
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,209
location and that's a and that's not

58
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:24,480
just specific to this event that's a

59
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:26,489
city ordinance prohibition correct

60
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,459
except for in private we see her home

61
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,719
you can use is twenty nineteen gonna be

62
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,878
different than twenty eighteen so the

63
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,709
you know the state keeps changing the

64
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,899
regulations pretty much monthly and as a

65
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,120
result the cities are trying to play

66
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,408
catch-up on what the state's trying to

67
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,629
accomplish and the cities are either

68
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:44,068
trying to be more restrictive than what

69
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:45,959
the state has or at least on par with

70
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:47,789
what the state is doing so as of right

71
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,348
now I think our our conditions are

72
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:51,750
pretty consistent with what the state is

73
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:53,369
doing as far as events like this I it's

74
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,658
my understanding that a state event you

75
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,219
could have it I like a fairgrounds

76
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:58,138
obviously this is not a fairgrounds this

77
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,509
is that this is a hotel that has been

78
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:03,840
rented out for this purpose and because

79
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:06,689
this is a a brand new industry that

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,128
we're all involved in now

81
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,329
people trying to sort their way through

82
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:12,060
it I've see I've been in law enforcement

83
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:14,099
for 28 years and for a majority of that

84
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,378
time marijuana has been illegal and now

85
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:19,439
it's legal with certain parameters and

86
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:20,578
so they keep changing right so and

87
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,009
that's and that's just the way it is

88
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:25,199
right and they'll find some homeostasis

89
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:27,568
at some point of where those laws need

90
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,669
to be to keep people safe and still

91
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:32,429
allow access was what the voters wanted

92
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:35,790
so here in in the city that I think that

93
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,209
we had a ohai had the highest percentage

94
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:41,189
of voters that voted for prop 64 and as

95
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,750
a result their constituents the council

96
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:45,299
members who are working for the voters

97
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,639
decided to move forward with initially

98
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,659
medicinal dispensaries and then several

99
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,699
months later open them up to

100
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,500
recreational or adult use dispensary so

101
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,329
all three of our dispensaries in the

102
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,329
city of Ojai are licensed for adult use

103
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:07,348
voter you know support for prop 64 and

104
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,270
then they ban everything and it's like

105
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:11,340
that's not really the

106
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:13,230
so I think that there's a balance to be

107
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,759
drawn right so you certainly have the

108
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:16,110
will of the people of what they want and

109
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,849
then at the same time when the city is

110
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:20,069
looking at the overall well-being of

111
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,989
their community are they gonna jump too

112
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:23,310
fast do they open up too wide and which

113
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,479
I think was when the city said okay

114
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,160
we're to start with medicinal and see

115
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,450
what that looks like it was probably a

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,650
shorter period of time than I envisioned

117
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,430
but seven months later they've gone

118
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:34,109
adult use or recreational and in that

119
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,750
the transition has not seemed to be an

120
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,670
issue for the city yet but it's still a

121
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,230
very new industry we don't know yet what

122
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,759
the impact is going to be positive or

123
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,990
negative obviously from an industry

124
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,909
standpoint and business standpoint

125
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,170
there's a lot of employers now there's

126
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,660
certainly more employees that are

127
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,250
working up here at the dispensary so

128
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,110
there so there's a value in that right

129
00:04:50,250 --> 00:05:07,079
finding good work for people to be in

130
00:04:52,110 --> 00:05:09,150
that's legal is always good and so as

131
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,859
right now I have met with all three of

132
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:12,899
my dispensary owners I have a great

133
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,400
relationship with all three of them they

134
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,279
also want to make sure the community is

135
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,779
safe so they've given me great access to

136
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,668
all their facilities I actually have

137
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:22,829
access to all the cameras within their

138
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:24,418
facilities they've actually given our

139
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:26,668
that access to our dispatch center so if

140
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:28,109
they ever dial 911 our dispatchers can

141
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:30,000
log into their cameras and see what's

142
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,830
happening live and let the officers know

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,689
that responding in what's happening at

144
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:36,689
the time so from a safety standpoint

145
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,069
it's valuable to have I've asked all the

146
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,478
dispensaries to hand out fliers saying

147
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:41,639
cannabis and driving don't mix and they

148
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,990
have handed out those flyers with every

149
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,939
purchase they have stickers they put on

150
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,769
all their exit bags that say that this

151
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:47,910
is a still a controlled substance to

152
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,728
keep away from people who are pregnant

153
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,400
or minors and pets for obvious reasons

154
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:55,978
and so they they've been been more than

155
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,209
willing to help can control it in a way

156
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:58,560
that makes it safe for our key the

157
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:00,329
safest is it's possible for our

158
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,740
community right so from me and I

159
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:03,389
mentioned to this earlier to you that

160
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,970
I'm not pro marijuana in any regard

161
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,289
right but I am pro law and the law says

162
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,270
that's legal and I'm going to enforce

163
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,129
what is legal right so if it's legal

164
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:12,329
it's legal just like this event the

165
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,399
expectation is that nobody's going to

166
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:15,289
consume

167
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,929
marijuana's product here if they do

168
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:21,080
they'll have to answer to me now are you

169
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:25,100
under any pretense that zero marijuana

170
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:26,569
will be consumed here no no I so I

171
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,270
recognize that there's a good chance

172
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:31,159
that that can happen right I think that

173
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:33,019
the the effort here is to make sure that

174
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,759
the event holder knows what the

175
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:38,060
restrictions are and that he does his

176
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,430
best to control it if they want to have

177
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,449
a second event

178
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:48,530
he'll control it that's the expectation

179
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:49,669
oh yes so so one of the things that I've

180
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:52,519
a relation to one of the dispensaries

181
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:54,918
here locally it's Ojai greens and when I

182
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,149
talk to Matt one of the owners I noticed

183
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:58,009
that he had put a billboard up when they

184
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,659
first went into business along Highway

185
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,819
33 the main corridor into the Ojai

186
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,919
Valley and it said oh hi greens is a

187
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,560
cannabis just proved cannabis dispensary

188
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,060
for medicinal and then he was gonna

189
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,848
change the sign because now that they've

190
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,899
gone true recreational or adult use he

191
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,009
wanted to change the sign and I had

192
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,899
asked him I said hey are you willing to

193
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:16,819
include a public safety message on your

194
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,439
billboard will you include the statement

195
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,019
cannabis and driving don't mix it he

196
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,728
goes absolutely so two days ago the

197
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,198
billboard went up with the message that

198
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:25,759
says cannabis and driving don't mix it's

199
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,280
actually three days it was on Tuesday so

200
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,589
it seems like the majority of your

201
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:33,288
interactions with this community whether

202
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:37,609
it's day-to-day or here at this event

203
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:39,709
have been positive so not contentious

204
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,479
and they're reasonable people so has

205
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,519
that kind of like

206
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:47,899
how have you processed in that

207
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:49,308
experience of like so I would say that

208
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,498
the experience is definitely gone better

209
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:53,088
than I expected right so I think there

210
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:54,800
was a lot of reception right oh yeah

211
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:56,028
okay what's going to happen cuz we see

212
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,348
with the takeover robberies that

213
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:59,120
happened at other dispensaries in other

214
00:07:57,348 --> 00:08:00,579
areas you know what's that going to do

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,139
here are we going to be subject to

216
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:04,968
additional violent crimes in our area

217
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:06,620
because we have a target now that people

218
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:08,538
want to hit and so that's my biggest

219
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,180
concern is they they're a potential

220
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:12,949
target and so by the security additions

221
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,360
that they've that they've imposed that

222
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,189
they've willingly done on themselves

223
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,588
that's helped to reduce their chance of

224
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,718
being harmed or their employees being

225
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:21,889
harmed as well I always wanted to want

226
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:23,088
more right might you know my idea of

227
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,620
security is different than their idea

228
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:25,939
but might just tell them you know hey

229
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,098
this is my position this is what I think

230
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,849
you should do it's it's their choice you

231
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:29,899
know they've met the minimum

232
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:31,759
requirements on what the city has

233
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:32,718
imposed but I just tell them I go hey my

234
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,918
expectation is you're gonna do

235
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,719
everything you can to keep everybody in

236
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:49,818
the community safe and not be a target

237
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:53,120
so I don't want any victims here correct

238
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:54,799
so what we're a bigger city right so

239
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,870
what happens is in California there's

240
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,789
incorporated cities and they can have

241
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,419
their own police departments if they

242
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,039
choose to

243
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,269
obviously the unincorporated areas are

244
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,129
all patrolled by the Sheriff's Office

245
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,209
but incorporated cities can have their

246
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:07,039
own Police Department where they can

247
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,929
choose to contract their services out to

248
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,549
the sheriff's office oftentimes there's

249
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:12,620
a lot of overhead and redundancy within

250
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:14,509
law enforcement from personnel

251
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,818
dispatching SWAT teams all these other

252
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:19,129
things that by contracting with a larger

253
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:21,318
agency they can they could save money

254
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:22,100
they can be more efficient in how they

255
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:24,740
do it now they don't have their own

256
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,209
Police Department they contract with us

257
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,440
so they you know think about we do a

258
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,388
pretty good job of trying to represent

259
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,860
it as we are their police permit so I'm

260
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:32,778
the chief of police for the city of Ohio

261
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:37,459
are the cars that we drive into in the

262
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:39,169
city so we let the council's decide

263
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,149
right it's a it's the council's town

264
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:42,318
they I work for the city manager I'm one

265
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,328
of his department heads just like the

266
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:45,500
many other department heads to make sure

267
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:47,028
we're delivering the service of the city

268
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,470
wants there are all these different

269
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:51,350
constituents right correct

270
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:54,560
you're a stakeholder law enforcement the

271
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:56,899
PTA moms the cannabis consumers that

272
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,989
whatever so are you attending those City

273
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:01,850
Council meetings and it's so kind of

274
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,190
what are the things that you're trying

275
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,560
to push forward and what are things that

276
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:10,280
other stakeholders are pushing forward

277
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:12,469
and how do we come up with how is Ojai

278
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,110
come out with sort of compromises on all

279
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,360
sides okay so the questions on more

280
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,889
venture right so so all the cities have

281
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,629
they're at a different stage of the game

282
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:21,889
right I think city of Ojai is definitely

283
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:24,679
more advanced so the question was how

284
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,850
does the city fare with how do we make

285
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,229
these decisions you know with all the

286
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,300
different stakeholders that are involved

287
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,620
right so yeah police you have parents

288
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:32,029
you have schools you have all these

289
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,100
other constituents who are involved in

290
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:36,289
trying to make up what's right for the

291
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,480
city and most of those redresses are

292
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:39,949
handled at a city council meeting so I

293
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,110
see I attend city council meetings and

294
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,540
if I can't one of my my assistant chief

295
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,639
will attend where those items are

296
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:48,679
discussed about hey this is what they

297
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,120
want to do it's not for me to say right

298
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,469
they can always ask what their what my

299
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,899
concerns are and I share with them what

300
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,040
my concerns are right because it might

301
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:57,379
might these are my concerns I'm

302
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,809
concerned about increase of people that

303
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:00,919
are using illicit substances and driving

304
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:02,209
I'm worried about the security for

305
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,009
people coming in doing robberies because

306
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,690
it's a cash business I'm worried about

307
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:07,309
at least now as of July at least they're

308
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,080
not coming with a 55-gallon drums full

309
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:10,759
of weed because it's all prepackaged

310
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,220
from the manufacturer so there's less of

311
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,139
a target for for the theft of the

312
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,790
marijuana now it's just the cash item

313
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:19,399
but you know all these businesses know

314
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:22,429
that that's a target they have vaults to

315
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,329
hide the cash in to store it in and then

316
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:25,250
they know that when they have a certain

317
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,960
amount to take into deposit at the bank

318
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,460
set they can still do banking with or

319
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,139
they break it apart so that the banks

320
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,889
are not wise to whatever their decisions

321
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:31,819
aren't right they're the ones that have

322
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:34,189
to find out what they're doing with it

323
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,650
until there's a greater resolution on

324
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,120
the banking system for the cannabis

325
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:39,689
dispensaries did you have any

326
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,490
perspective

327
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,829
yeah so all three of our dispensaries

328
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,629
were also given the permit for delivery

329
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:48,370
as well so when the city first stepped

330
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,980
into it they said they would give three

331
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,839
delivery licenses and three dispensary

332
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,850
licenses it just worked out that the

333
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,920
people that qualified for the licenses

334
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,720
we're able to provide both or applied

335
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,328
for and received both the delivery and

336
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,860
the no and then in the dispensary model

337
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:04,208
so yeah I have a concern about them

338
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,289
being robbed but note I have a concern

339
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,059
about the Domino's guy getting robbed

340
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:08,500
too right so I mean anytime you have

341
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,539
product and money and you have people

342
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,809
that you have a potential for for a

343
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:14,889
crime so one of the things that the

344
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,969
dispensaries know is to make sure

345
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:17,409
they're sending out their drivers on

346
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,839
designated routes with not with not a

347
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:21,000
ton of product or a ton of cash they go

348
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,350
out make their round and they come back

349
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,759
currently our delivery drivers in the

350
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,509
city can deliver anywhere in the city

351
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,800
anywhere in the unincorporated area and

352
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:31,720
for the city other cities outside the

353
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,458
jurisdiction they can apply to get

354
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,540
delivery licenses in those cities and if

355
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,369
they're granted license that they can

356
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:37,688
deliver they're in the city of Ojai the

357
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,278
only ones that can deliver in the city

358
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:41,169
of Ohio are our three dispensaries that

359
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,399
we have here nobody from outside now I

360
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:44,289
know that the state is looking at

361
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,000
changing that the state's looking at

362
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:47,349
changing that and I know I don't know if

363
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,458
that what will happen but one see and

364
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,399
that's one of those changes that's still

365
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:53,409
kind of unfolding but for now it's these

366
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,240
three dispensaries and they know what my

367
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:58,620
concerns are and as of right now have

368
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,620
been abiding by those concerns and

369
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,269
they've had it for medicinal they've had

370
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,800
the delivery license I've had one one

371
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:06,240
shot that's been open for a year or

372
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,339
pretty close to it the other two have

373
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,408
been open for about nine months

374
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,408
[Music]

375
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,250
right so it's not a fair comparison but

376
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,980
I will so what's the comparison between

377
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,919
alcohol and marijuana and the drama that

378
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:42,210
it causes within the you know the public

379
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,829
right okay so the issues that are

380
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,810
because marijuana has been illegal up

381
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,040
until just very recently it's not been

382
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:48,899
as mainstream as alcohol which has been

383
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,309
legal for a long time and so certainly I

384
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:55,439
would say that the marijuana the alcohol

385
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:56,579
issues are far more likely than with the

386
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,810
the marijuana like if you were to

387
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,220
compare how many occur so there was one

388
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,109
thousand incidents compared to one

389
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,080
incident of this because one was legal

390
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,580
and one's not the challenge will be now

391
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,290
that it's legal well we see that number

392
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,420
increase based on like you said the

393
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:10,799
fights domestic violence or vehicle

394
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:12,689
crashes and whatnot because the access

395
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,759
is different the active for people that

396
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,320
maybe had access before but were like

397
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,159
more cautious about using it because

398
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,180
they would be they were afraid of

399
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,759
getting arrested now they don't have

400
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,109
that fear anymore what's the what's

401
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,370
what's gonna be the new normal that

402
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,889
we're faced with so I'm curious to see

403
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:29,210
how that how that plays out my homework

404
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:32,309
assignment for you is to when

405
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:35,129
consumption events are finally legal in

406
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:39,000
whether Ventura County Ohio specifically

407
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:41,700
I want you to watch how one of those

408
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,159
events plays out and sort of in your

409
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,640
mind just know that no

410
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:49,009
of bytes you would see at an alcohol

411
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,710
sort of like a concert without all

412
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,659
versus an event like this because I

413
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,940
guarantee you and you'll see all sorts

414
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:59,059
of people just like being nice to each

415
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:01,670
other and having like deep discussions

416
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:03,979
and conversations whereas like then you

417
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,929
go next door to like the Oklahoma party

418
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,519
and it's like you see you stepped on my

419
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:09,799
toe and they like start punching each

420
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,569
other and getting all aggro and so

421
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:15,349
anyway all right all about me my

422
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:17,840
homeworks I try to write so we'll know

423
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,550
within you know as things become more

424
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,200
normalized it's like you know for this

425
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:22,459
event it's the first one of its kind in

426
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,280
Ohio and probably the first one of its

427
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,800
kind in Ventura County not knowing what

428
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,259
to expect this is this is a very relaxed

429
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,269
event I have not seen had any issues at

430
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:34,129
all I see part of the conditions is that

431
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:35,360
we get to walk in you know as often as

432
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:37,789
we want and I've walked through talked

433
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,090
to the different the vendor booths but

434
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:42,709
it's also now I'm not coming in with a

435
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,050
heavy hand in mind either right I'm

436
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,670
coming in trying to make sure that that

437
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:48,109
they know they can still call us right

438
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:49,879
at the end of the day I'm trying to

439
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,899
provide a public service and trying to

440
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,610
keep everybody safe

441
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,750
they know what the restrictions are I

442
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,039
expect that they abide by there's

443
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,019
restrictions there's always gonna be bad

444
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,789
apples that don't and if they're sought

445
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,889
out enforcement action may be taken

446
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:02,120
right but if as long as everybody knows

447
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:05,580
what the expectation is if they can

448
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:23,490
model that expectation we're

449
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:23,490
