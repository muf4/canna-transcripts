1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,509
being around other people who got

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:08,759
addicted to opioids that scared me so

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,219
anytime there was something that was

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,769
going to be prescribed to me for an

5
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:16,618
injury or for pain I just was always

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,679
afraid of taking incense so I really

7
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:21,240
never did anything at all even Advil and

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,920
when you're doing something like mixed

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,049
martial arts and in a lot of ways the

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,529
training is more difficult than the

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,080
fight itself and in the UFC you can kick

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:33,090
you can knee you can elbow you can punch

13
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,599
and you're doing this with 4 ounce

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,030
gloves so you know the training 40 is

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,120
brutal you're training two three times a

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,549
day you're sore all the time you're

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,468
hurting all the time not to mention

18
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,000
you're taking you know some some blows

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,609
to the head even before you even get

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,140
into the cage so it's very much it's

21
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:54,359
very difficult on the body and being

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,679
around the various mixed martial arts

23
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:01,170
gyms kick boxing gyms boxing gyms I saw

24
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:05,280
a lot of nightmare stories of kids and

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,200
men who were addicted to opioids and a

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,570
lot of promising careers were thrown

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,390
away because of it so that definitely

28
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:15,179
had an impact on me and you know it was

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,530
a reoccurring reoccurring theme through

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,630
all the different gyms that I was around

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,780
and a lot of the fighters you know used

32
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,629
them recreationally you know as a party

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,759
drug vicodin and percocet were mixed

34
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:28,640
with alcohol and you know a lot of

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,259
craziness the student because of it and

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,170
you know again I just saw a lot of lives

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,409
shattered because of it and even had a

38
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,780
very negative perception of marijuana as

39
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,880
well coming out really our perspectives

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,390
guide us and in everything that we do

41
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,489
and see and I kind of had that that

42
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,859
negative view of cannabis and really

43
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:54,030
didn't try it until I think I was like

44
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:56,849
28 years old when I was kind of I guess

45
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,420
in the beginning earlier part of my UFC

46
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:03,089
career and it it definitely helped me in

47
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,909
a variety of ways dealing with pain and

48
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,610
I guess seeing things in a different way

49
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,030
and and it didn't have those dictum

50
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,030
qualities
