2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,719
here we are at all the flowers we're

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,660
talking to a famous sunshine Johnson

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:16,230
from southern Humboldt famous dry farm

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,230
cultivator so tell us about your cell

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,660
and tell us about what you're doing

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,789
right now you're here at Hall of flowers

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,199
and you have new packaging so talk to us

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,580
about the process of getting your new

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,050
packaging together well I'm currently

11
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:34,738
very busy getting ready for my harvest

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,509
preparations on the farm and this is I

13
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,609
don't really have a lot of shots to just

14
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:40,589
leave the farm right now there's a lot a

15
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:48,119
lot going on getting ready for harvest

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:51,660
and I came down here to yeah I came down

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:55,288
here to show my packaging and this is it

18
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:57,359
now this is new this is new this is new

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:02,550
I'll be working on this for about nine

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:06,539
months okay so this is sunshine Johnson

21
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:08,158
Sun volt grown loopy fruit and her new

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,630
packaging which is new there's something

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,500
unique about the packaging so why don't

24
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:14,399
you walk us through it

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,030
this is a mason jar canning jar lots of

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,240
different uses this is also probably

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,849
well not for long but currently the

28
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,728
biggest jar on the shelf it's probably

29
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:28,140
even got the biggest buds and can I hold

30
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:34,099
this and you can open it up sure

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:37,710
so it took till legalization to finally

32
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:39,658
vacuum see all my jars very excited

33
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:42,658
about this so when you open it it pops

34
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,759
makes a nice pop down and this is now I

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,740
I don't know what the shelf stability is

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,700
but it definitely helps create shelf

37
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:53,219
stability

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,219
this has got big buds of loopy fruit

39
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,530
yeah yeah there's a package in there and

40
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,938
[Music]

41
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,409
this is what the big butter loopy free

42
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:09,939
looks like this is from the 2018 harvest

43
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,689
the question that people ask when they

44
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:17,139
look at the loopy fruit is is that last

45
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:19,750
year's because my herb is properly dried

46
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:21,669
and cured it actually gets better with

47
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,769
age and I would not want to release it

48
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:26,859
too soon because the one thing that I do

49
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:29,469
on my farm which is pretty it's pretty

50
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,000
common in agriculture to cut early and

51
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:33,969
rush to market and that is something

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,759
that I do not do I let things hang and

53
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:38,919
get ripe and hear the proper amount of

54
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:44,919
time and I don't release it until it's

55
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:48,039
ready so is there an ideal sort of

56
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:50,349
waiting or shelf time for your flower I

57
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:53,590
mean you're saying it actually gets

58
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:57,759
better and this is also vacuum sealed so

59
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,920
it's not going to degrade no and you

60
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,599
want to wait so it's done curing before

61
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,488
you seal it that's a mistake that a lot

62
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,579
of people make so how long is your

63
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:10,209
occurring process the soonest I package

64
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:11,709
will be early February late January

65
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,150
that'd be the earliest I would start and

66
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,750
then I would continue I'd continue

67
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,269
packaging all the way up until May so

68
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,310
your harvesting when I'm harvesting in

69
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:26,230
October and getting about a six month

70
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:28,689
Kieran it that's pretty rare isn't it

71
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:30,459
six-month cure yeah and it could even go

72
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:32,439
longer this actually went a bit longer

73
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:35,019
than I intended but in the creation of

74
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:39,969
the packaging took a long time to get

75
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:40,450
this out but even now people are loving

76
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,969
it

77
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:45,159
there's all they say is is this is last

78
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:47,139
year's and then they're like wow wow

79
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,539
this is really good there's no question

80
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:53,170
about the dollars your process your

81
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:58,180
curing process alone is the complete

82
00:03:53,169 --> 00:04:01,699
opposite of commodification of mass

83
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,099
production at the lowest costs

84
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:07,369
so let's talk about the difference

85
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:09,259
between craft and commodity well a lot

86
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:14,359
of the commodity market is currently

87
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:15,078
being driven by simply for cannabinoids

88
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:17,840
that's it

89
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,418
no terpenes no flood not even any plant

90
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,219
matter just strictly cannabinoids and

91
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:25,370
that's a real drive to the bottom that's

92
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,000
just a bulk product and the flower

93
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:32,720
market is a bit different but even so

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,069
you still find commodity in the flower

95
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,289
market and yeah the commodity market is

96
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:41,709
just a it's a real drive to the bottom

97
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:46,159
and it's also driven on a grading system

98
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:48,258
so as opposed to craft and so what

99
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,509
criteria is brought to bear how is that

100
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:56,810
great well you don't really I mean you

101
00:04:53,509 --> 00:05:01,160
you can grade it but really what you're

102
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:03,759
looking for is you're looking for the

103
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,439
quality standards that produced it and

104
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,069
because the quality standards along the

105
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,959
way are very important because you can

106
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:13,848
choose to cut corners or not cut corners

107
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:18,698
and it really depends on what it is that

108
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:21,500
you're looking for so with with mine I

109
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:25,189
might resonant for instance I will if

110
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,829
you let the plant get ripe you will lose

111
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:30,168
color you your plants won't be as bright

112
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:32,959
green when you cut your resin is going

113
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:35,598
to turn a slight I don't want to say

114
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,370
brown but gold in color it's not white

115
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:40,550
it's not it's not doesn't have that

116
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,069
bright white look to it and and the buds

117
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,960
are not as bright green because you're

118
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:46,759
letting it the plant age a little bit

119
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,750
longer while it's still in the ground

120
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,490
and so if you don't know you might look

121
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,439
at that and if you're just doing a

122
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,750
commodity style grading you're like oh

123
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,629
the colors not right oh the resins not

124
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,629
right and then and so that's part of it

125
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:05,990
and then also just being an outdoor

126
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:08,509
grower my stuff is just hanging out

127
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,360
there it only comes once a year I'm not

128
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,979
under a greenhouse I take a lot of risks

129
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,810
growing in this way

130
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:16,668
and it comes out different I

131
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,259
winburn it's quite windy and in the

132
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:22,039
winburn can cause the buds to be a

133
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:24,409
slight can turn even a bit of an

134
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,850
off-color we're in the wind directions

135
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,860
you can get the bud and you can bike a

136
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,060
little bit too toned and that's just

137
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,889
from the wind and there's there's

138
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,290
nothing wrong with that interesting I

139
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:36,019
didn't even know about wind burn now we

140
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:39,319
should also say that you grow a portion

141
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:41,930
of your harvest for you submit tomato

142
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,050
with nausea to make hashish yes thank

143
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,360
you I do is the curing process or the

144
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,850
process different for that when you're

145
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,060
curing for hash is that different does

146
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:56,570
that go so because the resin so if if

147
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,000
you're curing for flour you still want

148
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:02,990
to produce a lot of resin yes for my

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,329
flower crop I will cut it before the

150
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,199
hash I will let the hash crop go as long

151
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:11,599
as I can and I will harvest the flower

152
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,000
crop a bit just a little bit earlier

153
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,729
than the hash crop but the one thing

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,978
that's important with the hash crop and

155
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:22,490
one of the things that's also unique to

156
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:24,079
Naja is that one of the things that I

157
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,090
like is I like a little bit of plant

158
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,699
matter in my hash and the reason why is

159
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:32,060
because it added it adds complexity it

160
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:35,029
adds texture to the smoke and if it's

161
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,129
well cured if it's well dried it's

162
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:39,259
properly dried and well cured when you

163
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,579
go to smoke the hash made from and

164
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,860
there's some of that plant matter in

165
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:47,149
there it will show itself very well and

166
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:52,280
it adds that complexity wow this really

167
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:55,519
is craftsmanship at its purest and then

168
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:59,449
the idea is to transfer that into the

169
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:03,288
marketplace right and and to receive the

170
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:05,538
appreciation that you're deserved the

171
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:07,788
appreciation yeah I just be true to

172
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:09,439
myself and that's what's important there

173
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:12,589
may be some appreciation here and there

174
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:15,288
it may take time but I don't you know

175
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:16,099
yeah I just I'm just gonna live my life

176
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:20,689
to the fullest

177
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:23,030
very very very chill of you very zen of

178
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:24,889
you so

179
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:26,959
how did you get into the making the hash

180
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,039
tell us that very quickly and is that

181
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,859
important to you and you want to

182
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:35,629
continue doing that yeah the ice water

183
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:38,240
hash is it's its whole plant medicine

184
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:41,840
and it's very powerful medicine it's

185
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,930
really it's just I can't even tell you

186
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:49,340
how many levels it works with people and

187
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:51,559
and I just I I just really want to grow

188
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,259
the best herb that I possibly can to

189
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:56,809
make the best hash because I feel that

190
00:08:54,259 --> 00:09:00,679
it's such an important medicine and it's

191
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:02,119
also one of the most decadent products

192
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,419
you can get out of the cannabis plant

193
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,940
you can literally take the rapists resin

194
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:10,789
heads and hold it in your hand from that

195
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,760
crop like the literal cream edges which

196
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:15,949
is the the full melt that you can get

197
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,299
which is very good medicine too

198
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,220
especially for people who have health

199
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:21,319
issues because it's a vapor at that

200
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,540
point and the plant matter in the hash

201
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,379
may not be appropriate for people who

202
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:29,480
aren't necessarily in the best of health

203
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:32,299
Wow you know the way you describe it you

204
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,820
know I'm a hash lover I can't wait to

205
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:39,009
taste some of it but your process is so

206
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:42,379
long you're gonna probably be like

207
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:45,679
curing your hash product through next

208
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:48,309
May and so the nausea product will

209
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,319
probably come out next July or all

210
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:54,049
depends it depends really on the hash

211
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,190
maker and he can decide that oh okay he

212
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:57,379
can decide that he has some other

213
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,450
parameters that he likes getting me all

214
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,620
mouth water that I got you know how are

215
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,580
we gonna when will we be able to

216
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,100
experience this it's on the Shelf good

217
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,770
you can look for the rebel moon or the

218
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,230
North cow diesel and it's on the shelf

219
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:15,409
it's one of the best value buys out

220
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,539
there and it is I grew the crop just for

221
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:21,919
hash it's all over the state two strains

222
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:23,959
no it's it's just one string and I just

223
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:28,219
did a name changed halfway in there it's

224
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:31,759
just anyway so the rebel moon is out

225
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:34,528
there and it's very it's it's very good

226
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:38,100
I I grew that

227
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:40,679
just just for a hash crop I let it hang

228
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,769
a bit longer and I hope to let it go

229
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,508
even longer this year now as a part of

230
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,249
your you're really busy right you have a

231
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:49,259
lot going on in fact you're not even

232
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:53,370
here right now your brain is somewhere

233
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:54,839
else right that's great so we're getting

234
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,490
rid of the real actually the real truth

235
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,370
out of you you know this is like a truth

236
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,709
serum so you also do a lot of educating

237
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,110
you know you do seminars you do speaking

238
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:07,198
are you gonna continue doing that to get

239
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,839
your unique message of craftsmanship and

240
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:12,958
artistry out there yeah yeah I do I

241
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:16,230
would like to to stay as or I would like

242
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:19,399
to keep doing education and even expand

243
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:22,230
on it would you describe what you do I

244
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,169
mean is it educating are you just

245
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,569
getting a message out what do you do

246
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:30,028
well there has its own message so that's

247
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:34,588
what part of it and just along for the

248
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:37,948
ride in that regard and then yes there

249
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:41,939
is it is an important time to have a

250
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:44,849
message and and even no matter how good

251
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:46,828
my herb is the message can be even more

252
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,139
important let me ask you this do you

253
00:11:46,828 --> 00:11:51,359
have specific messages for specific

254
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:57,299
groups like say if I say do you have a

255
00:11:51,360 --> 00:12:03,100
message for retailers that you they need

256
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:07,899
to understand about cannabis

257
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:10,000
yeah yeah the retailers are I'm not the

258
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:14,769
direction that the retail market is

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,970
taking is it's just downright evil it's

260
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:22,809
really not it's not a good place to be

261
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,730
and part of it is that I really value my

262
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:28,629
my relationships and when I work with

263
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:33,009
someone we work together and what's

264
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:34,539
happening with retailers is that we I

265
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:36,789
mean I knew this was going to happen as

266
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:40,029
a farmer that I was going to carry the

267
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:42,669
entire tax burden so when you go to

268
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:45,069
retailer they want to take half of the

269
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:47,199
half of the profit plus a little more

270
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:51,280
well what's that little mark oh it's

271
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,430
that excise tax the retailers for taking

272
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:58,329
half of the profit I just feel that

273
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:59,919
they're lousy partners and are they

274
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,740
gonna work for me are they gonna work

275
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,240
for that that half and I just kind of

276
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,129
wonder at times now they're talking

277
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,919
about wanting shelf space and if I'm

278
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:10,779
gonna be marketing everything doing all

279
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,949
the packaging all the marketing I might

280
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:14,110
as well just going with a delivery

281
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,750
service really and trying to pass some

282
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,850
savings on to the people that's

283
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,039
interesting you've spoken before about

284
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,590
how you feel like direct-to-consumer is

285
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,599
a port important part of your future do

286
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,149
you still believe so I just want to

287
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,940
return back to the retail aspect because

288
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:34,179
I do have good retail partners out there

289
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,070
and those are independent shops and it's

290
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:38,379
really important that we maintain these

291
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,270
independent shops and so I definitely

292
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:42,580
want to be there to support those

293
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:46,090
retailers that we share similar values

294
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,950
in a similar message app absolutely so

295
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,889
I'm just talking about a general trend

296
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,210
that I see see happening right right no

297
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:55,990
I understand

298
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:58,720
in many ways it's about it's it's a

299
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:01,029
segmented industry and for some people

300
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,070
their values are predominant so they're

301
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:05,860
finding those people to work with who

302
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,530
share their at their values in ethics

303
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,970
that seems to be a theme for certain

304
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:14,198
types of people

305
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:16,479
yeah absolutely yeah and why not you

306
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:20,048
know it's it's a it's a cutthroat

307
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:22,028
industry I mean and it's cutthroat out

308
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:23,588
there so if it's going to be cutthroat

309
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,999
you might as well work with people who

310
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:29,069
share your values so they don't cut

311
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:33,009
through your throat yeah it's been a bit

312
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:36,128
challenging to be a farmer and I knew

313
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:39,668
that so it's like just a quote and

314
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:41,798
Anthony B song everyone wants to raid

315
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:43,778
raid the barn and no one wants to grow

316
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,149
the corn and that's just what it feels

317
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:47,798
like every day

318
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:51,339
interesting well you're sticking to your

319
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:53,499
guns and nothing's going to deter you

320
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,659
you've been doing this a long time your

321
00:14:53,499 --> 00:15:00,339
generational right you come from a

322
00:14:55,658 --> 00:15:04,359
family of growers is this correct your

323
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:06,909
mother grew and my brother is also a

324
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:10,229
permanent licensed farm yes our our

325
00:15:06,908 --> 00:15:13,119

327
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:19,359
all right now you have all the pieces

328
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:23,379
that you need to move forward so what

329
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:29,168
are those pieces well it does take I

330
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:30,999
mean to be to be not just premium but to

331
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:33,220
be ultra premium there's only like four

332
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:35,829
things that you you really need you need

333
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,819
a good backstory which I have you need

334
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:41,649
to show high pioneering and in an early

335
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:45,608
leadership which I have which I am doing

336
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:48,009
and you also need quality and

337
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:49,418
consistency which I spent the past few

338
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:51,459
years I mean I've been growing my whole

339
00:15:49,418 --> 00:15:53,078
life but I really had to work on this

340
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,928
quality and consistency I had to very

341
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:57,668
quickly sophisticate my growing and my

342
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:59,228
drying and caring and take all these

343
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:01,629
years of knowledge that I have and apply

344
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:04,229
it and you got to have quality and

345
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:07,808
consistency the other and then the other

346
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:10,479
part that you need is you need premium

347
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:13,509
packaging and the tricky part about

348
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:16,749
packaging is getting packaging that

349
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:19,298
equally matches your story and I did

350
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:21,100
this myself I mean I worked I worked

351
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:22,588
with people a number of people to help

352
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:27,879
me bring this to

353
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:30,250
but this was my my vision yeah yeah so

354
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:34,778
I'm just very grateful and this was a

355
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:37,690
big part this was very probably one of

356
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:40,809
the more difficult parts is to get that

357
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:43,209
story and put it into a package now your

358
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:45,899
story isn't just you but it also

359
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:48,039
involves your community doesn't it

360
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,149
absolutely and that's a great question

361
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:53,139
and I want to thank you for asking that

362
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:55,328
because when it does make a difference

363
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:58,000
I've talked to other multi-generational

364
00:16:55,328 --> 00:17:01,929
growers from other parts of the state

365
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,419
and it's not the same as when you grow

366
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:06,399
up in a community of growers and that's

367
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:09,610
how I grew up and the sharing of

368
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,189
information and the community that we

369
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:14,259
created around our outlaw culture and

370
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:16,329
our growing was very formative for me

371
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:18,009
well you're not just a member of the

372
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:20,828
community you're an activist member of

373
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:23,230
the community you have a radio show on K

374
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:26,619
mud so you're really in touch with the

375
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:29,919
people in your community right yeah yeah

376
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:33,759
somewhat I mean I yeah I mean I try to

377
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,190
be yeah I mean okay so to the extent

378
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,349
that you are I can't let you go without

379
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,210
you talking about what's the state of

380
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:42,369
southern Humboldt right now of your

381
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,710
brothers and sister cultivators in

382
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:47,979
general can you speak to that a little

383
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,819
bit about you know what's going on yeah

384
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:55,360
it's an exciting time there's been just

385
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:58,418
just with perseverance and some our

386
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:02,109
community values of just doing it

387
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:07,509
ourselves it's it's happening and it's

388
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:09,729
very exciting to see to see us get

389
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:13,329
through this and to see where this is

390
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:16,029
going and it's also been a struggle

391
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:20,470
there's been abatements going out to

392
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:22,960
growers and there's also been you know I

393
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,329
I'm there's parts of the county

394
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,429
government that have been very good to

395
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:31,990
us but there's also still just a little

396
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:34,170
bit of discrimination left over from

397
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:37,410
just all of these years

398
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:39,570
of us being growers and other people

399
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,490
work in their office jobs and maybe them

400
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:42,899
be an envious I don't know or jealous

401
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,809
but like whatever it is we still there's

402
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,870
still a tiny bit of discrimination among

403
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:50,339
for us multi-generational growers but

404
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:52,259
that will change humble County is

405
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:54,329
working on an equity program and we're

406
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:56,009
opening up this discussion and I hope to

407
00:18:54,329 --> 00:19:01,730
see some good changes around that and

408
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:05,879
some healing in our community and also

409
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:08,039
we were we just have such a great

410
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,770
rebellious spirit and I'm really looking

411
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:12,210
forward to seeing us all just we're

412
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:14,789
gonna push back at these market forces

413
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,350
and we're just gonna be ourselves and

414
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:19,829
true to ourselves and true to the plant

415
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:22,139
that's really a really incredible is

416
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:24,419
Appalachian still alive is that still a

417
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,150
plant is that still something that is

418
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:31,080
important to the region yes marketing by

419
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:33,840
region is is one of the best ways to do

420
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:37,019
marketing because it creates this

421
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,449
informal collective and it challenges

422
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:42,629
all of us to compete in a healthy way of

423
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,700
wanting to grow the best because anyone

424
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,860
who's growing something terrible it

425
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,690
hurts all of us so there's this collect

426
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:51,689
as a collective we want to all be

427
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:54,330
growing the best and the highest-quality

428
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,150
and that's the one thing that we have in

429
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:59,909
Humboldt some of our strongest marketing

430
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:02,670
aspects is that we have consistency from

431
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,800
a region and that's really powerful and

432
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,539
I'm just very yeah that's wonder that's

433
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,789
definitely it's one of our biggest

434
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,980
marketing strengths for sure so you know

435
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:15,210
I ask kind bill this and I'm gonna ask

436
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:20,130
you is there is like what will it be

437
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:22,289
that like like the 2020 to harvest like

438
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:25,650
can it will be that was a great year

439
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:31,950
that it's like like a like a wine

440
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:36,210
harvest yeah you know yeah there are

441
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:38,340
some things about the way that growers

442
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,850
like myself who just grow in the full

443
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:44,789
Sun without greenhouses and I am gonna

444
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:50,308
protect some of my more delicate

445
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:52,710
flowers with a with a row crop cover

446
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:54,899
because these rains coming in the fall

447
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,370
are coming down so hard that they can

448
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,620
just beat down your bud and that's

449
00:20:56,369 --> 00:21:00,239
something that you will see different

450
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:02,819
vintages if you want to call them that

451
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,039
where if we have some hard rains those

452
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:07,230
outdoor growers their buds might not be

453
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,019
looking as good and that ripe resin can

454
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,210
get kicked off so that's that's a

455
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,779
concern but one of the things too is

456
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,579
we've been having these cool nights and

457
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:20,069
the sugars that develop from cool nights

458
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:22,079
are just some of the best and so there

459
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:24,569
will be vintages for sure and I feel

460
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,970
that the the hash will capture quite a

461
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:28,769
bit of that is it is it will it like

462
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:32,100
like with wine will it be able to be

463
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:36,808
used marketing wise in the market do you

464
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:38,789
think yeah yeah there will possibly but

465
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:42,210
especially with the hash which can be

466
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:43,829
library Dan aged that actually I mean

467
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,259
and Frenchy always talked about this

468
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:48,329
about how the temple balls really get

469
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:51,150
better with age and the best one he ever

470
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:53,399
had was 15 years old that's amazing and

471
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:56,130
that is some amazing medicine that's

472
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,110
really about power so one could see like

473
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:00,150
with uh with corn yaks and with things

474
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:02,459
where you have a 25 year old

475
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,320
you know temple ball that goes for an

476
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,850
extraordinary amount of money well if I

477
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,089
wasn't such a poor farmer I'd be

478
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:11,250
librarian and all that hash but I this

479
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:13,230
is just what happens you got it you just

480
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,419
gotta sell it well I mean it really but

481
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,759
kind of bodes well for a glorious future

482
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:22,070
if it can unfold the way it should

483
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:25,079
unfold you know with the right products

484
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:27,058
being appreciated by the right people at

485
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:30,210
the right price point in the marketplace

486
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:33,798
you know yeah yeah that's that's true

487
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:38,759
and then also this this

488
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:42,359
commercialization of of this industry is

489
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:45,839
one of the things that that I feel very

490
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,279
hopeful about is is the home grower the

491
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,548
home grower is going to keep this

492
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,700
culture of giving and sharing and it's

493
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:55,279
really important that everyone grows

494
00:22:52,700 --> 00:23:00,470
there's six plants

495
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:03,920
and because that's its I mean going back

496
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,930
to to education I I have a special

497
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:10,400
connection or I have a connection with

498
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:14,210
with this herb and I can't express

499
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,090
enough how how much growth I have gone

500
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:20,299
through growing growing this medicine

501
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:22,929

502
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:27,319

503
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:30,019

504
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:33,829
and you know the more we get into it you

505
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:35,629
know the more we can talk because you

506
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,980
know it's all about the details and

507
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,470
getting into it but that's the essence

508
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:43,849
of craft isn't it it's how you do things

509
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:46,519
it's the process you know and and that's

510
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:49,309
what make that's I mean I my sense of

511
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:52,879
what crap makes craftspeople special and

512
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:55,000
what they care about is is every step of

513
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,490
what they're doing yeah just having

514
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,039
curiosity and always being changing and

515
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,529
