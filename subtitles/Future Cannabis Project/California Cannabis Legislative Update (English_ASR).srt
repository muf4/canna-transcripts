00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,330
I'm Amanda Chicago Louis I'm a

4
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:29,820
journalist I write a column for Rolling

5
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,618
Stone so what we're gonna do is I'm

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,020
gonna introduce each person on the panel

7
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:36,269
and as I introduce them I'm gonna ask

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,690
them a specific question that I've come

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,129
up with mostly out of my own curiosity

10
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:43,018
because I'm a curious person so let's

11
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:47,729
start with Assemblymember Jones Sawyer

12
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:49,439
ah Reggie Jones Sawyer a very prominent

13
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:51,808
vote for cannabis in the California

14
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,539
Legislature represents parts of South

15
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:58,468
Los Angeles Assemblymember my question

16
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,660
for you is are you satisfied with the

17
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,359
pace that the city of Los Angeles is

18
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:10,459
moving at cannabis wives good morning

19
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:14,849
as a resident of South Los Angeles and a

20
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:16,849
former member retired city employee at

21
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,189
work 25 years with decieved Los Angeles

22
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:23,728
I'm a recovering bureaucrat and so I

23
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:27,840
actually know probably why the city

24
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:31,019
moves at its pace the big the one reason

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,689
why I ran is because elected officials

26
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,459
like me I can talk about me now used to

27
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:37,559
come up with laws and then foisted on

28
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,688
bureaucrats and a lot of times we didn't

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,519
give them enough resources enough money

30
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:44,489
and sometimes it was just a stupid-ass

31
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,719
idea but we had to we we would have to

32
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:51,179
make it happen I think in this case a

33
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:53,519
lot of times elected officials come up

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,070
with ideas and then put it out there and

35
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,658
then they hire a cat a cat Packard

36
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,819
didn't they hire other people to make it

37
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,950
happen what they should have done was

38
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,379
talked to the bureaucracy and say how do

39
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,099
we make this happen how do we ensure

40
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:10,560
that um that we get it at the right pace

41
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,750
but more important that we do it right

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,269
the Steve los answer is struggling

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,939
between making sure we do it right and

44
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:20,879
getting it actually done and I think

45
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:23,009
what happens is with not just la any law

46
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,590
that comes out we ultimately have

47
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:28,500
gridlock or things don't get done or

48
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,920
money sits in accounts somewhere where

49
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,689
people saying that the bureaucracy too

50
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:34,449
onerous when in fact what we'd probably

51
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:36,848
need to do is

52
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:39,280
step back deceive lost enemy to step

53
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:41,259
back talk to the individuals here who

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,449
have to implement that law and those who

55
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:45,878
will have to ultimately make it happen

56
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:47,649
and have another conversation okay

57
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:49,479
because it's not moving as fast as you

58
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,370
should all right it's not moving as fast

59
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:53,079
as it should if you you're not aware the

60
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,849
city of Los Angeles biggest and most

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,830
important cannabis market on the planet

62
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,009
moving very slowly with licensing

63
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,840
businesses you heard it here first

64
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:03,699
Assemblymember jones-sawyer we're doing

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,439
the best that we can he understands the

66
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:06,818
bureaucracy and the reasons why it's

67
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,370
moving slowly but we should be moving

68
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:11,589
faster our next panelist Hezekiah Allen

69
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,019
third-generation cannabis grower from

70
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,909
Humboldt County has spent the last five

71
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:17,560
years fighting for his community in

72
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:19,090
Sacramento first on behalf of the

73
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Emerald Growers Association now I'm back

74
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,280
of the California Growers Association

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,170
key to note neither Association is only

76
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,180
for growers what industry-wide

77
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,309
California Growers Association biggest

78
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,200
industry group in California hezekiah

79
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,610
has announced he is leaving his position

80
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,280
at the end of the year to move into

81
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,780
business Hezekiah did I miss read that

82
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,049
announcement or did you say nobody

83
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:46,840
should replace you question mark I'm I

84
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:50,139
did say that I to use mr. Jones lawyers

85
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,639
you know we as staff of associations are

86
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,530
sort of like your bureaucrats and

87
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,689
sometimes our board tells us to do

88
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,519
things and then maybe doesn't come up

89
00:03:55,689 --> 00:04:00,068
with the money or doesn't follow through

90
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,900
and so I I think that the you what I'm

91
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:04,388
recommending is that the licensees

92
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,010
themselves step up and you know that we

93
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,350
have a matrix management structure that

94
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,879
puts board and staff in more constant

95
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,129
contact with more touch points between

96
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,388
the two I think a slightly hybrid

97
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,789
management model will serve the

98
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,949
organization and the industry and allow

99
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,959
us to really maintain our triple mandate

100
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:21,728
two of the businesses but also to the

101
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,250
communities and to the places where we

102
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:26,259
do business so I am encouraging that we

103
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,779
get new age with it and look at a matrix

104
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:30,699
management structure and and encourage

105
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:32,348
every single one of you what that means

106
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,659
is that we need more folks to step up

107
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:35,978
into leadership positions so encourage

108
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,570
every one of you to get involved with

109
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:39,969
your friendly association whether it's

110
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:42,129
ours Erin's or any of the other ones we

111
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,289
all need you guys so you did read that

112
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:47,659
right all right Hezekiah one of a kind

113
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:49,789
never forget our next panel

114
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,670
Aaron Smith executive director of the

115
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,500
National cannabis Industry Association

116
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,090
more of a Colorado DC person than a

117
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,069
California person but we'll forgive him

118
00:04:56,089 --> 00:05:00,079
for that Aaron what do you know about

119
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:05,240
trumps Washington and cannabis that we

120
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:09,740
don't I'm a native Californian by them

121
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,180
oh I apologize well you know like like

122
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,769
anything that you're reading with the

123
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,610
the Trump administration there's a

124
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:19,069
little bit of schizophrenia there and

125
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,889
we're so you're seeing sort of a revolt

126
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:24,290
with the staff on all a myriad of issues

127
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:27,889
if you've if you've read any that the

128
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:29,930
recent articles or anonymous sources and

129
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,069
that pretty much comports with what

130
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,180
we're hearing out of the White House

131
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:37,099
which is that there is a very concerted

132
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,329
effort on the part of White House staff

133
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,830
to undermine the industry led by

134
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:44,779
attorney general jeff Sessions who is

135
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:48,319
not really in the president's favor

136
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:52,509
right now that said we are confident

137
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:55,099
that at least the president is is

138
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,659
philosophically more in alignment with

139
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,390
the states rights approach on this issue

140
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,370
as he has said in his support for the

141
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:04,250
States Act and of course throughout the

142
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:07,699
the campaign prior to that so it's you

143
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:10,100
know continuing to educate those at the

144
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:12,379
staff level that if we're going to

145
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,660
really look at the cannabis issue as

146
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:16,399
they're there their recently announced

147
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,050
commission or uncovered the Commission

148
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,269
that is looking at the cannabis issue

149
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,930
from a very negative perspective on how

150
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:25,129
to undo the the the facts they call it

151
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,530
the messaging but the facts that

152
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:29,269
regulation works is that they need to be

153
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:31,339
looking at the whole picture and in

154
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:33,259
looking at this at how this is

155
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:34,759
beneficial to the community as well as

156
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,319
maybe some of the negative impacts that

157
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,029
are out there that I would say are

158
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,719
clearly outweighed by the positive

159
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:41,179
gotcha

160
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,040
Aaron of course referring to the secret

161
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,329
Commission that we discovered existed at

162
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,490
the Department of Justice recently

163
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:48,379
looking into the cannabis industry and

164
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,850
how to undermine it and letting us know

165
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,560
that yes there are people in Washington

166
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,910
who hate cannabis but maybe the White

167
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,918
House is too much of a mess to really do

168
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,580
anything about it

169
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,949
yeah our next panelist max mica lowness

170
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:03,469
max was a staff yes I say correctly okay

171
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:07,069
max was a staffer for Assemblymember

172
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,650
Robb Bonta when the original many many

173
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:11,360
three years ago version of the rules of

174
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:14,989
legalization was being put together in

175
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,910
Sacramento now he works as a lobbyist /

176
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,250
consultant I got confused about those

177
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,370
words they're all kind of meaningless

178
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,259
Max is a very deep policy wonk and I

179
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,670
want to ask you max since you understand

180
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,899
everything that's going on in a lot of

181
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,270
detail that people don't necessarily

182
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:31,639
understand themselves what is the

183
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:33,469
biggest confusion that you are seeing

184
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,879
what is the biggest misunderstanding

185
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:41,300
that people have about what's going on

186
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:43,759
in California very good question I think

187
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,040
I think the base confusion that is out

188
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,209
there that's still out there is in and I

189
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,220
don't think we have an answer to this is

190
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:51,589
what's gonna happen on January 10th to

191
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,990
2019 what's gonna happen when the

192
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:56,539
collective model finally gets phased out

193
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,129
and what is enforcement going to look

194
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,660
like what is the middle market gonna

195
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,909
look like what will the adult use market

196
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,490
look like and how have we moved because

197
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:07,060
you know said before 20 will go and

198
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:10,129
lapse one year after the bureau issued

199
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:13,939
notice and that day is January 9th when

200
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:15,889
is one said before 20 collective

201
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:18,319
productions will expire so what's going

202
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:19,519
to happen then and without any legal

203
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,889
protections from prosecution for

204
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,649
medicinal operators that have been in

205
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:27,229
the legacy market in the gray market how

206
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:27,769
will the state respond and for those

207
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,450
folks

208
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:31,789
what plans of what steps have they been

209
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:33,620
taking over this last year to enter the

210
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,360
regulated market and try to work with

211
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,720
their local governments and get licensed

212
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,340
so I think that there's bylaw feel

213
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,810
hoping and even should even that last

214
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,490
week I heard people saying we're gonna

215
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:46,099
get that pushed back right that that's

216
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,799
not gonna happen right and no it's

217
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,389
happening and how that industry deals

218
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,490
with that how long for some deals with

219
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:54,439
that and what steps were taking between

220
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,360
now and then I think are critical yeah

221
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,950
so in case you weren't clear on that

222
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,300
max referring to the fact that we have

223
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,740
all of these cannabis dispensaries in

224
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:02,929
California that are not technically

225
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,899
licensed by the state that are operating

226
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:08,089
under what will soon be obsolete legal

227
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:10,709
protections as quote-unquote collectives

228
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,420
they aren't supposed to be for profit

229
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:16,620
that's actually true obviously depends

230
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:18,269
on the on the store in question but what

231
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,669
is going to happen when we sunset those

232
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:22,439
protections as thin as they are are we

233
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:24,389
gonna see a huge wave of enforcement

234
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,300
crackdown all right and now finally

235
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:30,419
former California Attorney General and

236
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:34,019
current something high up at sea for

237
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:37,379
distro a distribution company sorry Eric

238
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,360
mr. Bill Lockyer mr. Locher do you

239
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:40,830
regret being part of the war on drugs

240
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:50,279
now that you are profiting off of

241
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:52,740
legalization as someone who used to burn

242
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,289
about 20 million plants a year and of

243
00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:01,049
course most of the burners wanted to be

244
00:09:55,289 --> 00:10:03,480
downwind from the event that was the job

245
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:06,120
and it was came with the office now of

246
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,899
course I also as a candidate who

247
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,419
supported 215 when I ran for attorney

248
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,189
general I had all the narcs opposing me

249
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:20,490
because that was my view and of course

250
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:22,170
support of Prop 64 so my views haven't

251
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,570
changed over the years but my

252
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:26,929
responsibilities happened so I'm happy

253
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,640
to be part of with Eric Spitz the

254
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:31,859
distribution center of this particular

255
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,929
Enterprise I'm enjoying our political

256
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,580
answers this morning which are everybody

257
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:36,899
who works in government is just doing

258
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,770
the best with the responsibilities

259
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:42,720
they've been given thank you guys so I

260
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:44,069
want to do I think a good a good

261
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,060
question that I think everybody can

262
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,890
answer maybe let's max these answers out

263
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,799
at like one sentence just so we can sort

264
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:56,189
of like pull the the crew on this I'm

265
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:59,309
wondering what is the biggest challenge

266
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:02,430
for cannabis legalization in California

267
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:06,479
right now what is the biggest single

268
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:10,079
challenge we are facing cracking down on

269
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:14,820
the illegal market call cannabis still

270
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,379
isn't legal in most of the state and the

271
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,110
underlying problem is that cannabis is

272
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:22,210
not legal at the federal level

273
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,940
lack of sufficient retail access for the

274
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:27,910
license supply chain

275
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,170
well since everyone popped something

276
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:32,009
that came from their particular

277
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:35,860
expertise maybe as a government teacher

278
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:37,720
long ago the one I ought to say because

279
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,440
of the snarky comments about government

280
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:45,009
that most people don't understand we

281
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,190
have a governmental system designed not

282
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:50,379
to work it's why there's three branches

283
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,660
of government three levels of government

284
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:56,980
all the vetoes and overrides and all

285
00:11:52,659 --> 00:12:00,309
that stuff it's very slow and it takes a

286
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,170
long time examples would be women's

287
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:04,750
right to vote there are a lot of other

288
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:07,269
examples but it takes a long time to

289
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:10,779
move it all in the same direction and

290
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:13,750
partly it takes the community here and

291
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:16,289
outside to work together in a unified

292
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,669
way to make progress whether it's

293
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:20,889
enforcement or banking or the other

294
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:22,990
issues that people have mentioned thank

295
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:26,799
you and also I'm equal-opportunity snark

296
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,870
I've been a snark industry - so we're

297
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,439
talking a little bit here about the

298
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,060
illicit market and I think most of us in

299
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,950
this room are aware that especially in

300
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:38,139
Southern California we've got illicit

301
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:42,160
businesses outnumbering licensed

302
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:44,169
businesses ten to one since this is a

303
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,980
very Sacramento oriented panel I think

304
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:51,309
I'm curious is there anything the state

305
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:57,039
can do about the illicit market and if

306
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:58,449
so what regulate it what what does that

307
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,299
mean I need more information give them

308
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,100
licenses the only difference between an

309
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:04,750
illegal business and a legal business is

310
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,430
a license and it's incredibly

311
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,409
pretentious of those of us who have

312
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:13,289
licenses to condemn the rest of us to

313
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:13,289
jail so are you saying

314
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:21,810
make it much easier for people to get

315
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:23,790
licenses make it cheaper reduce the

316
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:25,439
barriers to entry let people in deal

317
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:26,849
with it as a civil matter if you can't

318
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,310
run a business you're gonna fail this

319
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,170
markets incredibly saturated there's way

320
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,359
too much product most businesses won't

321
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:35,250
make it but a failing business should

322
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,000
not be a jail cell it should not be

323
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:41,129
civil forfeiture asset forfeiture you

324
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,769
know three years ago we were all illegal

325
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:45,600
businesses 20 years ago we were all

326
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,819
really really illegal and guess what

327
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,529
that's what it took for us to get here

328
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,800
that that was all of the hard work that

329
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:54,480
went into this you know that we need to

330
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,009
reduce the barriers to entry we need to

331
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,509
bring more businesses in we need to

332
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,549
support aaron at the federal level so

333
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:01,950
that we can have an actual real market

334
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:04,079
california is the global powerhouse in

335
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,390
agriculture we supply the world with so

336
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,160
many commodities if you told California

337
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:10,259
almond growers that they could only sell

338
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,750
in state it would be a disaster olives

339
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,340
tomatoes whatever crop it is we need to

340
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,350
follow through on this fight and we need

341
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,180
to not lock people up in the meantime

342
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,250
the war on drugs as Senator de Leon

343
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,349
mentioned impacted poor people and poor

344
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,879
people of color specifically those are

345
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,759
exactly the same people that are getting

346
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,529
impacted now I know I represent 850

347
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,120
unlicensed businesses these are

348
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:31,860
hardworking folks that have been engaged

349
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,539
in this process for several years and

350
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,669
they're still unlicensed they're poor

351
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,439
and they're minorities that is who is

352
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:39,779
going to get swept up into this nonsense

353
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,640
exactly the same as they always have we

354
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,500
need to reduce the barriers to entry we

355
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,120
need to push hard on local control make

356
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,399
sure there are permits everywhere so

357
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,289
that we can bring the recce the market

358
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,939
regulation needs to come to the market

359
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:53,959
we don't need to start over and build a

360
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,960
new regulated market

361
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:05,860
Assemblymember so it's uh someone that

362
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:07,750
represents individuals where the war on

363
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,990
crime was on board people who look like

364
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,309
me and Latino as a chair of Public

365
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,860
Safety and I've been to more prisons

366
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:17,139
than everyone in this room put together

367
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,820
and probably outside this room and I all

368
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:20,500
I've seen as african-americans live and

369
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,589
Latinos most of them were put in jail

370
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:28,450
because of cannabis I agree we need to

371
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:31,269
work real hard to ensure we get more

372
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:33,850
people into the system that we get more

373
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:36,578
legal that's what I work for us why did

374
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,589
the bills on on medical marijuana and I

375
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:41,289
work to make sure that it was legalized

376
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:44,260
for adult use because I I honestly felt

377
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:46,059
that individuals from my community who

378
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:48,458
were on the street selling marijuana

379
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:50,500
been aged selling in the city statewide

380
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:53,679
some became national some became

381
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,899
international cannabis dealers without a

382
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,969
degree from USC or Harvard from Wharton

383
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,679
they don't have a business degree they

384
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,170
didn't but they understood marketing

385
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:05,679
accounts receivable payable all of that

386
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:08,169
stuff now that you're want to be legal

387
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,299
and a lot of you wanted to be legal that

388
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:12,338
meant you're coming into my world but

389
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:14,379
when you come into my world you come

390
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,560
into the government world and as mr.

391
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:20,980
Locklear said that's a different world

392
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:24,639
to protect you as you come in the reason

393
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,680
I said that biggest largest problem

394
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,929
we're gonna have is the illegal market

395
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:30,969
because if that market can still

396
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:33,489
undercut you because they don't pay

397
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,860
taxes remember you guys told me you

398
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,810
wanted this to be legal and you were

399
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,579
really willing to pay taxes you're

400
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:42,519
jumping up and down saying as long as we

401
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:44,259
get in will pay taxes now all the most

402
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,929
you sound like Republicans we're paying

403
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:49,328
too much taxes you turn Republican

404
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:51,698
overnight and I understand that but

405
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:53,739
understand when you when you let the Fox

406
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:55,179
into the chicken coop and a couple of

407
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,560
chickens are missing don't come

408
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:59,500
complaining to me because a couple of

409
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,069
chickens are missing government taxes

410
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,789
that's what we do and Democrats

411
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,669
unfortunately we're not really good with

412
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:09,369
tax credits and tax breaks and all that

413
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:10,270
so we still need to work on that and I

414
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,309
even had a building

415
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:16,000
if your businesses tax breaks so you can

416
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:17,619
thrive but what will ultimately undercut

417
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,930
them what I'm hearing is the illegal

418
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:22,809
business across the street can sit there

419
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:24,910
and set their price below you because

420
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:27,490
they know they're not paying taxes and

421
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,320
so if you think you can thrive and we

422
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:34,599
can just let these businesses just stay

423
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:38,169
open and like in LA was it 132 over 1100

424
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:40,179
illegal if you think you can out do

425
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:44,710
those illegal without us doing something

426
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:47,200
to actively shut them down then you're

427
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,259
living in that Fox in the chicken coop

428
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,990
analogy think it through

429
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:55,869
we've got to do something to shut them

430
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:58,000
down and I tried to get 75 million

431
00:17:55,869 --> 00:18:01,239
dollars into the budget this year which

432
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,470
Jerry Brown said no and he said no

433
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,819
because waiting for the profits that

434
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,309
come in so which comes first the chicken

435
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:08,950
or the eggs so I'm trying to tell them

436
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:11,200
for you to thrive we've got to give you

437
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,509
tax breaks we've got to think we got to

438
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,420
do some things but most important we've

439
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:18,309
got to make sure you can't compete not

440
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,110
only against each other but ultimately

441
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:22,269
you also got to compete with the illegal

442
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:24,429
market and we've got to be able to make

443
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:26,650
sure that you are able to do that and

444
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,299
not as a decided disadvantage because

445
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,090
they can sell their products much

446
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:32,680
cheaper than you and I can go across the

447
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:34,269
street and get it if nobody's gonna

448
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,789
bother me guess where I'm gonna go

449
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:41,289
across the street to get the same

450
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:41,889
product you got so please think this

451
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:44,049
thing through

452
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,420
or at least give us help I don't want to

453
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:49,899
throw a whole bunch of african-american

454
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,880
Latino men women in jail that is not the

455
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,769
purpose of shutting them down there's

456
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,840
ways we can shut them down without

457
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:57,819
filling out prison so if you work with

458
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,579
us you work with the government we can

459
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:04,240
do this right yeah I think two very

460
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:07,500
valid answers yeah my sense is that

461
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,289
there's some the inconsistency is really

462
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:15,220
are the people who are in the illicit

463
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:16,930
market they're intentionally or are they

464
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,100
trying to get into the weevil market and

465
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,690
I think those are probably two different

466
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:21,039
populations but I think what both of you

467
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,028
said is valid does anyone else want to

468
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,940
add to the

469
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:27,219
conversation yeah you know just the

470
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,889
touch on the two points made previously

471
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:32,619
two speakers previously you know with

472
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:34,329
you know eleven hundred unlicensed

473
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:37,808
retailers in City of LA I think his

474
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:40,148
number Reggie said there's only a

475
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:43,418
hundred and thirty five licensed

476
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:44,949
retailers in City of LA so before we go

477
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:46,330
and say shut down the eleven hundred we

478
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,159
need to give them a shot to come into

479
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:50,048
the marketplace and figure out which

480
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:52,629
ones those actually want to make it

481
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:54,638
which one of those our bad actors are

482
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:56,378
not intend to comply and things like

483
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:57,098
that so that's just the merger of both

484
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:59,378
comments

485
00:19:57,098 --> 00:20:02,648
so whatever incentives this or support

486
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:04,058
the state can supply to the cities or to

487
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:07,478
them whether it's a carrot or a stick

488
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:12,460
approach on on support on revenue on

489
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:15,009
whatnot because you know just you I

490
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,159
think you know Jackie used this parable

491
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:20,378
you can't go turn off one faucet without

492
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,389
turning on another you can't just shut

493
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:24,848
down the legal market without providing

494
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:26,829
a pathway forward into the legal market

495
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:28,808
right and I think you know the latest

496
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:30,548
numbers to clarify there what I've seen

497
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:32,769
is we're at a hundred and sixty-four

498
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:34,838
licensed retailers in the city of Los

499
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:36,729
Angeles the city controller has said

500
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:39,069
there are seventeen hundred illicit

501
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:41,080
retail operations obviously very

502
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:43,598
difficult to track and in case you

503
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:46,118
aren't aware there's not a timeline yet

504
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:47,918
for when it illicit dispensaries in the

505
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:50,319
city of Los Angeles will even be able to

506
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,909
apply for a license shirt there's not

507
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,088
even a timeline for when that's going to

508
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:57,669
happen let alone funding so let's move

509
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:59,440
on to another fun question and Max and

510
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:00,940
Bill this might be more for you um so I

511
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,369
think we all saw a very interesting

512
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,308
thing happen in Sacramento with delivery

513
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:08,528
statewide this year and we don't need to

514
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:10,210
get into that argument too much but I do

515
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:12,219
want to summarize what happened in terms

516
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:16,269
of there was a bill moving around the

517
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:18,570
legislature around will delivery

518
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:20,769
operations be able to deliver to every

519
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:23,528
municipality regardless of whether they

520
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:24,878
have a commercial sales ban and then

521
00:21:23,528 --> 00:21:27,999
after that bill fell out of the

522
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:31,269
legislature we saw the bureau add that

523
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:33,819
as a rule in their latest proposed rules

524
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:35,710
I'm just curious as someone who's

525
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:38,950
time's fine sacrament two very confusing

526
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,240
is there a way for people to understand

527
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,980
better in the future

528
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,009
what is the Legislature's responsibility

529
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,569
and what is the bureau's responsibility

530
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:49,629
the Bureau of cannabis control of course

531
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:51,309
is what we're referring to here yeah

532
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,560
just uh not going to is made of the

533
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:55,089
details there but with the legislature

534
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,000
the responsibility to you know passed

535
00:21:55,089 --> 00:22:00,339
laws enact laws get them approved having

536
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,920
them be voted on by Reggie and then be

537
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:06,519
signed by the governor or something over

538
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,870
jones-sawyer sorry and then be signed by

539
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:10,420
the governor and that's up to the

540
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:12,009
agencies to implement those laws and so

541
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,370
when the bureau came out with regulation

542
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:17,529
54 16 D which was as were terming at

543
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:19,449
delivery freedom and essentially says

544
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:21,849
that delivery services have the ability

545
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,680
to deliver into any municipality in the

546
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:25,779
state of California they are viewing

547
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,720
that as a clarification of existing law

548
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:31,240
and so that's why they felt while SB

549
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,990
1302 the Laura bill that was trying to

550
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,730
go and make it explicit in state law and

551
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,759
that would then have directed the bureau

552
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,500
to you know make that clarification the

553
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,539
bureau then felt they didn't enough

554
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,410
authority within existing law to make

555
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:48,579
the clarification on their own accord so

556
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,950
you know if you're trying to force the

557
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:52,929
regulators to do something Allah will

558
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,250
make them go and do that but they do

559
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:57,220
have flexibility within their own

560
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,950
administrative regulations love me a

561
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,700
walkie answer Thank You max um so I

562
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:06,220
think yes please please so I'll give you

563
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:09,250
a you asked about the legislative

564
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:12,640
process so as many of you know I was one

565
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:15,009
of the five five legislators because of

566
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,770
the founding five that helped write the

567
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:19,390
rules for medical marijuana one of the

568
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:23,039
founding five I'm not gonna mention

569
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:25,900
names believed in local control and

570
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,559
since they're all males I can say and he

571
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:31,630
was passing around that bill to try to

572
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:33,250
get it done and he wanted to start with

573
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,040
the founding five because if you know I

574
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,390
don't know if if all five of us sign on

575
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,480
to something there's a pretty good

576
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:44,320
chance that it will be made into law I

577
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,110
was the one that said BS this is stupid

578
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,529
if if your city doesn't want

579
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:51,639
Cannabis but they want to deny

580
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:54,039
individuals who need it for medical

581
00:23:51,640 --> 00:24:00,790
purposes from having it delivered I'm

582
00:23:54,039 --> 00:24:03,159
not down with that and so so I refuse to

583
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:07,058
sign and you could see it start to lose

584
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:09,040
some steam and ultimately go away the

585
00:24:07,058 --> 00:24:12,490
governor too believed in local control

586
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,230
but he also believed that we need to get

587
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,240
it to as many people medically as

588
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:19,000
possible and he didn't want to interrupt

589
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,769
that and that might be why some movement

590
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,619
was made administrative Lee which the

591
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:26,980
governor has control over and so it's a

592
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:28,928
it's it's kind of to check some balances

593
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,599
of where if we're all working together

594
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:33,070
on the same on the same wavelength we

595
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,769
can get something done quicker through

596
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:37,779
the administrative process or you take

597
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:39,429
that long laborious process that I have

598
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:41,710
to go through which takes a year and

599
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:44,440
then it's what enacted three months

600
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:49,200
later we can do that long process so

601
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:51,610
it's both thank you that's very helpful

602
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,519
I'll just quickly say you know to the

603
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:56,769
original question the the agencies may

604
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,720
not break the law obviously they are

605
00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:01,089
responsible for implementing the law and

606
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,058
they have a lot of wiggle room within

607
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:05,199
what they do to implement the law you

608
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:07,210
know think about some of the things that

609
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,460
have been achieved through regs the type

610
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,019
a shared license distro transport

611
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,480
transport only you know there are a lot

612
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:16,000
of relatively big pieces that have come

613
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,400
out of the reg process if it doesn't

614
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,079
break the law and it doesn't break any

615
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,970
other law but it will help them

616
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,859
implement it they can do it so you know

617
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,329
three years ago we were all legislative

618
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:27,219
we're gonna need to learn more about

619
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:28,269
regulatory affairs interesting

620
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,819
interesting

621
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:32,889
so Assemblymember John Sawyer made a

622
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:34,569
little reference to the governor earlier

623
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,669
and the fact I think someone said that

624
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:38,859
we have a bill waiting on the current

625
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:41,110
governor's desk but we also all know

626
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:45,009
there is an election happening very soon

627
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:46,959
I think most people are sort of assuming

628
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:49,450
at this point that we are expecting a

629
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,808
governor Gavin Newsom in our future I'm

630
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:57,130
curious for all of our folks on the

631
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:59,519
panel what is going to change once we

632
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:02,700
have a presumably

633
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,470
gavin newsom as our governor or do you

634
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,830
not think he's gonna be governor but

635
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:12,539
what's gonna change for Canada

636
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:13,889
sure I mean I'm never shy I guess I you

637
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,200
know I don't know that much will change

638
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:19,860
the checks and balances that mr. Locke

639
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,720
you're outlined are still present there

640
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:23,369
are still a lot of steps in the process

641
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,589
the governor certainly holds a lot of

642
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:27,750
influence over Sacramento but you know

643
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:29,279
the the five are still there there are

644
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,589
still a lot of lawmakers there are

645
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,240
agencies you know I think what we can

646
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:36,899
say with certainty is that mr. Newsom

647
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,870
did support prop 64 you can read his own

648
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,400
words he supported it largely through

649
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:42,839
you know he doesn't want his kids around

650
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,910
it he doesn't like it he wants it

651
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,740
regulated and controlled that's sort of

652
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:51,000
a synopsis of a handful of his quotes

653
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,920
but he's not a a real pro cannabis free

654
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,470
the weed sort of a guy that said he's

655
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,370
also a pretty reasonable guy who

656
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,950
recognizes that the past

657
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:03,029
policy regime has has failed us pretty

658
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:05,640
pretty pretty grandly so I think that we

659
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:07,470
can expect no backsliding things will

660
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,140
continue to progress I mean I think if

661
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,089
Cox were to pull the votes together that

662
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,060
we could we'd probably expect to see

663
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:16,649
some some really some regress and so it

664
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,169
you know I think we can expect solid

665
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:21,180
stability at the very least I don't know

666
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,400
that we should be expecting any big

667
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,320
structural changes to regulation in the

668
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,120
next few years though I think that you

669
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,799
know the concrete is setting up on the

670
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,189
foundation and now we're gonna build it

671
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,720
so any big changes you probably need to

672
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,640
go back to the voters if you have those

673
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,029
in your imagination right now is a good

674
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,800
time to to build with what we have it's

675
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,299
been set and I expect the next

676
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,019
administration will largely follow

677
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:47,579
through on that and probably mr. mr.

678
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:50,190
Locher probably has more experience to

679
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:51,779
that than about being a candidate Isis

680
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,850
or being an activist sitting out in the

681
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,799
audience and saying what you should do

682
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:57,599
being a candidate and saying what you

683
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,549
will do and then when you finally get

684
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,500
into a statewide office and do what

685
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:03,809
you're supposed to do it's completely

686
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:09,950
different and you have all these

687
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:12,549
different hats and I'm hoping that when

688
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,680
governor Newsom gets in

689
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:17,829
that because he has a good business

690
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,430
background because he's been progressive

691
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:24,419
on a lot of issues especially this and

692
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:28,029
and and that he has a concern for

693
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:31,150
protections and and making sure that the

694
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:33,430
that we do this legally that when we

695
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:36,910
bring taxpayer Givens that when we bring

696
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:39,070
tax breaks forward for this industry he

697
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:41,050
will have a better understanding of how

698
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:43,329
if you give someone a tax break that

699
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:45,579
will bring in that's an investment in

700
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:48,429
that industry which should bring back

701
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:50,199
more money into the general fund I think

702
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,330
a lot of times elected officials are

703
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,920
reticent to do that because they don't

704
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:55,720
know how much money is going in they'd

705
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,000
rather see how much money come in first

706
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,259
before the other again which comes first

707
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,900
the chicken or the egg and if you're a

708
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:04,660
business person you you look at tax

709
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,850
breaks as incentives to bring in more

710
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:10,060
money to make your business thrive and I

711
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:11,589
think sometimes elected officials I'm

712
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:13,899
not gonna pick on any one party but

713
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:16,480
sometimes elected officials don't see it

714
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,970
that way they see the general fund going

715
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,279
down every time you give a tax break and

716
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,279
it's not always that way sometimes you

717
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:27,129
can spurn industry on the one I'm

718
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:29,889
thinking of is the the the internet and

719
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,210
and a whole you know the things we

720
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:34,120
talked about net neutrality and all of

721
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,519
that we had to start coming in after we

722
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:39,039
let that industry thrive with little or

723
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,599
no government intervention now we're

724
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,950
coming in on the back end to do some

725
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:44,049
things I think right now with this

726
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,940
industry we want to do it right and at

727
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:48,609
the right pace and that's that's the

728
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:51,640
struggle and so I'm hoping that mr.

729
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:54,099
Newsom will really take the tax

730
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:58,830
incentive part and run with it

731
00:29:54,099 --> 00:30:01,379
like crazy well I first of all think

732
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:04,240
Gavin Newsom will be the next governor

733
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:08,140
that he clearly understands and

734
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,430
participated in writing the new law and

735
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:14,490
is an advocate for it so whether it's

736
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:17,259
robust enforcement or protecting small

737
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,789
entry players or those that have been in

738
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:22,900
the business a long time those are all

739
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:24,940
stated goals and I don't expect the law

740
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,929
to change a lot that what's really going

741
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,700
to change is the mark

742
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:29,980
place I'm surprised to hear you mention

743
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,970
that governor Newsom or lieutenant

744
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,980
governor Newsom might be protecting

745
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:37,480
small players I think that's right okay

746
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:41,079
Aaron don't ask me well I just wanted to

747
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,149
add on that I think that I I'm hopeful

748
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,220
anyway that will see more advocacy for

749
00:30:43,148 --> 00:30:46,778
California at the federal level in that

750
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,548
and not to say that Governor Brown

751
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:50,349
hasn't advocated for California and

752
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:53,499
defended California on cannabis and

753
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:56,798
myriad of other issues in DC but I think

754
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:58,868
because of Governor future Governor

755
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,418
Newsom's role in in the development of

756
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:04,329
Prop 64 that we will see a more

757
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:06,309
steadfast advocate in the governor's

758
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,898
office as we work to change federal laws

759
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:10,329
and I think it's it's really notable

760
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:11,618
that we're seeing a Crandon and this

761
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:13,689
will be the case and I think Colorado

762
00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:15,759
and other states that have developed

763
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,220
cannabis markets where we're seeing pro

764
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,169
cannabis governor's likely to be elected

765
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,240
but it's really notable that in an

766
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:24,399
election year it used to be really hard

767
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,288
to get anybody on the record to talk

768
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,729
about you know supporting reform and

769
00:31:26,288 --> 00:31:28,960
they wait till next year I mean this was

770
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,990
just a couple years ago that's how it

771
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,249
was now we're seeing members of Congress

772
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,288
who never supported the issue

773
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:36,490
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for

774
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:40,179
example coming forward with

775
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:42,669
comprehensive legislation to curry favor

776
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:45,340
with with millennial voters 70% of which

777
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:47,169
support our issue and the industry right

778
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:48,999
right and becoming an issue as we saw

779
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:51,940
recently in the debate with Ted Cruz and

780
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:56,889
beta or orc it's more of a thing um all

781
00:31:51,940 --> 00:32:00,820
right yeah okay just one last point here

782
00:31:56,888 --> 00:32:03,308
I anticipate the Newsom's actions as

783
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:05,638
governor on cannabis will be until be

784
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:08,230
oriented more towards the national stage

785
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:10,359
he's got a long career ahead of him and

786
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,878
there is an office higher than governor

787
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:14,048
of California okay all right and of

788
00:32:12,878 --> 00:32:15,638
course I think we've seen him be a

789
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:18,519
little more vocally Pro cannabis than

790
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:20,138
Governor Brown all right so we're gonna

791
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,359
do one more question and then we're

792
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,859
gonna do Q&amp;A in like five minutes if

793
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,359
people are getting excited about their

794
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:28,209
questions if I haven't asked enough

795
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,709
questions for you um should we do

796
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:32,100
regrets or should we do Canadian money

797
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:34,749
where do you guys want to go with this

798
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:37,778
let's do regrets all right great so I'm

799
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:40,610
curious in the past three years

800
00:32:37,778 --> 00:32:42,679
what each of you have seen you know for

801
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:45,319
each of your experiences if there was

802
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:47,778
one thing you could change about how

803
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:49,788
legalization has played out in

804
00:32:47,778 --> 00:32:52,069
California in the past three years

805
00:32:49,788 --> 00:32:54,200
whether it's something you did something

806
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:56,418
you know the legislature did whether it

807
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,429
was this one rule that was in prop 64

808
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:59,870
that you wish was different what's the

809
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:04,580
one thing that you really wish you could

810
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:07,518
go back and change starting to be a

811
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:09,408
pattern here I'm still not shy suppose I

812
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,278
think the bottom line is that we needed

813
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:16,730
a longer timeline we had 25 years of

814
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:19,669
unregulated criminal marijuana spelled

815
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,079
with an H then we had 20 years of legal

816
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:23,840
marijuana

817
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:27,019
prop 215 then these five got together

818
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:29,058
and passed regulation well all 80 of

819
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:31,450
them passed it ultimately but 120 of

820
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:33,710
them passed regulations for medical and

821
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,759
then we threw an initiative right on top

822
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,440
of it and then we try to get everything

823
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:37,579
done by January 1st 2018 which is

824
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,990
completely impossible for bureaucrats

825
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:40,339
without a budget and it just doesn't

826
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,159
work and that's why everything's falling

827
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:46,638
on its face tada

828
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:49,129
I I was a big supporter of a you know

829
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:50,928
let's get Medical regulated by 2018

830
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:52,699
let's make sure our patients are safe

831
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,470
let's just make sure compassionate care

832
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,720
is at the core of the industry and then

833
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:00,019
let's build into and grow into adult use

834
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,569
the status quo wasn't working under prop

835
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:04,128
215 by any means but I'm not convinced

836
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:05,538
that what we're going to end up with is

837
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:08,719
going to be better in the short to

838
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:10,639
mid-term I think we rushed it and I

839
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,949
think that ultimately we should have

840
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,970
taken the time to implement the MC RSA

841
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:18,469
and then implement prop 64 and I also

842
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:20,388
think it would have been nice if the

843
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:24,039
protections for small businesses in prop

844
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:24,039
64 were actually enforced

845
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,009
[Applause]

846
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,700
well I this isn't I wouldn't say regret

847
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:36,100
but one thing that I'd like to remind

848
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:38,710
regulators and and lawmakers and even

849
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:41,380
the industry is that what the intent was

850
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:43,690
behind regulating cannabis it wasn't it

851
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,579
wasn't the voters in it didn't come to

852
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,500
the ballot box because they wanted to go

853
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:50,199
and buy legal cannabis for the most part

854
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,360
it was because we promised that we would

855
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:54,849
replace the criminal market with a

856
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,620
regulated one and offer all of the

857
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:59,139
societal and economic benefits that come

858
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:01,119
with that and we're doing it but I think

859
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,469
that we could do a better job and always

860
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,299
looking at everything especially the

861
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:05,469
regulatory level all of these issues

862
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,930
that we're talking about are actually

863
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:09,939
creating barriers for us to be able to

864
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:11,710
replace that criminal market right so

865
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,539
the ongoing criminalization of the

866
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,829
unlicensed market you feel like we've

867
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:17,619
sort of lost track of what the goal was

868
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:19,960
here I I think that we we need to just

869
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:21,579
continue to remember and keep that in

870
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,960
mind as the vision behind what we're

871
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:25,480
trying to do and there will always be a

872
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,280
criminal market until we have interstate

873
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,619
and international commerce and we can

874
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,860
export cannabis out of California like

875
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:34,809
they're starting to do up in Canada now

876
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,340
but always keeping that goal in mind is

877
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:38,889
that that is the purpose and the intent

878
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:42,510
behind the establishment of these these

879
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:42,509
modern cannabis laws yeah

880
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,130
probably the greatest regret is as we

881
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:53,769
were going through how we're going to

882
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:55,660
make this law happen in the legislature

883
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:58,179
one of the key things that we needed was

884
00:35:55,659 --> 00:36:01,359
local control and that that's how we

885
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:04,449
were able to get you know 60 something

886
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,690
votes in the assembly I regret that we

887
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:10,149
didn't come up with a formula whereby

888
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:13,090
cities that do not want cannabis

889
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:17,019
I'm sorry elected officials who do not

890
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:20,670
want cannabis in their cities that we

891
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:23,949
didn't devise a way maybe limited

892
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:25,690
licensing in in districts that don't

893
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:27,489
want it but we needed to get somewhere

894
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,909
to get the nose the camel's nose

895
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:34,629
underneath the tent and we we didn't we

896
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:37,659
didn't think of that and right now

897
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,610
Mike Mike the reason I backed off it

898
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:39,789
because I still firmly believe that when

899
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:42,070
we

900
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:44,920
have the next recession in California

901
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:47,080
the cities that have legalized cannabis

902
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,110
will be able to continue to operate with

903
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:52,809
limited or no no problems while the

904
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:56,289
others will struct it after fire fire

905
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:58,210
police reduce government and then the

906
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:59,590
people will say my neighbor next door is

907
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,360
not doing the same what is the

908
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,610
difference and it'll see that as the

909
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,470
revenue from cannabis but that again to

910
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:08,890
what others are saying that's a long

911
00:37:05,469 --> 00:37:10,599
that may take five years from now we

912
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:13,210
needed to do something where we gave a

913
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,940
statewide license that may have provided

914
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,530
there may have guaranteed I'm just

915
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:22,019
making up a number even if it's just one

916
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:25,690
or five cannabis operations in any city

917
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:27,969
then at least you could we could do the

918
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,909
experiment in that city make sure it's

919
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:32,589
done right and then hopefully the

920
00:37:30,909 --> 00:37:35,019
elected officials get that comfort level

921
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:37,120
or the citizenry get that comfort level

922
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:39,159
to say you know what it's legal let's

923
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,079
move on and I liken that the same as

924
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:43,449
liquor stores I don't want over

925
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:45,699
proliferation of liquor stores in my

926
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:47,439
area but I'm not going to say we should

927
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:50,139
be no more liquor stores in the city of

928
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,349
Los Angeles and so there's a way to do

929
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:52,389
it

930
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:54,789
we just couldn't we just didn't at the

931
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:57,039
time we were going so fast we just want

932
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:58,449
to get it done and and and if we said we

933
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,309
would come back and maybe that's

934
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:03,369
something we could look at later on this

935
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:06,039
next session how we need statewide make

936
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:11,049
it mandatory and on a limited basis

937
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:15,190
Thank You max mr. Locher would you like

938
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:19,019
to add a regret I just like that echo

939
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,019
him but on what the senator said

940
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:25,809
cities and counties they could not

941
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:27,879
handle local control they there it was

942
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:29,849
so big and coming at them so fast

943
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,170
especially with a constantly changing

944
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:34,179
state framework which gave them the

945
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,340
excuse of the regulations aren't

946
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:38,500
permanent were in the mercer regulations

947
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,210
when the merkerson regulations were in

948
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,829
the emergency regulations their proposed

949
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,360
right now they're proposed now we're

950
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:45,610
working on the draft final regulations

951
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,550
just kick the can down the road

952
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:51,460
repeatedly but going back to the point

953
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,640
the previous point you don't be in

954
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,760
cannabis

955
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,618
you being a legal cannabis and all these

956
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,470
cities with all these bans and refusal

957
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:02,269
to license has just gone and left that

958
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:07,669
to see that area to the illicit market

959
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:11,629
and so you know there was too much local

960
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:13,130
control and the ability to ban you know

961
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,588
should not necessarily have been on the

962
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,380
table and the problem is especially

963
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:20,028
going back to the very first bills one

964
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,099
of the very first bills had a drafting

965
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:25,338
error that drafting they were wet and

966
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:28,160
said if you do not regulate by March 1

967
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:30,230
2016 regulate cultivation then you lose

968
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:33,108
your local control over cultivation that

969
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:37,639
caused you know what's been termed bana

970
00:39:33,108 --> 00:39:39,380
Palooza and we're you know vast eighteen

971
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,838
ninety percent of the jurisdictions in

972
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,539
the state banned all as medical cannabis

973
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,548
activity because of drafting or that was

974
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:48,680
replaced by February so the amount of

975
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:51,528
damage done between signing the bills in

976
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:53,899
October and repealing that part in

977
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:56,449
February or March

978
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,190
we haven't gotten back from that to a

979
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:02,179
degree we haven't gotten back from those

980
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:05,990
bans and between that drafting error and

981
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:07,399
local control those were things that you

982
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,649
know hindsight says we should have

983
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,690
avoided for sure for sure and of course

984
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,160
I'm as everyone who is here probably

985
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,809
already knows the vast majority of

986
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:16,879
municipalities in California is banning

987
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:17,690
commercial cannabis sales mr. Alford is

988
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,210
there something you want to add we're

989
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:22,460
almost ready for our Q&amp;A otherwise you

990
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,829
got you got a regret what did you

991
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:26,720
recruit I would only kind of have to

992
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:28,880
agree with the comments made that we

993
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,018
could have taken more more time on the

994
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,970
front end although there was some

995
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:36,828
urgency that had developed over the

996
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:40,518
years to kind of get it right and the

997
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:42,859
local control agreement was an

998
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:44,868
absolutely essential part of getting

999
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:48,048
something done wasn't gonna happen

1000
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:50,000
without it and so over the future years

1001
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:52,639
there'll be a read abate and REE

1002
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,608
discussion and fine tuning but and it'll

1003
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:59,058
take a while but I think Reggie's right

1004
00:40:55,608 --> 00:41:01,940
when he says some my neighbor is buying

1005
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:04,519
it down the street and lives in this

1006
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,230
town why aren't why can't I buy it here

1007
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:08,959
so ultimately the economic

1008
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,670
logic prevails yeah thank you so friends

1009
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,530
this has been really fun let's do some

1010
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:15,220
questions I think Susan would like it if

1011
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:17,750
you line up is that what works for you

1012
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:19,519
Amanda great panel everyone thank you so

1013
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,619
much a lot of heavy hitters up here

1014
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:25,130
really appreciate everybody's work my

1015
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:26,780
question is for Locke here but I don't

1016
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,730
know if you're aware of a story that

1017
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:32,510
just happened two and a half weeks ago

1018
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:35,380
about a licensed transporter that had

1019
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:37,580
Department of Homeland Security seized

1020
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,380
230,000 dollars it's a case that mark

1021
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:41,599
Wasserman and Matt cuman are

1022
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,550
representing they're gonna be filing an

1023
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,730
injunction against the CHP who made the

1024
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:49,670
initial call now that you're a licensed

1025
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:52,039
distributor are you going to advocate on

1026
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,559
behalf of distribute distributors to

1027
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:57,500
ensure that the federal government does

1028
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:59,989
not continue to make this a new reality

1029
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,608
for the license industry or are you

1030
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:06,639
going to wait to your until you're the

1031
00:42:01,608 --> 00:42:06,639
next victim sort of a Hobbesian choice

1032
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:17,000
well I'm an advocate for the cannabis

1033
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:19,909
industry that's the right can I change

1034
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,659
the federal government know the voters

1035
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:22,659
hopefully will

1036
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:37,280
first of all my name is Michael Howard

1037
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:39,559
I'm with 3c cannabis consulting and I'd

1038
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:46,490
like to say that you're the best

1039
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:50,000
moderator I think I've ever seen so that

1040
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:54,169
was not a question my question is my

1041
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,210
question is I've heard rumors that

1042
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:58,430
there's going to be a second comment

1043
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:04,608
period for California for the

1044
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:07,598
regulations to become permanent so what

1045
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:12,679
would you say is one or two things

1046
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:14,539
particularly Aaron and has a kya one or

1047
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:16,940
two things that you really are sort of

1048
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:19,909
out of place or that you'd like to have

1049
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:24,349
tweaked to make permanent so the answer

1050
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:27,108
is yes she is the best moderator ever if

1051
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:29,390
there is a second comment process on the

1052
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:31,759
rules it will be limited in scope and

1053
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:33,289
the only reason that a second comment

1054
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,869
period would be triggered as if

1055
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:38,690
substantial significant changes are made

1056
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:40,970
to the rules that we all commented on

1057
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,639
before and while it's not actually

1058
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:45,980
statutorily required that comments be

1059
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:49,190
focused on those changes it's generally

1060
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,900
viewed that a second 15-day supplemental

1061
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,690
comment period would be focused on

1062
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,940
changes that have already been made the

1063
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:58,849
consideration of a next round of changes

1064
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:01,220
is likely to be deferred until the next

1065
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:03,680
rulemaking process so comment on

1066
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:05,899
whatever you like but really when we see

1067
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:07,789
the next draft of the regs look at

1068
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,710
what's changed and that should be the

1069
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:11,000
focus for those supplemental comments

1070
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:13,159
and we don't know what those things are

1071
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,429
yet because we haven't seen them 15-day

1072
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:20,088
one 515 one five-day is the Supplemental

1073
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:21,769
I believe I don't know tell you guys I

1074
00:44:20,088 --> 00:44:23,599
think that's it I think it's a 15-day

1075
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:26,599
supplemental if they make substantial

1076
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:31,338
changes just clarified thank you very

1077
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:34,068
much hi Joan Irvine we sponsor tech we

1078
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:36,349
do online youth safety you're talking

1079
00:44:34,068 --> 00:44:39,588
about delivery and this is really for

1080
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:42,019
Bill and Reggie just recently there was

1081
00:44:39,588 --> 00:44:44,690
a campaign stop wondering we

1082
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:47,210
by the California police chief

1083
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:50,240
Association in the League of Cities that

1084
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:53,000
are trying to use youth there was a

1085
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:55,429
cartoon with kids in front of and I have

1086
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,829
a copy of it at our booth kids in front

1087
00:44:55,429 --> 00:45:00,469
of a school and a marijuana truck there

1088
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:03,380
and this is coming out from the police

1089
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:06,889
chiefs Association what is it that you

1090
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:08,059
two can be doing to help them stop youth

1091
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:11,088
fear-mongering

1092
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:13,099
around youth recognizing that nobody in

1093
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:14,630
this industry wants youth to come into

1094
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:17,359
their store or be delivering to youth

1095
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,858
but I mean when I saw that I said I mean

1096
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:20,449
I just couldn't believe that they did

1097
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:22,429
this one of the things that this

1098
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:25,429
industry needs to do because you can't

1099
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:28,129
stop law enforcement from spreading what

1100
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:31,368
they believe is right and some of it can

1101
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,570
be pretty drastic what you see and they

1102
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:35,300
have to do that to catch your attention

1103
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:37,700
to make this industry needs to fight

1104
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,440
back I think men men now has an ad and

1105
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:42,348
not advertising for men men where they

1106
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,780
show regular people who use adult used

1107
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:46,550
cannabis I wish they had a politician in

1108
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,859
there too but they show nurses and

1109
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:50,630
doctors and teachers we need to let

1110
00:45:48,858 --> 00:45:53,509
people know regular people use it but

1111
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,800
more important for medical cannabis we

1112
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:58,310
need to let people know it's for

1113
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,410
veterans with PTSD for seniors with with

1114
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:02,358
arthritis and medical Aemon and for

1115
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:03,829
people with cancer we need to get that

1116
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:06,679
message out and we need to put our own

1117
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:09,880
money and you know it's probably not my

1118
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:12,799
money but at least you put your money

1119
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,640
it's some kind of advertising campaign

1120
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,320
to show the benefits of cannabis if

1121
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:21,319
otherwise the only voice they hear is

1122
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,510
that and we can counter we could make a

1123
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,150
unbelievable counter to to their

1124
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:29,359
argument that would just squash them to

1125
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:31,550
know in even an ad showing that this

1126
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,630
industry is not into having like ice

1127
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,519
cream trucks running through the

1128
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:36,289
neighborhood selling cannabis to kids so

1129
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:37,519
if anyone from Edmond is here sounds

1130
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:40,900
like the Assembly members offering to

1131
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:40,900
star in a political campaign for you

1132
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:58,219
hi guys do and thank you guys for coming

1133

1137
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:07,880
national television to ever use medical

1138
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,710
cannabis started a worldwide medical

1139
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,570
Murano movement for children a few

1140
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:12,889
things she said was pretty good but

1141
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:15,620
except for the kids do need it and I do

1142
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:17,299
want kids in my dispensaries you said

1143
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:18,889
education that's all I ever do

1144
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,330
I do support coops every single month

1145
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:22,819
for our veterans but not just that

1146
00:47:20,329 --> 00:47:24,679
also we feed them and give them medicine

1147
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,970
we have doctors chiropractors and

1148
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:28,429
everything and we're educating people

1149
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:29,689
bought cannabis I came here and I wanted

1150
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,019
to talk to you guys about two different

1151
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:32,300
things

1152
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:33,980
first thing is about regulations it's

1153
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,970
been a nightmare of course I think you

1154
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,219
guys need to talk to more the

1155
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:39,529
dispensaries and who's living it not

1156
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:41,089
just that the extraction facility's been

1157
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,740
a nightmare with the testing our

1158
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:44,210
patients need the medicine is life and

1159
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:45,559
death this is not a joke this is not a

1160
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:47,150
vape in this is life and death for

1161
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:49,250
children my youngest patient is two

1162
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:50,630
months old I had a 10 month old baby

1163
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,190
sitting out front of my store about

1164
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,300
three weeks ago we couldn't get the

1165
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:55,190
Jayden Jews fast enough because of

1166
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,930
testing having a seizure from the store

1167
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:59,030
I had one last bottle I to drive home

1168
00:47:56,929 --> 00:48:00,949
half an hour pick it up come back give

1169
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:02,900
it to a child because the testing and

1170
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:05,029
rules and regulations have ruined it for

1171
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,340
these families that are desperate for

1172
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,450
life-saving medicine so I think we all

1173
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:10,539
appreciate what you're doing you have a

1174
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:12,739
question yes I do

1175
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:14,119
well my first thing was a statement

1176
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:16,039
second thing is a question who's going

1177
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:18,289
to remember the the patients as we've

1178
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:20,500
been changing into this - from - 15 to

1179
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:23,119
64 the patients have been forgotten

1180
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,409
patients need medicine and it's getting

1181
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,969
very expensive and that's what I came

1182
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:29,539
here not just for the complaints and

1183
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:30,829
about the about the medicine but who's

1184
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,389
gonna help out the patients there's

1185
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:34,819
anyone who come gonna come out there and

1186
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:35,929
and help us out become a hero for the

1187
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,420
patients and need the medicine that

1188
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:40,639
can't afford it great great question so

1189
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:43,250
this year I worked with Operation evac a

1190
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:45,529
veteran's Kev's organization quality how

1191
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:48,079
for the campus compassion coalition on

1192
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:50,450
Senate bill 829 by Senator Scott Weiner

1193
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,710
that's the compassion bill senator

1194
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:53,848
Weiner was going to be here there today

1195
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:55,409
to go and give his talk

1196
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:58,259
on that in more detail but essentially

1197
00:48:55,409 --> 00:49:00,328
we want to be able to allow retailers

1198
00:48:58,259 --> 00:49:01,920
and allow all through the supply chain

1199
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:04,318
to be able to provide cannabis products

1200
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,869
to patients that have a recommendation

1201
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:09,568
not just an ID card and allow that be

1202
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:10,890
provide for tech provided tax-free so

1203
00:49:09,568 --> 00:49:12,659
that you would not be taxed on the

1204
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:14,608
cultivation you would not be taxed in

1205
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:17,129
the excise you would not be taxed on the

1206
00:49:14,608 --> 00:49:19,018
use tax so if you want to give the

1207
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,670
product away and that would be at a loss

1208
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:21,718
for the retailer but you would be able

1209
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:23,489
to do that without the government

1210
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:25,679
penalizing you so that was the first

1211
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:28,858
step on compassion and I think it was

1212
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,798
the first time really since you know we

1213
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:34,288
regret that in mikasa there wasn't

1214
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:37,679
strong protections for compassion and

1215
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:39,509
this bill is a very good step in a also

1216
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,818
very first step on it bringing

1217
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:47,458
compassion back to the legal regulate

1218
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:49,199
cannabis market um I'll say you know

1219
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:51,719
same as Mac's working on that bill

1220
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,608
demonstrated that patients aren't

1221
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:55,349
forgotten you know there was a vote out

1222
00:49:53,608 --> 00:49:57,538
of the legislature in both houses there

1223
00:49:55,349 --> 00:49:59,160
was a signature and so I think the

1224
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:00,989
political will is there I know mr.

1225
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:04,429
jones-sawyer and his colleagues very

1226
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:07,108
much do want to see patients have it

1227
00:50:04,429 --> 00:50:10,139
part of the frustration that I feel is

1228
00:50:07,108 --> 00:50:12,900
this sort of rush to establish

1229
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:15,118
profitable market when there are

1230
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,180
literally children dying for want of

1231
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,709
clean products and so you know I'm not

1232
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:22,108
gonna be that hero I don't know how I

1233
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:24,208
can do it but every one of you if you

1234
00:50:22,108 --> 00:50:26,190
are investing in if you're operating in

1235
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:29,129
if you're supporting the cannabis

1236
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:31,588
industry you have to not forget it's up

1237
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:33,989
to every single one of us to remember

1238
00:50:31,588 --> 00:50:36,208
what this plant has been for for the

1239
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:38,670
last thousands thousands of years we've

1240
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:40,018
used it the advancements I mean you know

1241
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:42,479
it more than me you see it every day

1242
00:50:40,018 --> 00:50:45,058
this is literally life or death for

1243
00:50:42,478 --> 00:50:46,978
children and we all need to remember

1244
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:49,920
that we all need to step up if you're

1245
00:50:46,978 --> 00:50:51,239
investing put 1% into advocacy the

1246
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,798
businesses can support their own

1247
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:56,068
advocacy they can pay for their own

1248
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:58,199
associations invest in compassion you

1249
00:50:56,068 --> 00:51:00,179
need to do it or else we're gonna keep

1250
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:05,219
talking shit I'll just be honest with

1251
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:06,649
you and so I I'm the I'm the first

1252
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:09,909
elected official to smoke

1253
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:14,150
cannabis in public but melissa etheridge

1254
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:17,389
and then Elon Musk did the same thing

1255
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:21,769
and caught hell but the point I'm making

1256
00:51:17,389 --> 00:51:25,879
is the reason I did it because I did it

1257
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:27,800
leading with medical cannabis Melissa

1258
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,660
Etheridge has cancer she uses it for a

1259
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,670
cancer treatment other than the

1260
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:33,259
pharmaceutical industry and that's what

1261
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:35,570
we were promoting and I think that's why

1262
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,330
I didn't catch a lot of I didn't catch

1263
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:40,309
any grief from that other than I think

1264
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:43,759
my my district is kind of cool with that

1265
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:46,880
but that's all another discussion and so

1266
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:49,430
I think we if we lead with the victims

1267
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,579
or the people who need it we will be

1268
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:54,649
able to to get other people even elected

1269
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:57,920
officials and others to say you know

1270
00:51:54,650 --> 00:52:02,090
what this is not a bad industry this and

1271
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:05,090
so if you do set aside 1% lead with

1272
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:07,250
medical show the victims not definitive

1273
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:10,100
show the patients that actually need

1274
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:12,079
this and show how the family members are

1275
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:14,779
much happier now and I think we will

1276
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,719
move a lot faster once we get rid of

1277
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:20,390
that that that that cannabis that

1278
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:23,000
marijuana madness kind of feeling if we

1279
00:52:20,389 --> 00:52:25,250
if we do that we'll be far ahead of

1280
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,320
anybody else so I think the question was

1281
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:30,380
does anyone want to be a hero Mac said

1282
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:33,500
sure me Taizo Hezekiah said not me

1283
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:36,340
Assemblymember said I'll do it and I

1284
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:38,809
think we're at 10:30 our next panel is

1285
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:41,600
do we want to do one more question yeah

1286
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:44,449
is there a pathway forward to develop on

1287
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,639
banking in California yet the board of

1288
00:52:44,449 --> 00:52:49,549
directors of banks that I speak to are

1289
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:52,849
operating out of fear they do not want

1290
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:57,410
to take on a target on their back from a

1291
00:52:52,849 --> 00:53:00,019
federal agency and the simple response

1292
00:52:57,409 --> 00:53:02,420
to me is why on earth would I put my

1293
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:05,809
bank at risk

1294
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:09,150
so that's a question is there an update

1295
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:13,140
secondly on the prior conversation about

1296
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:15,959
maybe governor Newsom how do we avoid

1297
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:18,568
this issue becoming the poster child for

1298
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:20,969
the polarization that now exists

1299
00:53:18,568 --> 00:53:22,739
throughout all politics the people on

1300
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:25,039
the other side of this issue governor

1301
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:28,469
Newsom rolls in to start advocating

1302
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:33,299
nationally for this easily can displace

1303
00:53:28,469 --> 00:53:37,499
the the real issues and get into just

1304
00:53:33,298 --> 00:53:39,028
inflamed partisan politics so I'm very

1305
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:41,518
concerned that even a well-meaning

1306
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:45,239
govern and Newsom is just gonna create

1307
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:47,338
what is an ignorant firestorm about what

1308
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:49,650
this issue is on the banking front

1309
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:51,389
you're absolutely right that this this

1310
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:52,920
is one of the symptoms of the the

1311
00:53:51,389 --> 00:53:55,498
conflict between federal and state law

1312
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,119
that that everybody in this room

1313
00:53:55,498 --> 00:54:00,868
probably deals with every day on some

1314
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,059
level we have seen that there is

1315
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:06,959
bipartisan support in Congress in both

1316
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:09,959
chambers but as for reforming banking

1317
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:12,239
laws that the money laundering statutes

1318
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:14,308
as well as Bank Secrecy Act to carve out

1319
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,708
an exception for state licensed

1320
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:19,650
businesses but as general Walker said

1321
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:23,788
government doesn't work very quickly I

1322
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:25,289
am of the opinion now that the banking

1323
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:27,059
issue will probably be resolved in a

1324
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:29,429
more of a comprehensive package like the

1325
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:30,509
states act at the federal level but

1326
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:33,298
looking to States and maybe

1327
00:54:30,509 --> 00:54:35,818
Assemblymember jones-sawyer can speak to

1328
00:54:33,298 --> 00:54:38,639
the state the the progress happening

1329
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:40,498
here in the state but again like has

1330
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,989
already been said everybody here if you

1331
00:54:40,498 --> 00:54:46,108
care about this issue it's time to

1332
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:48,329
invest in the policy reforms that aren't

1333
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:50,308
happening by themselves the reason that

1334
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:51,900
we took the banking issue from something

1335
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:54,449
that no hardly anybody knew about in

1336
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:56,939
Washington DC to buy something that has

1337
00:54:54,449 --> 00:54:58,709
bipartisan support and it's front and

1338
00:54:56,938 --> 00:55:00,478
center is because of the relationships

1339
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:03,558
that all of the the responsible

1340
00:55:00,478 --> 00:55:05,728
businesses allowed us to develop in DC

1341
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:08,670
I'll just say quickly you know in

1342
00:55:05,728 --> 00:55:10,288
addition to a share Erin's confidence at

1343
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:12,539
the national level for the first time in

1344
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:13,390
several years I think that things are

1345
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:15,849
going to move and

1346
00:55:13,389 --> 00:55:17,379
and kudos to NCI a for for moving in

1347
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:19,420
that direction and getting us in that

1348
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,369
position so we've got hope on the

1349
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:23,230
horizon at the federal level I also want

1350
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:25,599
to point to State Treasurer John Chung

1351
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:28,389
efforts with a cannabis banking working

1352
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,190
group over the last well previous year

1353
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:32,889
those have resulted in a couple exciting

1354
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:34,150
things I think that that maybe Tim will

1355
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:36,129
update you all on that a little bit

1356
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:37,900
later in the day but two things that

1357
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:39,970
came out of that process that give me a

1358
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,410
lot of hope first and foremost the the

1359
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:43,028
state treasurer's office is moving

1360
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:45,848
forward with a feasibility study on a

1361
00:55:43,028 --> 00:55:48,190
special state charter institution I'll

1362
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:49,869
say that it is already legal for banks

1363
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:51,639
to bank us they're just choosing not to

1364
00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:53,858
because of a risk calculation as you've

1365
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:56,199
mentioned I think that hopefully this

1366
00:55:53,858 --> 00:55:58,568
state charter will not create a state

1367
00:55:56,199 --> 00:56:00,818
bank per se but will give banks a higher

1368
00:55:58,568 --> 00:56:02,889
confidence lower risk profile and moving

1369
00:56:00,818 --> 00:56:04,389
into the space or better yet maybe a

1370
00:56:02,889 --> 00:56:06,248
group of entrepreneurs will seize the

1371
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:08,219
opportunity and create a bank through

1372
00:56:06,248 --> 00:56:10,389
that charter process specifically for us

1373
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:12,308
secondly there is now a multi-state

1374
00:56:10,389 --> 00:56:14,949
consortium that brings together local

1375
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:17,680
government state governments industry as

1376
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:19,719
well as the financial industry Aaron and

1377
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:21,368
NCIA are working with that group we are

1378
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:23,318
working with that group as treasurer's

1379
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:25,749
from Maine Illinois a bunch of different

1380
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:28,690
states and the goal is specifically to

1381
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:30,399
set legal States up to help that effort

1382
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:32,769
in DC and both of those things I think

1383
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,789
are new alignments of influence that

1384
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:36,368
didn't exist before

1385
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:38,109
- the second piece your question about

1386
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:39,608
polarizing I don't see cannabis as

1387
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:41,348
polarizing issue I've gotten high in

1388
00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:44,288
West Virginia I've gotten high in

1389
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:45,880
Oklahoma gotten high in Louisiana and I

1390
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:48,099
tell you what the reddest of the red

1391
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:50,798
counties and parishes like they're

1392
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:52,809
getting high too so I actually see this

1393
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:55,059
is probably more of like a highfalutin

1394
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:56,739
political pundit polarization the

1395
00:56:55,059 --> 00:56:58,960
American people aren't polarized on this

1396
00:56:56,739 --> 00:57:01,960
issue and if they are it's it's you know

1397
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,179
that generations polls are polls are

1398
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,829
consistently showing over 90% of the

1399
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:06,998
country supports medical cannabis yeah I

1400
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:09,190
don't think it's a polarizing issue

1401
00:57:06,998 --> 00:57:12,159
anymore and and it's getting less so

1402
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:15,940
every day and I think the real problem

1403
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:17,409
is fear and you know I I sleep with a

1404
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,048
banker she wears the Wells Fargo I know

1405
00:57:17,409 --> 00:57:21,429
how bankers think they don't lend you

1406
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:23,679
money unless they look at your credit

1407
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:25,480
report because of fear they don't take a

1408
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:26,618
chance on you they lend you money for a

1409
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,630
house unless you have collateral

1410
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:31,660
you've shown because of fear their fear

1411
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:34,210
that you will fail and so I get why

1412
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:35,828
banks don't want to move forward with it

1413
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:38,740
because in their nature and their

1414
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:43,150
business practice is based on risk and

1415
00:57:38,739 --> 00:57:45,219
reward and the risk is you lose

1416
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:48,278
everything all if they could just seize

1417
00:57:45,219 --> 00:57:52,980
everything and no individual banker want

1418
00:57:48,278 --> 00:57:55,509
to do that there is a discussion and let

1419
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:59,079
the cattle but there's discussions with

1420
00:57:55,509 --> 00:58:03,248
about four or five western states about

1421
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:04,720
starting a bank of their own and then

1422
00:58:03,248 --> 00:58:08,949
how the federal government try to shut

1423
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:11,139
down a multinational State Bank and then

1424
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:13,778
we fight them as a group and they're all

1425
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:18,929
the West you know Washington or in

1426
00:58:13,778 --> 00:58:22,088
California and let's let's do that and

1427
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:24,759
see what happens and see if we can we if

1428
00:58:22,088 --> 00:58:27,159
we collectively push back on that and

1429
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:29,498
then then it's our money we put in our

1430
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:31,719
money from different states investors

1431
00:58:29,498 --> 00:58:33,759
who are willing to take that risk to

1432
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:38,679
make that happen so there is discussion

1433
00:58:33,759 --> 00:58:42,608
but to pull the trigger is still f.e.a.r

1434
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:44,618
it's not just a book it's real friends

1435
00:58:42,608 --> 00:58:46,929
thank you very much our next panel is

1436
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:47,530
the realities of california's cannabis

1437
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:49,519
economy

1438
