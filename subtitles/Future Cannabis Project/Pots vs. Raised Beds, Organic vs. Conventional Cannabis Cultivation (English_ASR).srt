2
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:21,000
I've experienced better yields and

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,839
production capabilities consistency with

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,539
pots in greenhouses versus beds run

5
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,539
couple acres of each for a couple years

6
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:45,539
see and that's the stress of the

7
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,520
environment of a pot but beds for me

8
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,800
being a soil producer and a soil guy

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,030
produces super soil called big roots big

10
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:56,218
roots is all tested a non GMO pesticide

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,660
free there's no contaminants tested for

12
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,579
heavy metals things that the industry

13
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:03,390
aren't even isn't even talking about yet

14
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,000
but for me a super soil is a product

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,680
that you can plant you can get your life

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,629
out of it you can you add your

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,330
beneficials and add more biologics to

18
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:16,379
the soil which actually eat up the

19
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:18,478
minerals you know digest any kind of

20
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:21,179
pumice stone that's in my mixes you know

21
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,950
all that stuff it's eating it's eating

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,840
and producing its own environment so

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,320
once you create in me this is my opinion

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,390
on beds versus pots in a greenhouse beds

25
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,399
once you start creating that living soil

26
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,560
out of a first-year soil and you have a

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
right medium to actually put down in in

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,750
you have to add less and less and you

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,299
create more of an beneficial environment

30
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,670
which produces a lot better plus I

31
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,259
really believe in the communication of a

32
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:52,228
plant I know that communications through

33
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,549
terpenes are benefi beneficials microbes

34
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:55,530
they communicate through terpenes

35
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,649
terpenes through pheromones right

36
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,180
through the sense same with the roots so

37
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,399
the roots are actually talking to each

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,140
other when you have one plant yeah when

39
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,299
you have one plant going and what in

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,950
roots are going past they can they might

41
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,750
not be able to find what they need in

42
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,640
that pot at that time but when their

43
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,479
roots are three feet away in a plants

44
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,279
you know

45
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,259
even that big but the roots are even

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,370
bigger than that plan they're searching

47
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:19,739
for their needs and they have a

48
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,930
free-flowing method that they can

49
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,599
produce their own environment and to get

50
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,489
the same results so when you're saying

51
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:45,870
and I agree with you we're all in this

52
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:47,009
together so I'm not a hundred experience

53
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,959
the difference

54
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:50,699
then what your experience which is cool

55
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,709
because we are different cats on the

56
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,208
same dream hammering it down the only

57
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,549
thing I don't like about beds in a

58
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,949
greenhouse or even with pots in a

59
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,170
greenhouse is in the wintertime on my

60
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:04,048
last run going from the late winter into

61
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:07,199
early spring I always like to bring pots

62
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:09,060
in and put pallets or something over the

63
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,459
top of the beds to keep that root zone

64
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,530
off the ground because when the soil

65
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,959
conditions drop below it's pulling that

66
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,609
that coldness the roots won't grow if

67
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,289
they're not in the right kind of

68
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:22,019
temperature naturally and that's where

69
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:24,659
rolling beds come through rolling tables

70
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,639
you eliminate walkways yeah and I just

71
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,799
find that your production per square

72
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:32,489
foot goes dramatically up with the pots

73
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,980
rolling beds and agree I totally agree

74
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,620
with you you know it's a it's a hard one

75
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:39,000
[Music]

76
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,980
so what this is what I've learned in the

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,539
last few years and I do a lot of in

78
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,578
Saudia we do greenhouse drones so we're

79
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:48,000
a couple we're a couple homies handling

80
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:50,400
business right in a greenhouse in

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,829
greenhouse environment what was I gonna

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,650
say oh so what I've learned instead of

83
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:59,340
doing less numbers in pots when even on

84
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:03,329
my indoor environment I do less or twice

85
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,280
the amount of numbers half the amount of

86
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,859
veg time and I flip like into my

87
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,299
greenhouses I put my plants in right and

88
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:12,239
I flip within 10 days immediately

89
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:15,629
flipped I produce smaller plants more

90
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,489
yields more consistency and my weights

91
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:20,548
my yields everything the time like

92
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,589
instead of doing three runs possibly

93
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:24,629
hard to do three runs in a greenhouse in

94
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:25,369
a season I can hammer out even easy for

95
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,430
because

96
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,590
my flipping time is now you know gone up

97
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:44,930
a lot like I'm using a lot less time to

98
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:47,839
produce more yields I don't deny the

99
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:52,400
microbe factor and here's where it there

100
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:54,198
is a moral it's more

101
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,509
maybe it's an ethical dilemma I'm not

102
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:01,129
100% sure I've always been an organic

103
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:05,060
guy and I've liked organics I have found

104
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:07,819
that the UI could get higher yields with

105
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,530
using the salt fertilizers and all this

106
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:11,478
and to me a plant doesn't really care

107
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:14,689
whether it's organic food or non-organic

108
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:16,668
food I got a different and so will what

109
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,800
where is that where is the difference

110
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:20,990
can you show that your animal test I

111
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,360
could show it in your terpene test and I

112
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,000
can show you that but enjoy being tested

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,038
I've done essential oils for a long time

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:37,639
for my whole life I teach at this school

115
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:42,860
in Santa Cruz de brillo college in

116
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:44,930
California and sit down anyways but I've

117
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,740
had access to this GCMs machine and I've

118
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,579
seen multiple years of data that

119
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:55,550
correlates an organic crop a

120
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:58,839
conventional crop and a hand-picked crop

121
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,400
and this is all not cannabis but

122
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:03,500
consistently throughout the years the

123
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,888
conventional farms have put out a more

124
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,800
diverse terpene profile than the organic

125
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,689
farms and mainly I think because the

126
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,300
deliverance of nutrients and as great as

127
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:16,250
the microbe web can be it's not always

128
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,920
giving the plant what it wants every

129
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,589
moment of

130
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,640
and when conventional you can do that

131
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:26,009
you're basically just giving them little

132
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,479
and and and the ethical dilemma

133
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:31,680
generally face would be is

134
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,720
denitrification in the soil etc etc you

135
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,120
know water pollution run offs but when

136
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:40,530
you can mitigate those situations with

137
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:43,230
runoff trays into recollecting and just

138
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:45,089
kind of I mean that is a responsible

139
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,879
part of the ethical punch but there's no

140
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:50,879
ethical backing in conventional farming

141
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:53,129
in my eyes it's just it's well just in

142
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,689
those to me where the dilemma lies if

143
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:56,579
you are producing something that gives

144
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:59,629
good run off clean runoff then you

145
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:02,039
should be runned off that's it but

146
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:04,170
generally there's low runoff you don't

147
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,879
necessarily need a high runoff you don't

148
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:09,810
but in conventional farming you're

149
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,490
utilizing if not double even more times

150
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,819
the amount of water on our drain to

151
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,120
waste

152
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:17,040
scenario I haven't necessarily found

153
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,680
that to be the 100 I need to get you

154
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,480
some big roots oil I really do and we're

155
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,759
just moments away from each other so I'm

156
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:31,890
gonna hook you up

157
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:34,170
and I want you to hi it's anyways I

158
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:38,579
think the data to me that I've what I've

159
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:40,379
seen yeah the college has been that the

160
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,479
conventional farms did actually put out

161
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:45,180
a better terpene profile yeah I'm not

162
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,770
saying I know but I would love to sit

163
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,449
down with you now that is hard for me

164
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,609
because I would like to say oh sure the

165
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:52,800
organic is better yeah you know I'm here

166
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,319
to say the organic is better the organic

167
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,150
is better I'm here saying that I'm not

168
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,099
yeah yeah I know he's not denied but I

169
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:03,139
I'm just playing the devil's advocate a

170
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:07,410
little bit because I what I have seen is

171
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:09,449
higher yields and and so now if I have

172
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,480
employees coming in every day and my

173
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,459
greenhouse is using a certain amount and

174
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,740
I'm running heaters and I'm doing all

175
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:18,969
this stuff employees are coming every

176
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:22,310
day and so there is a you know

177
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,650
sustainability kind of like what about

178
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,899
the living organism the beneficials that

179
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:29,149
are that are destroyed by conventional

180
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:31,459
farming 'sm let's just talk about a

181
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:36,110
plant welfare okay let's talk about

182
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:38,418
plant welfare one this is a beta test I

183
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,070
did on a hundred plant outdoor with

184
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:42,710
conventional and a hundred plant with my

185
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,650
organics this is a what a story I tell

186
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:48,500
all the time is I this was about ten

187
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,509
years ago nine years ago I did two

188
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,190
plants studies and and I always believed

189
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,720
organics and I was pushing it back then

190
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,640
you can probably verify though than

191
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,240
Santa Cruz not many people were pushing

192
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,710
any organic movement is Santa Cruz but

193
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,899
not many people back then were really

194
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,050
buying into it and I was ninety percent

195
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,340
sure I was on the right path then all of

196
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:09,019
a sudden I wanted to prove it to myself

197
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,879
because I'm a high drama store owner

198
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:13,009
your garden center I'm calling hydro I'm

199
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,590
a garden soil King garden center same

200
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:18,769
thing and on those two patches that

201
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:21,980
Krulak I grew conventional farming and

202
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:25,370
then organic farming at first going into

203
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:29,000
about July this conventional plants were

204
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,159
bigger they're about 20% bigger than my

205
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,470
organics and I started telling myself

206
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:35,179
maybe I'm fucking wrong maybe I missed

207
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,879
this boat maybe I'm selling me a ticket

208
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:39,979
that I can't buy into anymore what I

209
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,439
found out is that it started getting an

210
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,930
end of July into August and I'm having

211
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,240
root problems I'm having diseases root

212
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:48,979
I'm having plant diseases the winds are

213
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,539
coming these plants are falling over I'm

214
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,060
staking the hell out of it there's

215
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:55,159
spindle e same genetics as this one

216
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:59,479
these ones are steady the race steady

217
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:02,419
the race right harvest comes probably

218
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,460
lost you know good 10% of these plants

219
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:07,129
these plants are still running the gamut

220
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,379
running stone this finishes ape quality

221
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:12,110
this finished @cb at best

222
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:14,240
I got about we've figured out 17% more

223
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,580
yield on the organic than we ever did on

224
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,139
a conventional farming and the product

225
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,450
was sought after more Powder Mill do

226
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,389
everything and what I

227
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,150
I've come to realize is that your plant

228
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:26,949
needs its own biological system it needs

229
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:28,269
its own system to ward off and fight

230
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,890
diseases to pests

231
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:32,079
everything that's going on it and when

232
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:34,720
you eliminate that structure starting

233
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,180
with a healthy soil you eliminate the

234
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,370
plant putting off its own pheromones for

235
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,929
when certain bugs come an attack on the

236
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,029
out on the outdoor not so much into work

237
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:45,159
as a controlled environment you know and

238
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:47,110
you start you start messing with its own

239
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:49,179
and natural environment then all of a

240
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,690
sudden you run into more issues diseases

241
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:57,159
different problems coming on right and I

242
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:58,690
think you can also keep a plant happy in

243
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:01,629
many different ways yes it's a good

244
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:04,390
point you know love it's more like yeah

245
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:06,189
the organic and for long season you have

246
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:07,960
a bigger buffer because you're slowly

247
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,030
breaking down all these nutrients and

248
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:17,680
you're creating the life for all the

249
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:25,319
microbes and I almost think it's almost

250
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:25,319
more challenging you're mixing more

251
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:39,340
we're manipulating it instead of letting

252
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,629
it's biology biology manipulate it right

253
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,639
when a plant needs something that goes

254
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,259
to talk to the biology I need this what

255
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,460
it can't really the communication

256
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:47,169
between us and that plan on the

257
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,759
conventional is of different aspects you

258
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:51,819
really got to be on your game you do

259
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,970
yeah it's awesome man awesome give me a

260
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,970
hug

261
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:03,580
you

262
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:03,579
