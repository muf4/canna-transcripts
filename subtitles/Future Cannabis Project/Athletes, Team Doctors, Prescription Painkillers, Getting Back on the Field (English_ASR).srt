1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,770
we don't have UFC like teams of doctors

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,359
that prescribe stuff to us you know we

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:11,609
have our own personal doctors it's not

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:14,518
organized I guess like like the NFL

5
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:16,739
teams for example but even you know my

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,320
father who's a physician it just they're

7
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,729
very quick - what do you need for paint

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,839
okay here you go there's here's the

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,329
vicodin here's there's percocets and

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,839
it's it'd be nice to get people to kind

11
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:32,640
of change their perceptions and I think

12
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,738
you know you know Michelle was talking

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,689
about what education sometimes it

14
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:40,349
doesn't work on people you know I agree

15
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:42,439
with that but I also think that it helps

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,910
as well you know educating people on

17
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:47,459
really what are the benefits you know

18
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:50,069
what is going to happen if you use

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,469
cannabis is your life going to be over

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,789
are you going to be really lazy or you

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,280
know a lot of people just have these

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,280
crazy perceptions and crazy ideas and

23
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:03,929
you know everything pretty much and I

24
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,728
think education is key doesn't work on

25
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:07,618
everybody people are gonna believe what

26
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,349
they're gonna believe but I I do think

27
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:12,569
there's a lot of benefits to it and you

28
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:15,390
know it just it's forms like this that I

29
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:19,139
think will hopefully help and educate

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,180
people I think is monumental for UFC

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,189
fighters MMA in general because you guys

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,509
have a fight here and then the next

33
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:26,279
fight is not for what six or seven

34
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,439
months sometime people take more fights

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,829
in the year but I mean in doing that I

36
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,809
think masking pain while training so if

37
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:35,219
you get injury and it prevents you from

38
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,469
training for about five days that five

39
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,590
days is huge because their fights coming

40
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,670
up and with NFL we had like 16 games and

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,719
you know you can come out and

42
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,290
somebody'll go in for you there's

43
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,670
backups

44
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,549
there's no backups and fighting so you

45
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,170
got to do it all yourself and that I

46
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,720
mean that right there in of itself just

47
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,759
it shows the power I can you said a lot

48
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:57,000
of people are getting sponsored by CBS

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,709
now because it actually works and I see

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,569
athletes are benefiting from it I know

51
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,669
some of the fighters that are sponsored

52
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:05,279
that are taking CV deters say that it's

53
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,930
monumental for just joint pain I mean I

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,788
imagine getting into the ring and you

55
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,530
run and roll on the ring and jujitsu and

56
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,589
your

57
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,959
knees are aching I couldn't do it no and

58
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,479
it's a great point you know not to say

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,400
it's easier necessarily but you know in

60
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,099
the NFL if you're not able to play on a

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,870
Sunday you know you wait and you're able

62
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,269
to to play the next Sunday and you're

63
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,560
good your contract kind of guarantees

64
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,840
you a certain amount of money not the

65
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,849
case in fighting if you're not able to

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,379
go that Saturday night well good luck

67
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,539
maybe you got to fight another three

68
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:37,818
months or maybe you don't and a lot of

69
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:39,759
times you don't and that's the only way

70
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:42,139
you're really going to get paid

71
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,209
sponsorship has changed significantly in

72
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:46,669
the UFC there was a time where you know

73
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,890
it kind of looked like you had NASCAR

74
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:50,988
shorts you had sponsors all over now you

75
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:54,949
can't really do that there's other ways

76
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:57,140
to go about those sponsorships but you

77
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:58,810
know that that's that's it that's all

78
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:01,039
you got so if you're not able to fight

79
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,989
you're not getting paid you're not able

80
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,989
to pay the bills and a lot of guys are

81
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:09,050
dealing with a lot of pain and have to

82
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:10,310
fight with with major injuries if you

83
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,329
have to go up in a weight class I think

84
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,329
that kind of is good he'll probably yeah

85
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,329
exactly
