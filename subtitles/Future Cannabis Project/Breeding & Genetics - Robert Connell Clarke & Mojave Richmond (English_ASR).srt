1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
[Music]

2
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:09,388
first of all how long have you guys

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,009
known each other like when did you did

4
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:14,939
you first meet and like the Amsterdam

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:18,719
scene yeah that Noster Dome in 1993 or

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:21,960
393 somewhere around yeah and and what

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,489
was the scene like back then like who

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,480
were some kind of the people you were

9
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:31,559
running with in the well I moved to

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,659
Amsterdam actually I originally just

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,539
planning on touring around Europe and I

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,539
stopped off in Amsterdam first but Adam

13
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,679
Dunn who later form th seeds he's an old

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,429
childhood friend of mine of them

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:47,070
virtually all my life so he had been in

16
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,570
option ahhm for two or three years at

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,730
that point and he was like hey you got

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,378
to come over you're an old old-time

19
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:54,448
cannabis guy you're gonna love it here I

20
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,448
thought I'd go check it out for a couple

21
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:59,070
of weeks maybe a month or so I think I

22
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:04,079
told my family and friends that I'd be

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:08,310
gone total for a month minimum maximum a

24
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:10,349
year and I'd end up staying for six so

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,820
yeah and I was gonna travel all around

26
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:17,158
Europe and I just traveled through you

27
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:19,500
know Netherlands Belgium and then France

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,609
and then decided to come back to

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,310
Amsterdam and stay there for the

30
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:25,799
remainder of the six years and what in

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,650
kind of the early to mid nineties was

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,200
the state of genetics cuz people always

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,659
talk about I always view it like jingis

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,140
Caan has kind of you know he spread his

35
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,900
seed all over the world and like Dutch

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:41,640
genetics have kind of cross pollinated

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,700
with all the land raised so what was

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:50,280
going on in Amsterdam like what were you

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:53,728
seeing back in the early to mid 90s well

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,200
I look at Rob because a lot of what was

41
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:57,750
in Amsterdam at the time were the

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,640
pivotal varieties that came from

43
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:06,149
California and ended up such as such as

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,368
Hays skunk one Northern Lights which

45
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,489
didn't come from California but from the

46
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:12,960
West Coast West Coast afgan one Durbin

47
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,210
poison

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,670
early girl you know plants like that

49
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,920
we're so Durbin poison came into

50
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:22,079
Amsterdam not through South Africa but

51
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,949
through kind of people growing it in

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,910
California

53
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:31,949
it actually was collected by Ed

54
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:34,770
Rosenthal years ago in a coffee shop in

55
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:36,750
Amsterdam okay and then those seeds came

56
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,310
back to America things were selected

57
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,680
here and multiplied and then ended up

58
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,479
back in obstacle so he grabbed them in

59
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,219
what decade decade that would have been

60
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:50,209
the mid-70s okay and then started

61
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:53,400
growing in California because I know

62
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:56,460
with Jim Goodwin who fell Frank who

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,569
ended up being the keeper of those seeds

64
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:03,060
and what were you doing at this time I

65
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:06,419
was in 93 I was working with Hardy farm

66
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,170
and developing things that ended up

67
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:12,119
being used by GW Pharmaceuticals okay

68
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:15,629
yeah that was the aim at that point just

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,060
beginning harder for me you grew up

70
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,370
where because Adam was lived in

71
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,289
Jamestown Rhode Island for a while Adam

72
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,920
did live in Jamestown for a while Adam I

73
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:28,009
believe was born in Woodstock New York

74
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,559
and I was born in Big Sur California

75
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:35,459
kind of on the opposite ends of the same

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,460
spectrum and his family moved to

77
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,909
California when he was a young young

78
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,400
baby and that's where we met and I grew

79
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:50,210
up in a cannabis community you know the

80
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:53,520
Big Sur was a kind of a beatnik artists

81
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:58,230
enclave of people who had gone back to

82
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,450
the land to do their thing and it was

83
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:03,269
cannabis was definitely the one thing

84
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:05,609
that kind of connected the entire

85
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,520
community you know whether there were

86
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:12,690
musicians or artists or cultivators or

87
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,010
poets or communists or hippies or

88
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,810
whatever you know it was definitely

89
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:18,358
cannabis was the connective thing and it

90
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,759
was definitely a part of my life from

91
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:24,240
the beginning right and then what about

92
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,740
you Rob where did you grow up I was born

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,019
not far from here in Del Mar California

94
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,478
you're a California boy oh yeah I went

95
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:33,579
to school UC Santa Cruz and that's kind

96
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:36,788
of where it all began for me got it and

97
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:40,568
so when when you both first were playing

98
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:46,149
around with genetics what like NorCal

99
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:48,939
what 80s and SoCal probably I don't want

100
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:51,339
to date you but like late 60s in the

101
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:55,120
early like so I went to school and UC

102
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:57,489
Santa Cruz in 1971 okay and I did

103
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,110
actually technically I did grow up in

104
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,819
Southern California I spent most of my

105
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,479
formative years in Southern California I

106
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:06,129
left Big Sur as a fairly young child

107
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:09,068
moved to New York City and then back

108
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:12,418
over to the west coast and I first

109
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:20,430
planted my first seed of cannabis in

110
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:24,788
1983 which would have been some Big Sur

111
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:27,430
developed african hybrid that was pretty

112
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:30,310
popular at the time malawi based thing

113
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,800
that was definitely what one of the

114
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,629
first i mean it was the first plant I

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,490
ever grew but it was also an imprinting

116
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:38,560
kind of moment where it was like the

117
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,569
smell and the effect associated with

118
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,718
those first early plants that I

119
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:45,189
experienced definitely shaped what I was

120
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,259
looking for in cannabis for the

121
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,908
remainder of my life because that was

122
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:51,580
kind of the period when it changed from

123
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:55,300
in the late 70s or early 80s where those

124
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:57,788
early narrow leaf varieties started to

125
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,418
get hybridized with more Afghani based

126
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:04,029
stuff and is that something that you

127
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:08,978
still are breeding or find today or is

128
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:10,689
it been lost I'm still I think what what

129
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:12,668
it is is I'm still breeding towards

130
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:16,598
those goals but I think in many way I

131
00:06:12,668 --> 00:06:19,000
mean it's hard to say what what we

132
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:21,579
thought cannabis was in the past and how

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,918
we're trying to you know achieve those

134
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:25,990
same effects or traits or whatever

135
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,120
because it's a memory at this point

136
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,360
unfortunately we don't have analytics to

137
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:35,399
go back on but there's always been a

138
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,560
certain effect that I felt was most

139
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,229
interesting for me and

140
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,168
the Afghani kind of base stuff was just

141
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:48,509
never that interesting so I've always

142
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:51,339
kind of been chasing that that type of

143
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:55,659
narrow leaf variety and and trying to

144
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:57,909
improve their agronomic capabilities by

145
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,770
figured crossing them with things that

146
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,020
maybe are a little bit more early

147
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:03,899
flowering and higher yielding and stuff

148
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:05,918
like that but it's definitely the

149
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:07,299
effects side and I still see it today

150
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,439
when I encounter people's land

151
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:13,360
race-based stuff it's definitely the

152
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,649
what I like to consume the challenge is

153
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,930
always looking at it and going wow how

154
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:18,549
can we bring that to the market how can

155
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,280
we bring these things that I think a lot

156
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,790
of people really desire from cannabis to

157
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,168
the market and in a way that we can make

158
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,319
it happen because I do think that

159
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:35,349
everyone appreciates those older those

160
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:38,620
varieties and what about you I also

161
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:42,789
really appreciate landrace sort of

162
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:46,240
cannabis everything's become with the

163
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:48,189
exception of the aromas involved all the

164
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,250
cannabis today is frightfully similar

165
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:53,740
and that's really what most people are

166
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,259
used to unless you were exposed to

167
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,610
cannabis 20 years ago you never really

168
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:01,029
had much of an idea that there's so much

169
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:04,090
diversity possible but but when you're

170
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:08,049
talking about landrace strains or

171
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:09,788
cultivars today can you give me some

172
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,800
examples of some stuff you've come

173
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:13,449
across recently and who has them and is

174
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,610
it something that that person had like

175
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:17,918
seeds that they forgot about from the

176
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,350
70s or that they've been breeding it

177
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,659
diligently for the past like they've

178
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,120
been the the stewards of those genetics

179
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,000
for the past thirty years or a little of

180
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,660
both I think there's a few seed

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,360
companies that have been championing

182
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,250
land race-based genetics and have

183
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,320
continued to provide those so people can

184
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,778
still go out there and find things land

185
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,120
race based because it's not a land race

186
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:45,250
once it leaves the region and the

187
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,879
geography and the people that created it

188
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,379
so but know there's there's some new

189
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,269
stuff that I've seen that have come from

190
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:54,419
seed companies and also a pheromone

191
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:58,389
stuff that just came from those

192
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:02,559
custodians of their old varieties and

193
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:04,389
they're yeah they're they're unique but

194
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,099
they're not unique they're they're just

195
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:08,649
great cannabis varieties that make you

196
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,790
feel good and and have a lot of positive

197
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:14,919
attributes that you know that people

198
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:17,379
seem to enjoy it's it's it's always been

199
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:20,229
a discussion of you know I think from

200
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:22,299
the original hybridization of these

201
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,120
narrow leaf and broad leaf varieties to

202
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:27,069
now I think people really appreciate the

203
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,519
effects associated with what we call

204
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:32,890
sativas and it's always this marriage of

205
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,289
you know can you get a farmer to grow it

206
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:38,919
versus all my friends who want to smoke

207
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:41,709
it you know and it's a compromise and

208
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,809
that's what we've been doing for decades

209
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,700
is making these compromises but those

210
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:48,009
original land race-based varieties that

211
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,290
were imported from around the world they

212
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,879
were all very unique and different each

213
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,730
one of them because there was no they

214
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:58,480
were all came from a very far off land

215
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:00,909
where they solicited yeah but but

216
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,519
specifically what who are some of the

217
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:05,919
the breeders or people who like recently

218
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,539
you've come across you have some of what

219
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,929
you're talking about I'm not really

220
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:14,169
known breeders more more old friends

221
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:17,259
that have the similar ethos in terms of

222
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:19,209
like I'm willing to grow varieties that

223
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,700
take a long time to flower and yield

224
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:24,370
very low and are hard to sell and doing

225
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,550
that for decades at a loss in order to

226
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,110
maintain what they believe is high

227
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:30,969
quality cannabis and what people should

228
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,009
be smoking needless to say a lot of

229
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,019
those people are not commercial growers

230
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,100
right that's just not their main if they

231
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:38,889
really want to make a bunch of money

232
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,129
they grow the same thing as everybody

233
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:46,000
else grows but a little bit different

234
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:49,419
well I mean you just sit on kind of the

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,440
California regulated market and kind of

236
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:55,029
like love and you know like the fact

237
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,490
that some stuff takes much longer to

238
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:00,189
flower right like it's we're in a market

239
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,560
where it's like yeah but a turn stuff

240
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,630
over quickly and yeah but that's also

241
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,579
partially because we haven't the market

242
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:10,570
hasn't matured enough to appreciate all

243
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:12,280
the the full spectrum of possible

244
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,520
products that you can make from cannabis

245
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:18,539
I mean I think that in to draw a

246
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,460
comparison to wine which is often not

247
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:24,909
necessarily accurate but if you think of

248
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:28,200
how California looked at wine production

249
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:31,480
in sales 30 40 50 years ago

250
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,030
they wanted to grow a lot and they

251
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,159
wanted to sell it for cheap and they

252
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:37,809
wanted to provide you know as much as it

253
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,350
could to as many people as possible and

254
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:44,439
the idea of boutique wine and and wine

255
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:46,690
that had been aged and wine late harvest

256
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,490
wine and dessert wine and all these

257
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,860
things that we now realize that there's

258
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:55,360
a there's a consumer that will

259
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,769
appreciate every possible right you know

260
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,090
there's the hundred dollar bottles of

261
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:00,039
wine there's thousand dollars of bottles

262
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,990
of wine there's $5 $2 bottles of wine

263
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,939
and with cannabis we're right in the

264
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,539
middle of that commodity specialty

265
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:10,000
market where it's all the specialty

266
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:11,949
products are all bound to the commodity

267
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,570
market so they can't really break

268
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,300
through that ceiling and say you know

269
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,610
what this is a really low yielding late

270
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:20,709
flowering variety but it is so amazing

271
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,690
you're gonna have to pay the farmer the

272
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,340
equivalent of what they'd make on a low

273
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,350
yield a high yielding early flowering

274
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,210
variety but I do believe that'll happen

275
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,670
once people get to experience them and

276
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,379
appreciate the difference what well I

277
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:34,089
think another bottleneck is on the

278
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:36,669
farmer's side when you're thinking about

279
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:40,060
you know producing for the regulated

280
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:42,549
market you know if batch size testing is

281
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,989
50 pounds and you're producing less than

282
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:46,179
that but you're still incurring the same

283
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,830
cost and then you have to you know all

284
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:50,169
the costs associated with being

285
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,670
regulated those people are probably just

286
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:54,699
staying out of the market right now it's

287
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:56,949
yeah they have great stuff that I would

288
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,620
love to smoke but it's not gonna be on

289
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,600
the regulated market anytime soon right

290
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,779
because you as a consumer haven't

291
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,210
convinced the commercial producer that

292
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:09,730
you're gonna pay more for it yet so it

293
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:12,220
definitely regulation has driven these

294
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,710
eight nine-week varieties to to capture

295
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,259
the entire market you know where we used

296
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,339
to have you know people used to grow

297
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:20,318
outdoors and

298
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,240
grow big giant super Silver Haze plants

299
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:23,528
that took forever to grow but they

300
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,430
figured out a way to make it profitable

301
00:13:23,528 --> 00:13:30,399
and they were able to supply but now

302
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:31,989
it's a production era you know that

303
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,009
we're trying to ramp up production and

304
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,818
figure out how to turn this into

305
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:38,350
agriculture instead of horticulture and

306
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:40,328
the first thing that you look at are

307
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,149
things like yield and flower time and

308
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:45,248
stuff like that but but once I mean in

309
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,688
just a backtrack to the Netherlands what

310
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:48,339
one thing that I thought was just really

311
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:51,578
interesting and made it work there's

312
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:54,339
that they had almost every coffee shop

313
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:58,109
had a menu with two sections they had

314
00:13:54,339 --> 00:14:02,410
high or four sections actual hydro bio

315
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:04,389
indica sativa and and you're they paid

316
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:08,708
more of a coffee shop would pay a

317
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:10,600
cultivator more for an organic sativa

318
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,948
because they knew they said look we need

319
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,839
to have this product on the shelf

320
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:16,058
because people want it and the only way

321
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,970
you use a cultivator can justify growing

322
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:20,919
it is if we pay you more and this was

323
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,499
stuff that was growing greenhouses or

324
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:25,058
what was a greenhouse was an indoor but

325
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:27,909
it was just basically acknowledging that

326
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:29,919
haze for instance was just not something

327
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:32,740
you could grow in these big chunky sea

328
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:35,229
of green production models and that it

329
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:39,188
was probably the most desirable cult of

330
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:41,678
Harr in the entire city so how are they

331
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:43,088
going to pull it off the menu when it's

332
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:44,909
what everyone wants well the only way to

333
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:48,999
keep it on the menu is to pay the the

334
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:49,749
farmer more still on the menu and it's

335
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:52,659
still there

336
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:54,220
and it still costs more yeah and you can

337
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:57,039
buy a is easier and I'm strong and you

338
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,990
can buy it here yeah so that's just a

339
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,049
more mature market as well obviously

340
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,990
well I feel like Amsterdam also has

341
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:07,058
taken what I would consider some wrong

342
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,938
turns recently so can you talk about

343
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:12,308
kind of the Amsterdam which was the

344
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:16,419
mecca of cannabis consumption and and

345
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:18,219
the scene how it kind of bungled like

346
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:19,688
what have you seen in Amsterdam I mean

347
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,139
what was the last time you were there I

348
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:25,240
was there in 2018 in the summer and that

349
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:27,970
was the first time I've been back in 13

350
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,339
years and I was surprised to see that

351
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,860
little had changed that they didn't

352
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,430
embrace they've all

353
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,610
and the Dutch were really good with

354
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:40,759
looking at things from a social policy

355
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:43,620
angle and so they didn't really look at

356
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:46,409
cannabis from a supply chain production

357
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,470
side and so they never really created a

358
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:51,389
robust system that could grow so I go

359
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,480
back to Amsterdam 13 years later and if

360
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,949
you buy up gram of cannabis and they

361
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,810
pull out a Tupperware and they shake it

362
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,430
all up and look at it and then pull it

363
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:01,919
out and squeeze it and cram it into a

364
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:04,439
little ziploc bag and take a sharpie and

365
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,419
write haze on it you know and I'm just

366
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,850
like wow like we're in California we've

367
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:10,500
got all this manufacturing and

368
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,350
production and all these different vape

369
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,089
pens and pre-rolls and and they just

370
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,070
suck now we're just keeping it the same

371
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,690
way they're not trying to make it happen

372
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,740
and now they're looking at actually

373
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,940
creating an actual system that might

374
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,209
accommodate more of an agricultural

375
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:31,920
model and I can only imagine the coffee

376
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:33,389
shops and the patrons are nervous how

377
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,729
about on the cultivation side because

378
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:38,549
the Dutch are known for their ability to

379
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:42,629
grow massive amounts of fruit vegetables

380
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:45,509
and agriculture in general where are

381
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:48,028
they on cannabis cultivation using their

382
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:51,110
domain expertise of agricultural

383
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:54,419
production I don't think they've really

384
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:57,199
looked at that you have to remember that

385
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:59,698
all this was done by turning a blind eye

386
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,349
it was legal to sell cannabis in a

387
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:03,059
coffee shop it was not legal for that

388
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,890
coffee shop to buy cannabis and they

389
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:06,568
cannot claim it on their taxes so it's

390
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,850
never been part of the business

391
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:11,159
structure now they're talking about it

392
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,649
now they're talking about how limiting

393
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,350
cultivation to only a few growers to

394
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,939
supply the coffee shops whether this

395
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:20,369
will happen or not I don't know but

396
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,319
that's presently what they're talking

397
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:25,349
about

398
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:26,730
that won't be good for consumers they're

399
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:28,469
suddenly won't be anybody who's going to

400
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,480
be growing a haze because that I really

401
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:33,140
won't care and then you're gonna have a

402
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,970
situation that will be the final blow to

403
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,980
the diversity they used to experience in

404
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,390
coffee shops they're right I mean when I

405
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,110
first went there they were imported it

406
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,020
was imported cannabis and what was it

407
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:48,529
mostly coming from the US mostly

408
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:50,059
freaka Africa okay and since um from the

409
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:52,069
Caribbean and South America and all the

410
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:55,490
normal supplies of stuff we had but

411
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:58,399
closer to that from Africa was a kind of

412
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:02,720
land race oh all of it and so what

413
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,030
countries was it malawi South Africa all

414
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,180
the subdivisions of southern Africa

415
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:11,450
essentially it was yeah it was mostly it

416
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:15,350
and then what are kind of today some of

417
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:18,259
the most intriguing kind of cultivation

418
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:20,829
regions in your opinion like what are

419
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:27,440
you keeping tonight like Colombia

420
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:29,689
different parts of Africa well any of

421
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:35,930
those places if somebody's far enough

422
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:39,950
from present-day reality that they

423
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:44,750
somehow missed out on growing spook then

424
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:49,789
yeah great but it's gone going landrace

425
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:51,619
collecting those why bother I mean if

426
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:53,659
you really know somebody is way off in

427
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:57,409
the top of the reef mountains somewhere

428
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:59,960
and it's possible I suppose but when you

429
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,440
get on Instagram sites today and you see

430
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,490
Afghan guys in Afghanistan growing

431
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,190
California varieties you're like it's

432
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,799
done you know it's done findell ato

433
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:13,370
the last place landraces really came

434
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:16,009
from was Afghanistan I mean no late

435
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:17,509
seventies they were the last ones to

436
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:19,129
kind of come on the block other ones

437
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:22,069
have come along since but nothing that

438
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,960
wasn't there already it's been reef you

439
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:27,230
know refueled a bit over time in the 80s

440
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,210
but since then good luck so basically on

441
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,069
the mountainsides of a lot of these or

442
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:34,039
in the valleys or whatever you're seeing

443
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:38,409
kind of blue dream and purple punch and

444
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:40,430
I was in Morocco last year and it's a

445
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:47,330
it's incredible really

446
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:49,519
I mean I was there in late 70s no early

447
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:52,849
eighties and and it was still mostly the

448
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,730
traditional narrow leaf tall keith

449
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:57,149
plants which they made you know zoom

450
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,089
Toshi's from but

451
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:04,860
not now you don't see those at all and

452
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:08,669
it basically looks like indoor or

453
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:11,969
greenhouse grow except the building's

454
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,590
gone I mean they're all it looks like

455
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,069
fields of cuttings there you generally

456
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:19,079
not they're generally all female seed

457
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:20,909
varieties but they're quite you know

458
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,319
inbred to make that happen a bit and

459
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,300
they're very uniform you can see

460
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,730
differences in blocks of so many seed

461
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:30,389
versus somebody else's but the next year

462
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,799
people won't be buying so much female

463
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,259
seed and there's still plenty of males

464
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,609
around so it's all full of seed which

465
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:37,079
makes the buds even look fatter and more

466
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:40,289
amazing than they actually are cuz

467
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:44,039
they're chock full of seeds but but

468
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:45,960
they're yes just bizarre there's a drip

469
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,899
tubing everywhere and always identical

470
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,370
or compliance and nothing's more than

471
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,500
four or five three or four feet tall

472
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:54,539
most of them you know six feet it'd be a

473
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,420
big plant you can see over the top we've

474
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,639
always filled yes so historically in the

475
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:02,370
seven all is when you go to those fields

476
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,380
there'd be to look our camp fields right

477
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:06,928
today really close together and just a

478
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,330
lollipop as we call it on top of a stick

479
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:14,340
that was it just one big bud one coulomb

480
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:16,710
no branches maybe well like turkey today

481
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:19,230
went our Hempfield said about 30 plants

482
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:25,009
to a square metre square yard

483
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:27,450
approximately 35 maybe so yeah it's not

484
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,799
not pretty much room in there you can

485
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:34,679
squeeze in between I hope you want to

486
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:40,740
walk through it but yeah so can can you

487
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:43,559
talk about you know on Instagram people

488
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:46,289
always talk about pollen shuckers versus

489
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:51,170
breeders and so can you you just kind of

490
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:54,720
talk about your approach to breeding

491
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:58,950
yeah well what makes a breeder of

492
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,390
breeder in your opinion where you where

493
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,360
you personally would call someone a

494
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,970
breeder like what are what's either like

495
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,949
an academic rigorous I mean no I don't

496
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,799
think so I don't think that's fair I

497
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,200
think it's the intent

498
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,700
you know more I mean for instance I

499
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,340
talked to a friend of mine recently who

500
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:23,789
who was the guy who popped the original

501
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:25,859
Sour Diesel seed you know and I was

502
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:27,359
gonna write something up for him for a

503
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:28,439
magazine and I said look I want to write

504
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,959
something up for you you're the breeder

505
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,180
of sardines he's like whoa whoa I didn't

506
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,400
make the cross I'm just the guy who put

507
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:39,779
the seed in the ground I rely to say who

508
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,480
that is no necessarily we can get into

509
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,549
that another time but but he put the

510
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,860
seed in the ground and there's there's

511
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,450
there's you know consensus amongst all

512
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:49,949
the people who were involved in that

513
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,930
plant that he is the guy who put the

514
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:56,100
seed in the ground and where was this in

515
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:58,710
upstate New York okay and but he wasn't

516
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:01,589
the breeder so he didn't really breed

517
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,390
that variety but he did make it he was

518
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,769
the steward he was the custodian he's

519
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,860
the one who made it happen he deserves

520
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:09,210
all the credit and get me wrong but I

521
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:12,059
guess what a breeder is to someone who

522
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,039
has some intent to actually create

523
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,710
something like I'm gonna do this in

524
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,849
order to make that and I'm gonna

525
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,710
thoughtfully take something from here

526
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:21,269
and something from here and this is what

527
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,069
the outcome I'm either trying to achieve

528
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:25,799
or maybe I'm trying to achieve some

529
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:28,649
unknown outcome it's different than just

530
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:30,599
letting the pollen fly at will and then

531
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:34,920
just selling seeds it's a little

532
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:37,619
different you know yeah but but at the

533
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,620
same time that being said as far as I

534
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:42,299
know all of the modern varieties the

535
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,819
amazing modern cannabis varieties that

536
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:46,529
we've smoked over the past decades all

537
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:49,470
came from someone who just had a few

538
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:52,139
seeds that fell out of the bud that they

539
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:56,160
had in a bag all of them there hasn't

540
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:59,550
been an amazing cannabis plant that was

541
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:04,410
developed by a true breeding program by

542
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:07,500
a PhD cannabis breeder right so there

543
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:11,759
are but they're not in our drug cannabis

544
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,839
world right no twenty of plenty of plant

545
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,309
breeders who could have been working

546
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,049
with weed or cotton or anything that

547
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:19,500
worked with cannabis but they're

548
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:21,409
basically hemp breeders you know but and

549
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,150
people have done some medicinal breeding

550
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,630
generally it's seeds that fell out of a

551
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,300
back

552
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,730
whether the bag came from a brick from

553
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:32,639
Columbia pencil and race or whether it

554
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:35,130
is a bag seed from something wasn't

555
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,650
supposed to have seeds in it which is

556
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,030
most common right and they made

557
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,380
additional crosses with that I'm not

558
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:42,149
saying that they just pulled it out of

559
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,560
the seed out of the bag but it wasn't

560
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:48,810
under a big breeding program that was so

561
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,730
so the smallest the the smallest little

562
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:53,700
operation some guy who has four lights

563
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:55,349
or a little backyard grow those are the

564
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,960
guys who produced all the most amazing

565
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:59,879
genetics that we consume for you know

566
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,789
recreational or medicinal purposes like

567
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,170
if you think of any variety I mean

568
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:05,759
they're all just came from small growths

569
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,039
that's why we're at this precipice now

570
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,269
where we have all this all these

571
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:12,480
varieties that have been developed some

572
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:14,910
of a really amazing and valuable and now

573
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,789
we can actually improve upon them with a

574
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:21,720
little bit more of an advanced and you

575
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:24,119
know larger approach to greeting so

576
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,430
that's that's the future but right now

577
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,529
it's still where we are right so so we

578
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:32,490
touched on it for a little earlier but

579
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:35,549
can you talk about your intent and what

580
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:38,549
you're trying to create my intent was to

581
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:39,930
stay with one line has always been to

582
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:42,680
that there was just like I mentioned

583
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:45,180
earlier that there was this kind of this

584
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,830
white whale that I was chasing something

585
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,289
that you remember from your youth yeah

586
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:51,629
absolutely 100% and I remember I

587
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:54,359
remember it and then I remember losing

588
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,280
it and then finding it again and once I

589
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,289
found it again I decided like well I'm

590
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:59,609
just gonna breed this I'll try and

591
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:01,589
improve it but I'm not going to try and

592
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:05,339
create a bunch of different varieties

593
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:08,250
with with a with a bunch of diversity of

594
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:09,689
flavors and and different fee knows that

595
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,430
people can kind of just you know what's

596
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,559
the fee know what's the strangers you're

597
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:16,250
coming from this breeder I really wanted

598
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,509
to stick to the Sage line so that

599
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,930
everything that came out of it really

600
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:23,789
felt like sage and whether they were

601
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:25,380
slightly higher more seen varieties that

602
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:27,569
could be maybe slightly it's a data

603
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,160
version of sage or higher to appealing

604
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:31,319
varieties that were more energetic and

605
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:36,870
focusing that it would just be along

606
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:38,460
that line and for about 20-some 24 or 25

607
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:40,139
years I've pretty much done that

608
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,480
where I haven't really introduced much

609
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,080
so every time I would introduce a new

610
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,640
cross I would work through that over a

611
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,679
number of years before I introduced

612
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,330
another cross just to give an example of

613
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:56,340
something that you introduced and what

614
00:26:51,329 --> 00:27:02,039
you are looking to accomplish yeah

615
00:26:56,339 --> 00:27:03,929
well the most I guess the most distinct

616
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,569
difference was when I came back from am

617
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:10,350
from Amsterdam to California and tooth

618
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:12,569
in 1999 and I was good friends with Josh

619
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:15,569
D and that whole crew and they

620
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:17,189
introduced me to OG and I saw some

621
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:19,919
things in that plant that were really

622
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,259
valuable in terms of breeding such as

623
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,740
what

624
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:28,829
well marketability honestly yeah that

625
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,140
was a big part of it I mean it's it's a

626
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:33,000
powerful plant it turns up the octane on

627
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,860
a lot of other when you cross OG with

628
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,039
things it definitely turns up the volume

629
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:40,799
a little bit and into 11 it goes to 11

630
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:42,930
mate yeah but um and I always felt sage

631
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,779
was just fine and plenty it was enough

632
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,910
for me but when people were smoking a

633
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,470
lot and getting into dabbing and stuff

634
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,450
like that doing concentrates people

635
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:55,140
really want a strong variety of cannabis

636
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:59,100
so I crossed oh gee with sage and then

637
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:02,520
had a sage OG male that I crossed back

638
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:06,299
to sage and that produced a variety

639
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:09,389
called zeta which to me had the majority

640
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:12,089
of the sage based effect in attributes

641
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:14,400
but it had a little bit of the bag

642
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:18,599
appeal and slightly earlier flowering

643
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,190
period of OG and that helped a lot you

644
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,759
know it definitely made a more

645
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,730
marketable

646
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,349
variety you know but um but I still

647
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,210
missed the old sage at that point that

648
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:30,209
was also when I didn't save enough of

649
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,160
the old seed and con went down this line

650
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,529
diverged along this path and didn't

651
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,269
maintain what I really was into which

652
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:38,819
was which was kind of the lighter I

653
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:40,920
almost view it as like the light version

654
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:42,179
right you have like the one that packs

655
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,490
the punch which is the one that's

656
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:49,690
crossed with og and then the original

657
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:52,929
which is yeah like a wine versus a yeah

658
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:55,360
killer shot absolutely and and just more

659
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:58,090
focused and energetic and a little bit

660
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,769
um you know kind of weed you can smoke

661
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:01,418
all day and it's still strong enough

662
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:04,269
that if you smoke enough of it you get

663
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:07,360
you know and have you gotten back there

664
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:10,388
or are you still trying to get the less

665
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:15,158
I did I did get back there a little bit

666
00:29:10,388 --> 00:29:18,638
through selfing and going into that

667
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:20,950
actually I brought back some more a sage

668
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:24,250
Paul a sage mail that I crossed against

669
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:27,759
that sage OG cut and diluted it just

670
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,769
enough to parse out a little more of

671
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:33,878
that those og characteristics but still

672
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:39,849
have some of those bag appeal and then

673
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:42,428
is the ultimate goal to once you where

674
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:44,888
are you in terms of creating the sage of

675
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,389
your dreams are you there I mean

676
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:48,668
obviously you can always keep on

677
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:50,648
iteratively bringing it in directions

678
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:54,429
but you have something right now that is

679
00:29:50,648 --> 00:29:58,689
like this is a masterpiece for my

680
00:29:54,429 --> 00:30:00,009
personal taste yeah kind of I mean close

681
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,288
so definitely you could I mean you could

682
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:05,278
always improve things I guess but at

683
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:07,538
some point you have to settle you know

684
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:11,319
but yeah I have a variety that I call

685
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:14,528
holy which is kind of at one point the

686
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:16,778
there was Big Sur genetically Holies in

687
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:19,388
the sage family right like is is your

688
00:30:16,778 --> 00:30:23,079
whole mo like everything's gonna be some

689
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:24,548
sage yes yeah this and I'll explain that

690
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:29,918
because there's a lot of confusion

691
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:32,528
around that but in the seed stock that I

692
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,409
used to make sage was from partially

693
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:37,538
from Big Sur and in Big Sur there was a

694
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:39,549
variety that was known called Big Sur

695
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:41,798
Holy Week from the late 60s and early

696
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:45,308
70s and Big Sur holy weed was

697
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:47,259
predominantly Mexican and there was

698
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:48,548
pretty at one point everything grown in

699
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:50,889
Big Sur was called Big Sur holy weed

700
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:53,019
because it was the way to you know add

701
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:57,099
an extra couple hundred bucks on a pound

702
00:30:53,019 --> 00:31:00,278
I guess but so but the variety that I

703
00:30:57,099 --> 00:31:03,109
use to cross into sage was actually a

704
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:06,859
African variety but it was grown in bigs

705
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:09,259
and in the 90s when I was in Amsterdam

706
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:11,029
and just quickly by African since it's

707
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:13,940
obviously a big continent is this like a

708
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:16,099
southern Appalachian City and and are

709
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:19,840
those on the same parallel as where you

710
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:25,279
were in Big Sur like the the southern

711
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:28,548
equatorial equivalent of your no no I

712
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:32,599
think it would it would be know a little

713
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:34,639
bit I'm not sure so microclimate it

714
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:38,058
wasn't kind of mimicking the northern

715
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,350
kind of reflection of I don't think so

716
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:43,009
okay I don't think so I don't know how

717
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:43,819
important that was I mean yeah it's a

718
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:45,980
good question though

719
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:48,589
but um but anyway there was African

720
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,950
genetics in that original sage and I was

721
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:54,769
born in Big Sur and at one point seeds

722
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:58,160
were sold as sage times Big Sur holy

723
00:31:54,769 --> 00:32:00,168
wheat so there there was this kind of

724
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:04,298
misconception that there was original

725
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:10,580
Big Sur holy wheat genetics in sage and

726
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:12,289
while exploring different crosses sage

727
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:13,819
crosses I did find something that did

728
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:17,779
really remind me of some of that early

729
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:20,298
Big Sur holy weed a fact that high

730
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:23,629
terpene alene kind of Acapulco gold like

731
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:26,690
a fact and I called it Big Sur holy or

732
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:28,669
holy and just because it reminded me of

733
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:32,120
the homeland it had that knows and that

734
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:34,790
that feeling of of way back and that to

735
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:36,168
me is just what I enjoy smoking and

736
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:38,298
everyone who tries it seems to think

737
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:39,140
it's just a really nice really nice

738
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:44,329
plant to grow

739
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:45,860
would you agree with that but you could

740
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,269
make it you can improve on it I mean

741
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:49,819
it's a late flowering variety and if you

742
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:51,558
could get that same effect in a nine or

743
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:53,720
a ten week flowering plant then you'd

744
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:55,399
have something really special so that's

745
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,110
an example of something that you're now

746
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,960
focused on is how do i shorten the

747
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:02,599
flowering time of this yeah as much as

748
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,250
possible without compromising the and

749
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:06,859
what would be some strategies to get

750
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,480
like would you cross it was specific

751
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:11,659
like you have your eye on specific

752
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,549
cultivars to cross it with no probably

753
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,110
my next move if I was trying to improve

754
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:16,009
that line would just be a larger

755
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:18,109
selection

756
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:20,720
to try and put out enough seeds that you

757
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:23,919
could get hopefully something that was

758
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,559
earlier flowering okay so as a breeder

759
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,390
what's kind of you've created cultivars

760
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:31,940
that you love you think other people

761
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:35,660
will love what's what's your next move

762
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:37,759
is it to sell seeds is it to sell clones

763
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:42,230
is it to flower it out yourself and

764
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:45,079
create a brand it's to all the above

765
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:49,610
into some extent not really in the seed

766
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:51,109
selling business never really have never

767
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:52,519
bought seeds actually just recently

768
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:59,679
bought my first hundred dollars worth of

769
00:33:52,519 --> 00:34:03,019
seeds from some land race provider but

770
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,269
no the next goal is to get these plants

771
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:08,269
what I think have value in commercial

772
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:11,119
growers hands and to try and figure out

773
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:12,829
a marketing strategy to teach people how

774
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,638
to appreciate these varieties and to

775
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:19,369
teach you know retail outlets how to

776
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,860
sell them and teach consumers how to

777
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:24,349
request them and you know I think it's a

778
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:26,240
big topic that where the whole industry

779
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:28,639
is kind of experiencing and we kind of

780
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,029
used the word landrace to kind of

781
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,250
describe it but there's there's this

782
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,429
interest in these heritage lines that

783
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,230
have either just a point of difference

784
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:42,200
which is really important well you're

785
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:45,260
trying to establish a brand or they have

786
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,779
really do have a different effect that

787
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,870
people can notice you know and I think

788
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:53,149
that that's an important part of this

789
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:54,739
stage of our industry is consumer

790
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:57,019
awareness and like once people get to

791
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:59,889
experience it and really not just smoke

792
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:03,800
it once at a party but actually have a

793
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:06,589
retail that provides them on an ongoing

794
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,630
basis then they will come back and say

795
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:10,340
no I demand it you know and I'm willing

796
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:13,640
to pay more and tell the farmer to grow

797
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,860
more and you know it almost needs a push

798
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:18,559
and pull strategy right like that yeah

799
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,539
the pull coming from consumers coming in

800
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,730
and asking for what do you have that's

801
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:26,000
unique and not the hype strains and

802
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:29,960
maybe land race and then the push of you

803
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,920
know farmers willing to grow it on us

804
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,070
you know and then get it through the

805
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,079
distribution system and yeah well back

806
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:39,119
to the wine thing you know Northern

807
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,739
California grew a lot of hi Northern

808
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,960
California in Central Valley grew a lot

809
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:45,149
of high yielding wine grape varieties

810
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,970
there were high sugar high yielding

811
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:52,470
varieties and they were well established

812
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:54,389
you know Mendocino County and Sonoma

813
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:55,879
they grew a lot of Zinfandel for

814
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:58,440
instance and some of those vines were

815
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,789
really old and produced a lot and

816
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,920
established and Hardy and they remember

817
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:07,170
the White Zinfandel thing in the 70s

818
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,599
these two press red grapes to issues

819
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:12,150
yeah and they would no contact with the

820
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,250
skin so they'd make this white wine from

821
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,108
a red grape it's very popular in the

822
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:19,858
early 80s I'll have a white zinfandel

823
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:22,259
and but it was crap wine it was really

824
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:24,389
bad and right at that same time people

825
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,830
were learning about you know Burgundian

826
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:29,400
style Pinot Noir

827
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:31,409
you know growing Pinot Noir grapes but

828
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,059
then producing them in this in the style

829
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:35,399
similar to how they do in Burgundy in

830
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:36,858
France and as soon as people got a taste

831
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,389
for that they're like are you kidding me

832
00:36:36,858 --> 00:36:40,980
this is good stuff my drink in this box

833
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:43,108
wine right and then but what do they

834
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,559
have to do they have to cut down acres

835
00:36:43,108 --> 00:36:48,029
and acres of Zinfandel producing and

836
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,639
then plant a little thing that doesn't

837
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:52,589
even yield any fruit for years in order

838
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,049
to wait for the market to mature and

839
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:57,239
wait for the consumer to ask for that

840
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,680
bottle take a bunch of steps back to

841
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:00,629
take a bunch of steps forward

842
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,159
well agriculture requires foresight I

843
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,070
really believe that you know that you

844
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:07,618
have to say and it's not the consumers

845
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,510
fault or the farmers fire fault it's

846
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:13,470
that we have to have this feedback loop

847
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:17,190
this push and give and take that creates

848
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:20,868
those demands and you know that's part

849
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:23,338
of our job as cannabis historians and

850
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:24,838
aficionados is to say hey there's

851
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,940
varieties out there that we think are

852
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:30,838
really interesting and you might all

853
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:36,570
appreciate I actually have a question

854
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:39,000
for you guys as breeders and like moving

855
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,039
from the from the point of that most of

856
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,360
the breeders or the the strains that

857
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,090
we've been smoking in love

858
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,550
from small producers growing those four

859
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:51,200
six or ten plants how do you maintain

860
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:56,010
the integrity of your genetics when you

861
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:58,529
scale up and what's the most important

862
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:03,270
thing about that process is it

863
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:06,120
consistency is it like wine that each

864
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:09,300
year might be different do you want to

865
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,400
maintain control of the cultivation

866
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,920
process do you let the genetics out of

867
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,280
your hand and trust other cultivators to

868
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:25,829
take care of what you've created how do

869
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:28,860
you think about that that's a lot yeah

870
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:31,409
well well I mean I asked because because

871
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:35,370
like I've been asking for years how like

872
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:37,739
the the crafter boutique cannabis you

873
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:39,359
know industry like I've been asking this

874
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:42,139
question for years and the answer I get

875
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,940
back from industry marketing people is

876
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:47,429
in all industries you have to create

877
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:50,639
your mass market first and then out of

878
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:52,500
that comes a craft industry which means

879
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,859
that the craft and boutique as we know

880
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:59,280
it now has to go away and and that is a

881
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:01,380
tragedy of unknown proportions to

882
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,820
someone like me who goes way back and

883
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:08,519
never stopped consuming cannabis I never

884
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,430
stop so I have the long memory as well

885
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:14,250
of those of those old of the of the old

886
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:15,839
strains and the old genetics and I miss

887
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:18,510
a lot of that stuff too and I'm like

888
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,039
well how are we gonna get ha how are we

889
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:22,830
gonna get from here to there if we have

890
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,690
have to wipeout does that have to happen

891
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:26,130
I mean I'm not I'm not saying you guys

892
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:29,610
have but that's why I ask these

893
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:33,630
questions because it is really important

894
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:36,710
to a lot of people that we continue to

895
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:39,150
have those types of experiences and not

896
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:42,269
you know wind up with cannabis that is

897
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:43,800
all the same so you know and but you

898
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:45,480
know when you talk to big market or is

899
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,130
there like nope that's not how it works

900
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:52,409
in today's world right there right it's

901
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:54,000
not how it works but we have a little

902
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:55,129
bit different circumstance part of your

903
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,239
question was

904
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:04,110
how do you keep the quality up well like

905
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:05,669
wine grapes or hop comes for that matter

906
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,740
these are perennials you know they're

907
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,599
they're vegetatively reproduce they're

908
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:11,729
identical to each other unless something

909
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,759
should happen to them pick up a virus or

910
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:16,530
something so that's three equality comes

911
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:21,510
from your beer consistency will come

912
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:24,150
from from variety now they're exactly

913
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:26,400
right that the industry is gonna be you

914
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,740
know five varieties or something or five

915
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,110
different types let's say then there's a

916
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:34,500
few varieties of each that are

917
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:35,340
economically feasible to grow but the

918
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,309
other ones they're not going to

919
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:41,100
disappear they're still in people's

920
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:43,170
backyards and garages and they'll still

921
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:44,610
be around and people still know about

922
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,680
them because people will still share

923
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:49,200
with their friends so they'll be there

924
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:50,219
and slowly I don't think the craft side

925
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,279
will go away

926
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:57,149
it's gonna be tough and it's gonna have

927
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,519
to live and another guys the softer part

928
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,289
of the regulatory market somehow none of

929
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,809
these little people are gonna get big

930
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:05,279
fat licenses to grow six plants to keep

931
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:07,199
something alive they'd only grow six

932
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,390
plants anyway you know so what's this

933
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:12,029
what's the deal so I think we have a

934
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:14,489
little a little better chance of

935
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,930
preserving things I give you a little

936
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:18,119
example of grapes too I worked in

937
00:41:15,929 --> 00:41:20,730
Hungary for years the Soviet system

938
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:25,440
basically did their very best to rip out

939
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:27,150
every traditional Hungarian Friday and

940
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,780
they did very well they grew these white

941
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:32,579
sour green sort of grapes that they

942
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,190
wanted for the export market to Russia

943
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:37,949
that's all he cared about but as soon as

944
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:39,539
the shackles were taken off it bounced

945
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:40,919
back immediately because they went

946
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:43,139
around and they went to everybody's

947
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,519
backyards where they did not get every

948
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:46,739
vine because they only ripped out the

949
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,530
commercial ones and they brought back

950
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:52,979
their wine industry in just a few years

951
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:55,890
really fast so and we're in cannabis

952
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,320
were in dog years so hopefully we are we

953
00:41:55,889 --> 00:42:00,420
are experiencing this like as we could

954
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,910
become a more agricultural model we are

955
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,380
seeing the craft being challenged

956
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:07,170
although we never really had a craft

957
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,730
cannabis market the way craft alcohol

958
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:13,108
works but that's for a number of reasons

959
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:15,539
but hopefully we'll push through this

960
00:42:13,108 --> 00:42:16,920
period really quickly we're actually

961
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:19,279
working with the group now called

962
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,460
breeders best which is that's a big

963
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,170
focus on that company is that there's

964
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,838
this opportunity there's a there's an

965
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:32,180
opportunity in that transition that to

966
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:34,798
kind of save varieties and to help

967
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:36,618
commercial groups see the value in

968
00:42:34,798 --> 00:42:39,210
varieties whether it's their unique

969
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:40,920
terpene or cannabinoid profiles or

970
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:43,130
agronomic traits that make them

971
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,568
desirable is appellation a part of the

972
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:49,559
scheme

973
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:52,469
well appellation is is it's a word that

974
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:55,349
it means a lot in you know appellation

975
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:58,798
has a lot to do with mandating certain

976
00:42:55,349 --> 00:43:02,130
cultivation practices and certain

977
00:42:58,798 --> 00:43:04,230
varieties and stuff like that yeah yeah

978
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:06,210
it's a lot well well I think that we

979
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:09,510
won't have the ability to utilize

980
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:12,329
Appalachian and terroir the way the wine

981
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:14,579
industry is until we settle on things

982
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:16,109
like varieties and figure out where the

983
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:18,059
market is for a while so caffeinated

984
00:43:16,108 --> 00:43:19,769
soil you're using yeah it's about a

985
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:22,079
point of difference is saying one

986
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:25,079
appellation versus another one terroir

987
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:29,010
versus another is about showing that I'm

988
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,960
I grow in you grow in in Napa you grow

989
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:33,540
Pinot Noir but just because I grow it in

990
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,730
Sonoma I'm in a more coastal appellation

991
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:37,679
which has different influences on the

992
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:39,750
grape therefore it's a more acidic and

993
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,429
it's a lighter blah blah blah so you can

994
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:44,789
use that as a marketing strategy but you

995
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:46,529
have to both grow Pinot Noir to be able

996
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:48,869
to do that you can't just all just say

997
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:50,640
hey I grow whatever I want and then I

998
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:52,318
throw it in an appellation and that has

999
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,389
some type of a marketing strategy to it

1000
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,338
it doesn't really work that way you

1001
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:59,969
think French wine and how you're really

1002
00:43:56,338 --> 00:44:01,650
bound by structuring varieties with an

1003
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:04,500
appellation in order making a marketable

1004
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:06,269
product you can't just wiggle around

1005
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,818
that oh that's great we got to tie down

1006
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:12,539
the varietal end of the appellation it's

1007
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:14,548
right to wild on the icy mix you can't

1008
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:17,338
grow Sangiovese in bordeaux and call it

1009
00:44:14,548 --> 00:44:21,018
a bordeaux period you can call it French

1010
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:24,828
wine so there's all different ways

1011
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:26,958
a police right gets shot for that I mean

1012
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:30,079
as you well know you know the the

1013
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:32,808
difference in elevation in a distance to

1014
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,339
the coast all those factors are real and

1015
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:36,169
really do make a difference

1016
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,838
sure so it seems like the potential

1017
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:40,728
really is there if there's a little more

1018
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:45,068
discipline there's yeah and there has to

1019
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:47,958
be a structure so you have to be able to

1020
00:44:45,068 --> 00:44:49,489
point out those differences and if it's

1021
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:52,278
just a different variety grown every

1022
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:54,559
year for instance no one can compare how

1023
00:44:52,278 --> 00:44:56,648
it's grown if nobody realizes like hey

1024
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:01,009
you know what I've been smoking this

1025
00:44:56,648 --> 00:45:03,380
this wedding cake in Carpinteria versus

1026
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:05,179
this wedding cake in Solvang and they're

1027
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,979
so totally different they have to be

1028
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:08,329
there so we have to settle on what

1029
00:45:06,978 --> 00:45:10,129
varieties are grown and how we're

1030
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:12,199
marketing those varieties in order for

1031
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:14,479
people to learn about Appalachian and

1032
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:17,719
terroir and then eventually it may be

1033
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:19,968
that wedding cake doesn't grow near the

1034
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:21,889
ocean very well so it's gonna be grown

1035
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:24,769
in solving because it's outside of the

1036
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:26,658
fog belt and that's others are agronomic

1037
00:45:24,768 --> 00:45:31,148
considerations that will come to bear as

1038
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:34,278
well and people didn't go to hump

1039
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:36,648
originally in the 70s people did not go

1040
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:38,389
to Humboldt County to grow cannabis they

1041
00:45:36,648 --> 00:45:41,598
were back-to-the-landers they found

1042
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:44,809
cheap disused and abused largely land

1043
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:47,499
and they you know brought it back and

1044
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:50,119
made really lovely homesteads and

1045
00:45:47,498 --> 00:45:53,448
financed this whole process by growing

1046
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:55,130
weed all right and when Mojave says

1047
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:57,949
there never really was a boutique

1048
00:45:55,130 --> 00:46:00,079
industry there wasn't it was an illegal

1049
00:45:57,949 --> 00:46:01,398
industry and everybody was a boutique

1050
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,679
grower there were smaller ones the

1051
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:06,588
larger ones but now you've got guys with

1052
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:09,889
ranges of greenhouses they're acres and

1053
00:46:06,588 --> 00:46:12,199
illegal and and you're not gonna compete

1054
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:16,568
with that you're gonna be part of the

1055
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:18,858
system that we're where you can fit in

1056
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:21,079
but the pricing and everything you kept

1057
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:23,838
these people going was strictly the

1058
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:27,589
prohibition base that there's no real

1059
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:29,599
economic you know reality in it so

1060
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:32,509
everybody's having to restart as far as

1061
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,360
that goes so when you guys breed now do

1062
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:36,849
you breed for

1063
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:39,789
do you create with do you go I'm gonna

1064
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:42,670
make something that I like that I want

1065
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:44,489
or just or their market considerations

1066
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:47,289
in mind as well

1067
00:46:44,489 --> 00:46:52,539
where's both I mean you know it's I

1068
00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:53,860
forget what the the there's it's false

1069
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:55,300
to make the assumption that just because

1070
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,519
you like it other people like it as well

1071
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:00,370
and a lot of people make that that that

1072
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:01,840
um that mistake but I do think that you

1073
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:04,179
know you have to start with whether you

1074
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,039
like it and then you try it out and if

1075
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:09,519
other people like it too then you're

1076
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:11,949
onto something and you know it used to

1077
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:14,050
be that all good cannabis was good

1078
00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:16,149
cannabis and everyone liked everything

1079
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:21,490
to a certain degree and now it's really

1080
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:24,760
about finding your consumer base what

1081
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:28,599
demographic likes what and if you can

1082
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,100
kind of pair those two things together

1083
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,360
then there's a there's potential for

1084
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:36,250
just a lot of different varieties in a

1085
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:39,460
lot of different applications but it

1086
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:41,139
really if you miss that and you develop

1087
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,710
something that you really like for

1088
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:48,039
reason X but you don't convey that to

1089
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:50,289
the consumer then they're gonna miss it

1090
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:52,150
so no let's talk about that for a minute

1091
00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:54,219
because you guys have been around you

1092
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,650
going to a million shows you know you

1093
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:58,869
see how the market is developing you

1094
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:01,360
know things are fractured you you've

1095
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:03,130
probably had retail experiences where

1096
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:06,250
you've gone in and you've seen how

1097
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:10,900
that's going how do you create your

1098
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:12,309
audience now and find that consumer like

1099
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:16,660
how do you how do what what are the

1100
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:19,150
technical how do you do that now um I'm

1101
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:20,789
not really sure to tell the truth it

1102
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,960
hasn't been a focus of mine recently

1103
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:24,610
we've been more working with other

1104
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:29,139
groups and trying to figure out how to

1105
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:30,610
you know push their agendas forward but

1106
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,739
I think ultimately you know nowadays

1107
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:35,769
it's all done through Instagram and

1108
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:38,079
social media reading the hypes creating

1109
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:39,610
the hype strains exactly but but I think

1110
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:44,099
that the real way to do it and hopefully

1111
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:46,480
the better way to do it is to create the

1112
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:47,799
god what's that horrible marketing

1113
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,510
strategy is you career

1114
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,760
the void and then you fill the void

1115
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,680
right you know create the problem you

1116
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,510
create the problems of the solution

1117
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,449
exactly and people today I think are

1118
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:59,560
doing that organically there's this

1119
00:48:57,449 --> 00:49:01,779
coronaviruses gonna kill you all and I

1120
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:04,719
saw I have this thing mass yeah right

1121
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:07,420
exactly people have been people like

1122
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:09,569
these effects associated with what they

1123
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:12,130
call a sativa you know and right now

1124
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:15,519
cultivators are all looking for our

1125
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:17,140
sativa leaning hybrids and sativas are

1126
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,079
often the first thing that sell that

1127
00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:23,920
that are sold out on the Shelf you know

1128
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:26,289
so have have they displaced indicas no

1129
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,940
not at all no no not at all but about it

1130
00:49:26,289 --> 00:49:29,440
but the market wants it is what I'm

1131
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,840
saying the market is creating this void

1132
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,579
by saying how come like every now and

1133
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,200
then get to experience these plants that

1134
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:39,159
I love but for the most part they're not

1135
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:40,449
as readily available as these hybrids so

1136
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:42,369
I do think that that's happening

1137
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:43,719
organically it just get you it's just a

1138
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:46,150
matter of getting to the point where

1139
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:48,359
everyone connects and they understand

1140
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,800
what they're looking for because

1141
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:53,200
cannabis can be so many different things

1142
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,690
for so many different people and you

1143
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:58,119
know CBD has shown that some people

1144
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:59,619
don't even want to get high but they

1145
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:02,019
want cannabis and they want it to taste

1146
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:06,069
good still so there's smokeable CBD you

1147
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:08,710
know and we you have to if you don't if

1148
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:12,250
you don't create a strategy that aligns

1149
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:14,409
specific compounds with the consumer

1150
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:16,239
then you not only do you miss the

1151
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:18,159
opportunity for them to enjoy that

1152
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:20,500
experience but you lose them as a

1153
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,500
consumer as well so it's really

1154
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:27,309
challenging I think for dispensaries to

1155
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:31,150
train staff and to have the type of

1156
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:33,789
products that their customers want when

1157
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:36,700
they walk in and they say I want to

1158
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:39,489
indica leaning hybrid with the high mere

1159
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:43,989
seen low pining but you know they're not

1160
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:46,239
quite there still we talk to dispensary

1161
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:50,169
owners California included but

1162
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:52,929
especially in other states peep ninety

1163
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:54,670
percent of customers eighty percent of

1164
00:50:52,929 --> 00:50:57,789
customers vast majority it's put it that

1165
00:50:54,670 --> 00:51:00,159
way they buy by the numbers I want a

1166
00:50:57,789 --> 00:51:01,690
twenty five I don't want a twenty one or

1167
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:03,940
twenty five now they don't realize

1168
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,670
selling the 20% THC might make them way

1169
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:10,559
way higher than someone's 25 or 30

1170
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:13,840
percent THC not always you know but I

1171
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,909
mean drunks pick wine by the alcohol

1172
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,860
content okay

1173
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:19,299
connoisseurs don't I mean people would

1174
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:23,140
just drink table wine with their food

1175
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:25,990
don't buy it by the alcohol content so

1176
00:51:23,139 --> 00:51:28,059
III pulled these out because this is a

1177
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:30,579
friend who grows up in humbled and for

1178
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:33,340
the market he grows things like Mac and

1179
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:36,519
ice-cream cake he doesn't smoke this he

1180
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:38,800
you know he's like I'm just one example

1181
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:40,929
but like lambsbread is something that he

1182
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,490
really loves and you know but it's not

1183
00:51:40,929 --> 00:51:44,379
what the market wants and he's like but

1184
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:46,089
every time I smoke my friends out his

1185
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,160
inner circle they're like I love that

1186
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:50,230
but he doesn't have the confidence to

1187
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,599
grow it at scale to see if the market

1188
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:54,070
will accept it and so he's still growing

1189
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:56,500
kind of the high-end and it probably

1190
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:58,539
yields half or two-thirds what these do

1191
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,429
and takes three or four weeks longer and

1192
00:51:58,539 --> 00:52:02,019
I think the market I don't think it's as

1193
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:05,500
much as figuring out whether the market

1194
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:07,780
wants it is convincing the cultivator to

1195
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,309
grow it first is the the Vegas lead

1196
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,660
right so you got it he's got to make

1197
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:12,340
that decision am I gonna grow this thing

1198
00:52:10,659 --> 00:52:15,190
cuz even though it yields low and

1199
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:19,510
getting it on the Shelf I mean we're in

1200
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:23,500
this Renaissance of cannabis aromas and

1201
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:26,740
like we can loud terpene profiles where

1202
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:28,960
the it's like leaping out of the jar

1203
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:30,909
into your nose and selling itself before

1204
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,599
you even consume it and some of those

1205
00:52:30,909 --> 00:52:36,969
terpene profiles may be indicative of

1206
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:38,679
the great effect associated with that

1207
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:41,799
variety but some of them might just be

1208
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:44,649
loud smelly things and we're really

1209
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:47,560
trained now to follow our nose and like

1210
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:50,710
oh this big Baba blah thing and some of

1211
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:53,289
those varieties like lambs bread they're

1212
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:55,840
not they're not dessert item Turk

1213
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:58,210
flavors the earth they're earthy and

1214
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,250
they're spicy in their herbal you know

1215
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:03,639
and they're woodsy you know the original

1216
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:05,320
Thai stick is exactly that example it

1217
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:09,089
was nothing to look at

1218
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:12,670
nothing really no real great odor to it

1219
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:14,920
but it killed I mean it was exceptional

1220
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:15,130
I mean the real one going way back which

1221
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,338
I

1222
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:21,519
for decades and it was exactly that if

1223
00:53:18,338 --> 00:53:23,619
you went by today's aesthetics you'd

1224
00:53:21,518 --> 00:53:26,318
never pick it up the only would touch it

1225
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:28,900
right it's just maybe why pre-rolls will

1226
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,759
be there saving grace for everybody you

1227
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:36,009
know just shut up and put it in your

1228
00:53:30,759 --> 00:53:39,789
mouth take a hit don't look at it

1229
00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:43,420
I'm looking fixie yeah what's it so we

1230
00:53:39,789 --> 00:53:46,569
just talked terpenes they're kind of for

1231
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,639
terpenes that dominate moderate at least

1232
00:53:46,568 --> 00:53:50,469
in California I mean it's what Mira seen

1233
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:54,440
pining

1234
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:56,119
Terrapin alene and well it's it's mercy

1235
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,190
and limonene and carry off leaner almost

1236
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:00,949
all cannabis out there it's the most

1237
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:04,190
those three Terps kind of compete for

1238
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:06,259
dominance and all the og based stuff and

1239
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:08,210
the sours and the Kim's and the wedding

1240
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,070
cakes and the gelatos and the cookies

1241
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:11,929
and stuff pretty sure those are the

1242
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:14,660
three dominance so so getting back to

1243
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:17,449
breeding what-what are you interested in

1244
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:20,389
seeing people breed

1245
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:22,730
what other terpenes are you interested

1246
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:24,379
in exploring or seeing other people

1247
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:26,780
explore well I've always been super

1248
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,769
interested in terbutaline always that's

1249
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:31,010
definitely been what I've been chasing

1250
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:34,039
is Hydra peeling variety and why because

1251
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:37,480
they seem to have the effect that I like

1252
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:40,099
there are these more energetic clear

1253
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,289
focused type varieties but what I'm

1254
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:45,019
really interested in is cannabis

1255
00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:50,329
varieties that have their own signature

1256
00:54:45,019 --> 00:54:53,360
terpene profile instead of this tropical

1257
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:54,980
punch which is amazing like you get a

1258
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,480
tropical punch you drink it and you're

1259
00:54:54,980 --> 00:55:00,079
like oh my god it's guava it's pineapple

1260
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,329
its banana it's everything but you lose

1261
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,489
the ability to pull them out and say

1262
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:07,519
like well I just want to taste a guava

1263
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:09,469
drink right now and and and having these

1264
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,239
Turk profiles that are a little bit they

1265
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:14,179
can still be really chirpy and dominant

1266
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:17,029
I mean high Terp levels but having it

1267
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:18,949
not be so many competing peaks that are

1268
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:20,510
so like there's a variety that a friends

1269
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:24,939
given us recently and we had it tested

1270
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:28,400
and it had the the least amount of

1271
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:29,809
detectable terpenes out of the twenty or

1272
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:34,880
so that they were looking for it only

1273
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:37,929
hit on twelve and most of the other more

1274
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,160
hybrid II varieties had 16 17 18 19

1275
00:55:37,929 --> 00:55:42,259
detectable terpenes because they're all

1276
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:45,019
hybrids of things that have all these

1277
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:47,210
different herb profiles so these this

1278
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:48,800
other variety was just a real high spike

1279
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,240
here and a real high spike here and

1280
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,860
nothing nothing nothing nothing and then

1281
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:54,919
a high spike here and a high spike there

1282
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:58,070
and that really show helps it to show

1283
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:00,320
what its attributes are individual

1284
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:03,380
character had they had it for a long

1285
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,769
time or had they created it they had it

1286
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,570
for a

1287
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:07,610
long time man they created it but they

1288
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:10,070
didn't dilute it by crossing it with

1289
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:12,860
everything and once you dilute things

1290
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:15,080
it's you know it's hard to it's hard to

1291
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,940
pull the Chihuahua out of a wolf you

1292
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:19,250
know what I mean but we went from a wolf

1293
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,260
to a chihuahua with with all the

1294
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,460
selective breeding and we've got all

1295
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:25,430
this diversity of all these different

1296
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:26,869
dogs but if you lost the wolf then it's

1297
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:29,089
gonna be really hard to get to the

1298
00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:30,980
Chihuahua and right now we've got away

1299
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:32,120
I've left her lapdogs oh my god I left

1300
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,460
his lapdog mutts

1301
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:36,380
yeah and we have so much hybridization

1302
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,150
in our in our industry now because we've

1303
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:41,660
had these elite cult these elite clones

1304
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:44,150
that really just took off that we're

1305
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:46,159
inbred and everything shares that's why

1306
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,539
everything has a similar effect to it

1307
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:48,920
where it leans a little bit this way or

1308
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:52,639
leans a little bit that way as opposed

1309
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,950
to distinctly different tastes and

1310
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:56,599
distinctly different effects and

1311
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:58,099
morphology I mean you used to be able to

1312
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:00,500
look at different plant varieties and

1313
00:56:58,099 --> 00:57:02,329
they all looked very different some of

1314
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,889
them were super tall and thin and

1315
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:06,769
branchy and some of them were super

1316
00:57:03,889 --> 00:57:09,259
squat and tight and now you look at most

1317
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:11,659
modern hybrid II plants kind of look the

1318
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:14,230
same what what's the one of the craziest

1319
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:17,779
plants you've ever looked at in person

1320
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:21,679
what is described it you have seen some

1321
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:24,050
really wild ones for sure um back in the

1322
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:26,779
day I used to like some of the ones from

1323
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:28,580
Colombia that we call creepers they're

1324
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:30,920
really and I just grow from seed so you

1325
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:32,569
basically just said one tall plant I

1326
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,010
didn't like top and things too much and

1327
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:35,420
a lot of my friends didn't either unless

1328
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:36,800
you're trying to hide them because you

1329
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,599
wanted to see the natural structure

1330
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,090
element and plants that look like

1331
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:43,880
Christmas trees are just pretty somehow

1332
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:46,940
very graceful these plants that grow up

1333
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:49,670
810 feet and they all the branches would

1334
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:53,269
hang down branches or up three feet we'd

1335
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:55,099
hang all the way to the ground and if

1336
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,940
you tried to grow this indoors and it'd

1337
00:57:55,099 --> 00:57:57,949
be a nightmare

1338
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,780
but when I could just stand outside on

1339
00:57:57,949 --> 00:58:03,469
its own it was really cool and it

1340
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:05,480
happened to be super nice sweet to also

1341
00:58:03,469 --> 00:58:08,719
hide terpene Alain type varieties gone

1342
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:11,630
now but fantastic stuff and I'm really

1343
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:14,059
interested in one of the things that's

1344
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:17,840
ruined our industry is is the concept of

1345
00:58:14,059 --> 00:58:21,650
bag look bag appeal yeah bag appeal

1346
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:25,850
be a little nugget a nug that goes in a

1347
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:28,130
bag another painting with white yeah

1348
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:31,219
yeah I'm fine with all the resin Glantz

1349
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:33,079
but I wish they weren't squeezed on top

1350
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:34,369
you know in Brax that are stacked on top

1351
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:36,380
of each other so tight they're miserable

1352
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:39,980
to make a she shadow that's the problem

1353
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:41,869
with them I don't okay granted hashish

1354
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:43,400
varieties Afghanistan they were hashish

1355
00:58:41,869 --> 00:58:45,799
varieties and the things like making

1356
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,840
eyes I think making hash is great I

1357
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:52,610
think you think consuming hash is great

1358
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:54,260
it didn't have to bring that one today

1359
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:56,180
but all that sheesh

1360
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:59,660
oh it wasn't there this morning Jim took

1361
00:58:56,179 --> 00:59:03,379
that one on till yeah cuz he bagged oh

1362
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:04,819
yeah okay okay just a syllable but yeah

1363
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,200
I was looking for it that's why I didn't

1364
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:11,120
find it and I just realized why right

1365
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:12,439
now but it's okay um yeah I say cache

1366
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,480
she's just great I like the cultures

1367
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,740
that were around it when I moved out um

1368
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,650
stirred um started hanging out with

1369
00:59:15,739 --> 00:59:20,959
Europeans we knew what cannabis was but

1370
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:23,720
it was basically a raw material for

1371
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,490
making ya know and I like the things

1372
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:27,289
from all these different countries and

1373
00:59:25,489 --> 00:59:29,599
that's why I wrote about it well people

1374
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:31,400
still well the sculpture still went on I

1375
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,079
probably would have thought it would go

1376
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,930
on the way it was forever since it kind

1377
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:36,590
of gone on forever but that's all

1378
00:59:35,929 --> 00:59:38,059
changed

1379
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:43,460
well so what do you think in the modern

1380
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:47,889
twist on the rosin Prince thing rosin so

1381
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:51,789
he moved from a dry sift to bubble hash

1382
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:54,859
to rosin pressing and that's kind of

1383
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:57,469
what all the kids are doing yeah I think

1384
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:59,180
it's great I mean the step she left out

1385
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:04,189
there were all them nasty solvents

1386
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:06,889
people were yeah in the solvent solvent

1387
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:10,460
world I get it but when I saw it happen

1388
01:00:06,889 --> 01:00:13,250
it's all unless yeah good but yeah it's

1389
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:15,889
it's that has been the trend and I think

1390
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:18,260
it's great they're all solvent loose and

1391
01:00:15,889 --> 01:00:20,359
I think this is the best yet and you can

1392
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:23,510
also take your water hash or your dry

1393
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:25,230
sip and it crawls and out of it so it

1394
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:28,290
all fits together very well

1395
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:30,059
that hashish is also really cool yeah I

1396
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:31,949
have to say I really feel like there's

1397
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,420
no there should we should be seeing more

1398
01:00:31,949 --> 01:00:36,049
hashish on the market and it's great

1399
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:39,809
there we have these high concentration

1400
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:41,720
extracts but hashish in its traditional

1401
01:00:39,809 --> 01:00:44,429
form was really cool because you could

1402
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:45,599
was really easy to transport you could

1403
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:47,219
put it in your pocket you could put it

1404
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,929
in a little container you could take it

1405
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:51,480
out with your finger you could break off

1406
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:53,849
a piece you could put it in a joint you

1407
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,829
could put it in the bowl stick it in a

1408
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:58,710
glass you don't even you know any

1409
01:00:55,829 --> 01:01:01,559
paraphernalia all the modern you know

1410
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:04,800
the the BHO and the rosin 's and the wax

1411
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:06,480
and stuff they take a lot of gear they

1412
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,980
take a lot of knowledge you have to

1413
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,590
understand how to use it

1414
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:12,690
I think it's intimidating to some people

1415
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,550
the way hash is just a really simple

1416
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:17,070
product and also there might even be

1417
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:20,550
something to be said for having a

1418
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:23,720
certain amount of plant matter left in

1419
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:26,940
the concentrate that it rounds off the

1420
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:29,750
the whole plant extract profile can have

1421
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:32,190
a profile thing and you know I grow

1422
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:35,219
pretty much the same ver I smoke pretty

1423
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:37,409
much the same thing every day for like a

1424
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:39,029
long time you're very consistent I'm

1425
01:01:37,409 --> 01:01:41,608
very consistent yeah I'm a routine guy

1426
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:43,590
exactly I have my tea in the morning

1427
01:01:41,608 --> 01:01:44,789
I don't drink Budweiser but if I did it

1428
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:48,240
would be the only thing my dad drank

1429
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:51,389
Budweiser exactly but um I smoked the

1430
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:53,219
same thing and I have just quickly do

1431
01:01:51,389 --> 01:01:55,409
you do you do you kind of have one thing

1432
01:01:53,219 --> 01:01:59,669
you like to smoke or do you like to to

1433
01:01:55,409 --> 01:02:02,368
dab are you a tapas kind of guy I'm yeah

1434
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:05,608
I like all of it especially when I'm in

1435
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:08,070
California cuz there's such a Laurie

1436
01:02:05,608 --> 01:02:13,858
yeah for sure but I always like coming

1437
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:16,200
home from travels but I was gonna say is

1438
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:21,090
um so ice because I smoked one thing I

1439
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:24,689
have every extracted version of that so

1440
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:26,910
I have sage and I have sage BHO and I

1441
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:30,119
have sage rosin and I've sage water hash

1442
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:35,029
and I have sage rice if all from the

1443
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:37,410
exact same point does sage does it yield

1444
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:41,010
your definition of

1445
01:02:37,409 --> 01:02:43,199
a good good hash producing cultivar is

1446
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:45,570
it good hash producing cultivar it's

1447
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,309
it's medium I mean it actually produces

1448
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:50,970
really good sage some of the hybrids

1449
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:53,820
produce better better at hashish it's

1450
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:55,169
about how well that gland snaps off at

1451
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,330
that abscission layer and makes it

1452
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:59,700
through that little pore and something

1453
01:02:57,329 --> 01:03:02,909
for some reason some of these phases and

1454
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:05,099
sages they I think they smear the glands

1455
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:06,899
just don't make it through as well and

1456
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:09,569
you end up with a bunch of leaf material

1457
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,769
that has all your burst glands all over

1458
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:12,690
it and they just don't quite but under

1459
01:03:10,769 --> 01:03:15,059
the right conditions it does make good

1460
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:17,519
hash but I was going to say is that at

1461
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:20,400
every different type of extraction

1462
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:23,400
creates a very different effect so from

1463
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,990
the from the BHO to the dry SEF their

1464
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,590
third on opposite ends of the spectrum

1465
01:03:24,989 --> 01:03:31,379
and the dry sift is the closest to

1466
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:33,210
flower so if I want the effect to be

1467
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,980
closer to flower but just kind of the

1468
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:36,990
volume turned up the dry SIF kind of

1469
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:39,150
does that but then by the time you've

1470
01:03:36,989 --> 01:03:40,979
got to rosin or even BHO you've kind of

1471
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:42,090
drifted away from it so there's

1472
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,809
definitely something to be said for

1473
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:49,170
these whole plan with the BHO kind of be

1474
01:03:45,809 --> 01:03:51,929
like louder like it's more like almost

1475
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:53,880
like young and loud it's louder in that

1476
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:57,389
it's tur pure but it's also a different

1477
01:03:53,880 --> 01:04:00,780
terpene profile because there's been so

1478
01:03:57,389 --> 01:04:02,219
much degradation and decomposition and

1479
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:05,250
all these things have happened to it and

1480
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:06,839
you're missing the plant matter that you

1481
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,909
know it's just it's just very different

1482
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,380
well it's a you you like having the

1483
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:12,659
plant matter and I feel like a lot of

1484
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:15,030
the the younger guys who make rosin

1485
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:18,750
they're they're so focused on getting

1486
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:20,850
every bit of plant matter out of it and

1487
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,199
they don't want any of it right well cuz

1488
01:04:20,849 --> 01:04:24,029
there's also a purity it's also how they

1489
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:25,439
market their product is that I've been

1490
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:28,260
able to refine this and make it pure

1491
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,210
it's kind it's very much similar to

1492
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:31,130
alcohol distillation it's like I'm not

1493
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:35,550
saying there's anything wrong with

1494
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:36,900
whiskey or scotch or vodka I like a a

1495
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:38,970
good drink every now and then as well

1496
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:41,309
but I tend to drink beer and wine

1497
01:04:38,969 --> 01:04:43,199
because it's closer to the plant version

1498
01:04:41,309 --> 01:04:46,769
of the thing that's making that alcohol

1499
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:50,549
and with cannabis you know I do think

1500
01:04:46,769 --> 01:04:51,000
that you know you can have a extract

1501
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:53,580
that

1502
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,309
has the profile that you want but if you

1503
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:59,279
had it in Flour and maintaining it from

1504
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:01,949
flower to final extract is really

1505
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:04,260
difficult especially monoterpene so just

1506
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:06,509
cool just why you process the more you

1507
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:08,460
lose yeah you're also getting rid of

1508
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,200
extraneous plant matter or whatever you

1509
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,480
don't want but you're also getting rid

1510
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:15,859
of some good stuff along the way so

1511
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,449
there's a point of diminishing returns

1512
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,430
that's amazing that people do it I guess

1513
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:22,589
is part of the fascination runes that

1514
01:05:20,429 --> 01:05:24,779
we've been able to refine it to that

1515
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:27,600
point I mean honey oil really had like a

1516
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,610
real small blip when it was available

1517
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,699
back in the day and it was amazing that

1518
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:35,640
you could oh my god you could take this

1519
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:37,109
not so you know flavorful variety and

1520
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:40,949
just turn it into this big you know

1521
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:43,019
aroma and I think the fascination is

1522
01:05:40,949 --> 01:05:44,819
there and and that's similar to alcohol

1523
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:45,690
it's it's really cool that you can do it

1524
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,000
I'm not saying there's anything wrong

1525
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:49,920
with it but to me I feel like it loses

1526
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,110
some of the nuances of what the

1527
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,519
varieties are growing you know and once

1528
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:56,280
you start dabbing with the other thing

1529
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:58,079
about increasing your intake you know

1530
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,390
once you go once you go loud you can't

1531
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,880
go back it's really hard there's this

1532
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:05,219
thing in the in the the beer industry

1533
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,590
called the loop Yulin threshold shift

1534
01:06:05,219 --> 01:06:10,589
when you start drinking hoppy or beers

1535
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:12,600
you can't go back because your brain

1536
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:15,390
resets every time it goes up and says I

1537
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:18,210
need more anymore I think anymore I've

1538
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:20,129
been moved migrating in the hoppy

1539
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:22,880
direction reason like in the past six

1540
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:27,119
months and I'd always kind of been like

1541
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:29,369
the chase for like the IPA that's more

1542
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,429
hoppy than the other guys IPA I was

1543
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:35,059
always like I just want like a Pilsner

1544
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:37,679
or lager or whatever and but now I'm

1545
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:39,929
it's hard I'm noticing myself buying

1546
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:42,359
more hoppy beers and the markets changed

1547
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:44,819
too they've in a year they've gone to

1548
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:46,470
having the happiest and highest alcohol

1549
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:48,090
content beers they could possibly come

1550
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:50,099
up with to the point where if you just

1551
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:52,710
were doing a market survey you would

1552
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:54,869
assume that it was impossible to have

1553
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:58,409
super hop forward beer that wasn't at

1554
01:06:54,869 --> 01:06:59,940
least six and a half percent alcohol now

1555
01:06:58,409 --> 01:07:01,139
it's changed again now you're going in

1556
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,460
the market and there's a whole bunch of

1557
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:04,609
beers that are actually some of them

1558
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:07,429
under five percent

1559
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:10,400
a little bit under the European norm and

1560
01:07:07,429 --> 01:07:12,980
and our hop forward they're not super

1561
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,599
hoppy but that was kind of being

1562
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:16,730
overdone a bit too so now you're getting

1563
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:21,230
the beers that are really a nice balance

1564
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:23,420
and you can drink a few and not do

1565
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:26,179
damage to yourself room for another beer

1566
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:29,780
aren't people also adding terpenes now

1567
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:32,000
to their beer creating new products yeah

1568
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:36,430
I'm not a big fan of like the mango

1569
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:39,559
yeah some of these are spiked and but

1570
01:07:36,429 --> 01:07:42,230
the real craft brewers are not I mean it

1571
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:45,110
once again it's if somebody who is a

1572
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:47,260
craft brewer now is selling way too much

1573
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:50,210
beer to be called a craft brewer or

1574
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:53,450
maybe that's not really the right term

1575
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:57,170
maybe independent brewer is a little

1576
01:07:53,449 --> 01:07:59,329
better but yeah the once they're no

1577
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:02,059
longer independent brewers the larger

1578
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:03,769
market forces take over and things tend

1579
01:08:02,059 --> 01:08:05,929
they make their production easier and

1580
01:08:03,769 --> 01:08:08,210
more consistent they didn't want their

1581
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:10,759
beer tasting different each time a real

1582
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:12,320
craft brewer kind of doesn't care I mean

1583
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,610
ok this was a little happier to last

1584
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,530
them so what maybe the next thing

1585
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:16,850
doesn't have any opportunity but they're

1586
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,409
not bottling it they're not you know

1587
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:20,180
selling hundreds of thousands of units

1588
01:08:18,409 --> 01:08:23,989
they're they're taking it down to the

1589
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:25,789
local rotary tap place and getting their

1590
01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:27,889
mates to drink a couple of kegs so they

1591
01:08:25,789 --> 01:08:30,170
can go home make some different you know

1592
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:33,170
and that that's real craft thing but

1593
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:36,170
like these market guys are saying ok we

1594
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:38,659
add prohibition and then we had alcohol

1595
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:40,190
everybody knew everybody knew somebody

1596
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:42,079
who's a moonshiner I think my

1597
01:08:40,189 --> 01:08:45,159
grandfather knew people Ramone shiners

1598
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:47,300
he used to take around samples is who's

1599
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:49,220
Salesman for the southern cottonseed oil

1600
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:51,260
company which became hunt Wesen Foods

1601
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:53,869
but he used to go around with his little

1602
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:55,640
oil samples and test tubes of course it

1603
01:08:53,869 --> 01:08:58,340
was whiskey that's how he got his

1604
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:01,010
customers you know and everybody knew

1605
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:05,690
somebody who could who made moonshine or

1606
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:07,369
grew heed its yeah we've gone they got

1607
01:09:05,689 --> 01:09:10,579
put out of business now they're back now

1608
01:09:07,369 --> 01:09:13,099
he can actually afford to get a small

1609
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:15,769
distilling license there was a time

1610
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:18,320
there when a small distiller that the

1611
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:19,580
economic thresholds were - I eat

1612
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,679
didn't have enough you couldn't sell

1613
01:09:19,579 --> 01:09:23,840
enough favorite license what other in

1614
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,740
this where we out like that that's right

1615
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,960
where we're at now

1616
01:09:24,739 --> 01:09:29,289
you can't sell enough and enough for

1617
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:34,640
profit to pay the overhead of operating

1618
01:09:29,289 --> 01:09:36,289
and Eagle II exactly full circle that's

1619
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,180
right without interstate commerce and

1620
01:09:36,289 --> 01:09:40,789
the distillers and the Brewers kept

1621
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:42,289
people out of this business they kept it

1622
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:44,390
for themselves as long as they could and

1623
01:09:42,289 --> 01:09:46,699
I'm it now has changed and I got lots a

1624
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:48,619
little we have three thousand craft

1625
01:09:46,699 --> 01:09:52,189
brewers in California that's what a

1626
01:09:48,619 --> 01:09:54,199
couple years ago right for now and

1627
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:57,289
Judith can you kind of talk about some

1628
01:09:54,199 --> 01:09:59,000
of the most intrat

1629
01:09:57,289 --> 01:10:02,359
when you were running the hash book kind

1630
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:06,369
of like some of the your interesting

1631
01:10:02,359 --> 01:10:09,589
thoughts and insights on kind of hash

1632
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:14,109
yeah define hash how do you define hash

1633
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:17,739
yeah I would say that hashish is a

1634
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:21,729
mechanical concentration of cannabis

1635
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:25,519
glands or the resin contained within

1636
01:10:21,729 --> 01:10:29,689
but the glands are made intact for the

1637
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:31,640
most part and they're it's not the

1638
01:10:29,689 --> 01:10:35,029
active ingredients are not dissolved in

1639
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:36,980
any way water hashes not because water

1640
01:10:35,029 --> 01:10:39,559
is the universal solvent and in fact it

1641
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:41,839
works because him resin glands are not

1642
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:43,460
soluble in water it's it's just like

1643
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,699
moving around with air you're moving

1644
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:49,279
around the water but yeah that's the

1645
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:50,630
definition for me I think the

1646
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,789
fascinating they are made off no

1647
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:54,319
botanist by training so the fascinating

1648
01:10:52,789 --> 01:10:56,930
thing to me is the plants and the

1649
01:10:54,319 --> 01:11:00,609
cultures and hashish was a great example

1650
01:10:56,930 --> 01:11:05,150
everybody has varying strategies for

1651
01:11:00,609 --> 01:11:08,509
achieving essentially the same end and I

1652
01:11:05,149 --> 01:11:12,159
find this also with fiber production

1653
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:15,680
with hemp I'm very in-depth textiles and

1654
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:16,880
hemp for a seed and fiber as well and I

1655
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,380
like the different strategies that

1656
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:21,440
people around the world to come up with

1657
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:23,750
for working with hemp fibers and to take

1658
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:27,469
him all the way to making fine texels

1659
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:30,350
wrong so yeah it's interesting it's for

1660
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:32,340
me it's much more about the people than

1661
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:38,170
the plan

1662
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:42,100
if yeah so for those cultivators who

1663
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:46,600
cultivate for hash you know they which

1664
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:49,570
we and we know several who do is in that

1665
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:52,829
is that also about the person rather

1666
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:55,479
like been the plant it's the poor it's

1667
01:11:52,829 --> 01:11:57,250
if we know some of the same people which

1668
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:59,500
I assume we dear that I'd have to answer

1669
01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:02,560
that question in the affirmative but

1670
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:06,060
because those people are characters but

1671
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:10,720
they don't represent cultures if you

1672
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:12,550
know outside of North America yeah well

1673
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,320
one of them said to me once you know you

1674
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:16,449
should write write an article on the

1675
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:19,779
cultivator in the hash maker and I said

1676
01:12:16,449 --> 01:12:22,000
and I realized that I knew three or four

1677
01:12:19,779 --> 01:12:24,029
different relationships that were that

1678
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,920
relationship a cultivator who had a

1679
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:28,989
relationship with a hash maker and out

1680
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:33,310
of that relationship they created a

1681
01:12:28,989 --> 01:12:35,260
third product and haven't done the

1682
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:37,150
article but I thought it was really

1683
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:39,280
interesting and a great idea just

1684
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:41,889
curious what you think about those

1685
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:44,739
relationships is it was it real are they

1686
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:46,960
real because they're they're actually

1687
01:12:44,739 --> 01:12:49,179
really out there it was real enough to

1688
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:55,149
make that batch of hash apparently it

1689
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:57,579
was good so yeah I mean it's it's kind

1690
01:12:55,149 --> 01:12:59,109
of the same way with the land races land

1691
01:12:57,579 --> 01:13:01,930
races are there because there was a

1692
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:03,429
culture that raised the plant in their

1693
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:06,010
own local environment

1694
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:08,619
year after year from seed so there was a

1695
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:12,159
chance for genetic variation each year

1696
01:13:08,619 --> 01:13:18,250
and without the cultures you lose the

1697
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:21,369
land race it's it's not just that we've

1698
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:23,859
gone back and taken Dutch scoop seeds to

1699
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:25,630
Nepal but it's part of the problem but

1700
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:28,149
the problem also is that the Nepali

1701
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:30,670
people who were making that Ashish back

1702
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:33,879
in the day that they got older they

1703
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:35,619
don't live there anymore or they move

1704
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:38,109
because they've degraded the land around

1705
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:40,029
them or it's just everything changes

1706
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:41,769
it's and and you can get really

1707
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:43,689
sentimental and the older I get I guess

1708
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:46,480
the more realistic I get a hope

1709
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:48,969
but also a bit sentimental and and you

1710
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:50,349
miss these things and you there are

1711
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:52,840
times when you wish time would stand

1712
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:55,090
still and things would remain the way

1713
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:57,730
they have been but the essence of

1714
01:13:55,090 --> 01:14:01,329
culture is change and all we ever get is

1715
01:13:57,729 --> 01:14:02,979
a snapshot we if it didn't change it

1716
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:06,550
wouldn't be culture and it really

1717
01:14:02,979 --> 01:14:08,729
wouldn't be interesting so yeah that's

1718
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:11,829
that's it - and and the Hat

1719
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:17,109
transformation from a hemp plant to a

1720
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:21,399
textile or cannabis plant landrace are

1721
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:22,839
not - a piece of hashish or rosin or BHO

1722
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:25,539
for that matter I think this is all

1723
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:27,520
interesting to employ have they taken it

1724
01:14:25,539 --> 01:14:31,510
to these two limits I mean just recently

1725
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:33,370
I saw these THC a to me ISM I mean I saw

1726
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:35,170
it ground up there's a white powder of

1727
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:37,239
course in a lab substance over the years

1728
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:40,359
and looks like all it looks like every

1729
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:42,550
other cannabinoid pretty much except THC

1730
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:45,189
which is just not a white powdery thing

1731
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:48,850
at all it's almost if you've never

1732
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:53,139
messed with it it has got to be the most

1733
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:54,940
viscous sticky liquid on the planet just

1734
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:56,619
about I mean you can tip this if it was

1735
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:58,599
filled with THC right now you just tip

1736
01:14:56,619 --> 01:15:01,210
it over inside even a warm room

1737
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:03,490
temperature like this and half hour

1738
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:05,319
later might be just kind of starting to

1739
01:15:03,489 --> 01:15:11,619
think about leaking out on the table

1740
01:15:05,319 --> 01:15:13,420
it's incredible THC a is a dry freely

1741
01:15:11,619 --> 01:15:15,699
flowing powder if you grind it up and

1742
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:18,520
otherwise it's these beautiful crystals

1743
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:20,319
which these young guys now are getting

1744
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:22,570
to precipitate out all these different

1745
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:25,059
shapes so you can cut these flat kind of

1746
01:15:22,569 --> 01:15:26,949
triangular big crystals and you've got

1747
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:28,090
ones that look just like rock salt and

1748
01:15:26,949 --> 01:15:33,670
you've got other ones who look just like

1749
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:35,260
rock candy yeah and wands great it's

1750
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:37,510
fascinating what do you got to do that

1751
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:40,150
put the terpenes back in it you know I

1752
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:41,949
think people are like that literally

1753
01:15:40,149 --> 01:15:44,079
just to show that they can do it it's

1754
01:15:41,949 --> 01:15:45,939
awesome and there's no IP on it if you

1755
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:48,159
want to know how to do it just log on to

1756
01:15:45,939 --> 01:15:50,199
YouTube and they'll be any number of

1757
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:52,000
kids they'll show you their variations

1758
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:53,979
for doing this stuff and it's it's great

1759
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,279
in this world where we're all struggling

1760
01:15:53,979 --> 01:15:58,259
for IP which is part of what we're just

1761
01:15:56,279 --> 01:16:00,090
talking about I also find it really

1762
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:03,150
refreshing that all this stuff is just

1763
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:06,059
out there and anybody wants to do it can

1764
01:16:03,149 --> 01:16:09,089
do it you know and yeah

1765
01:16:06,059 --> 01:16:10,590
nobody even tried to claim the rosin

1766
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:14,550
thing because everybody already watched

1767
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:18,090
it happen on you to watch the first guy

1768
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:20,520
do it and he went dudes check this out

1769
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:24,059
everybody can do this it's amazing my

1770
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:25,920
wife's hair straightener yeah all right

1771
01:16:24,059 --> 01:16:27,980
so then the next episode of t-shirt for

1772
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,980
us
