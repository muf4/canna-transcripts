1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,960
I just saw a Moses talk confident

2
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,660
cannabis you did a fantastic job

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,179
presenting sort of a larger data science

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,820
project that coughing cannabis is

5
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:30,000
undertaking in that space it's hard work

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,689
in general to take sort of good data and

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,369
provide kind of key insights to it

8
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:37,019
what's what's sort of your biggest

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:40,589
takeaway after working with the data for

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,340
so long and what direction do you think

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,170
that data is taking shape and the kinds

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,239
of good questions that you think we

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,379
should ask kind of in the future about

14
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,959
it what are what are the ones that keep

15
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,729
you up at night I think the biggest

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,329
thing that's emerged from looking at the

17
00:00:53,729 --> 00:01:00,119
data is how much variation there is in

18
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,100
the chemistry of cannabis not just from

19
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,899
strain name to strain name but within a

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,790
strain name from producer to producer

21
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,579
from harvest to harvest and even within

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,210
a harvest and it really it turns out

23
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:14,158
that people when you shop for cannabis

24
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,019
what you're really shopping for is a

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,820
bundle of chemicals is a bundle of

26
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:19,349
chemistry that you think is going to

27
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,329
have produced an experience that you

28
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:22,709
think is going to produce an effect and

29
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:24,688
it turns out that the way that we

30
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,250
present cannabis to the market I try and

31
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:27,798
take a market approach to these things

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,109
I'm not a chemist I'm not a biologist

33
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,549
I'm more of an economist and so I think

34
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:33,659
trying to get market approach and it

35
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,460
turns out to the way that we sell

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,618
cannabis to the market in terms of

37
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,419
indica sativa hybrid in terms of what's

38
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,519
a what's the strain aim with the genetic

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,950
origin of the strain that's probably not

40
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,408
the best way to help customers get the

41
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,519
experience that they're looking to get

42
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,380
interesting one of the things that's

43
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,938
interesting we're here in Nevada and one

44
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,819
of the great things that Nevada has done

45
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:56,279
really leading the other states is by

46
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,199
requiring terpene testing for all of

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,180
their cannabis products and so if you're

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,710
looking for a particular terpene you can

49
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,110
go into the dispensaries here and we've

50
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:05,459
been our team came in from Palo Alto and

51
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,420
we've been going to the dispensaries

52
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,368
here and just talking to each other

53
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,628
about how fantastic it is that we can

54
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:12,150
tell what terpenes are in what we're

55
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,469
purchasing I really I just wish every

56
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,680
state would do that I know

57
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:19,289
there's a lot of legacy cannabis users

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,610
who want that terpene information and

59
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:23,579
for years they've been saying things

60
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,590
along the lines of well it's not just a

61
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,450
numbers game I I don't necessarily want

62
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,759
the highest potency I want some

63
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:33,359
additional flavor in there and I'm

64
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:36,569
looking for it the Kiev are kind of the

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,130
strain name that we've seen kind of

66
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,829
emerge is really the fundamental

67
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:44,419
branding of cannabis so when you kind of

68
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:47,880
go after and identify specific strains

69
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:49,500
what you're really doing is you're kind

70
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,530
of delving into the brand history there

71
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,569
and it's a legacy it's a legacy subject

72
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,340
and and I think people identify with

73
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,289
those early brands in cannabis even

74
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,670
before the names of companies been

75
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:01,349
generated that's interesting one of the

76
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:05,219
things that I talked about mentioned in

77
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:07,650
the talk I met a few weeks ago a fellow

78
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,310
who ran grows in Humboldt County in the

79
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,110
1970s and 80s just bumped into him by

80
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,819
randomly in the Philippines actually but

81
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,870
I asked him I said what's it what's the

82
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,909
difference between an indica and sativa

83
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,709
you're a viewer a grower and you were a

84
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,209
grower when cannabis was first starting

85
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,090
in America what's the difference between

86
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,009
indica sativa me is it Mersin is it

87
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:30,180
Turpin alene he said it's how high the

88
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:32,250
plant grows alright that kind of answers

89
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,659
the question doesn't it that's a great

90
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,840
fundamental approach and if we can find

91
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:39,090
kind of simple answers to help consumers

92
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,670
on that end I would love to see things

93
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,289
like that come out of your data set and

94
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:45,389
sort of the data set emerging through

95
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:47,699
all of the users at confident cannabis

96
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,149
all the labs who participate in that

97
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,949
sort of experience should have some sort

98
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,200
of accessible platform where they can go

99
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:57,449
and ask basic questions about their

100
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,159
consumers where these products are

101
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:01,589
coming from and only that but have

102
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,109
stored the horsepower of good

103
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,909
statistical analysis to back it up it's

104
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,890
one of the wonderful things working for

105
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,560
me working at confident cannabis is that

106
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,629
they're true believers in data science

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,750
and in the importance of science itself

108
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:17,279
there's never been pressure to cause the

109
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,230
to cause the tools to produce one result

110
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,059
or another we really let the data form

111
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,939
its own shape and we let the data tell

112
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,228
us what it wants to tell us and one of

113
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,370
the what I was presenting today was this

114
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:26,909
tool that we've constructed called

115
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,310
connect

116
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,750
which is a way of visualizing cannabis

117
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,329
strains in terms of their chemical

118
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,850
content and we built that for a lot of

119
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:37,529
different people we built it so that

120
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,760
consumers can figure out what it is

121
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:40,829
they've been smoking what the chemistry

122
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,939
was so that they can find if they have

123
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:43,979
an experience that they like they can

124
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:46,259
find things nearby so they can find new

125
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,870
strains we built it so that dispensaries

126
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,029
can have a diverse range of products on

127
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,620
their shelf and figure out what a divert

128
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:54,449
and what it means to have a diverse work

129
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,100
it chemically diverse range of products

130
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,599
on their shelf and we built it for

131
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,730
producers to figure out where their

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,189
strains fit in to help them diversify

133
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:05,580
against price movements and so forth so

134
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:07,529
we're trying to figure out ways that we

135
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:10,199
can use the data to help our customers

136
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:11,909
to advance their goals you know we're

137
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,829
trying not to get ahead of our labs or

138
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,330
data providers we don't know if they

139
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:17,039
want to be producing publishing on a

140
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:19,349
subject we're not going to research that

141
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,030
subject we try and find ways to use this

142
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,850
this enormous wonderful data set that

143
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:26,609
we've accumulated to use it in ways that

144
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,860
help the whole industry now from my

145
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,009
general perspective I'm a I'm a chemist

146
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,259
but I'm also a chemical engineer and I

147
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,310
have just general questions to ask of

148
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:40,129
the data set and I thought you actually

149
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:42,629
presented sort of the good test data

150
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:46,560
sets and sort of the general approaches

151
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:48,149
and questions that you've asked to sort

152
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,829
of answering broader questions again

153
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:52,139
what what kind of selectivity

154
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:56,039
differences do we have across the space

155
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:59,430
to uniquely identify the plants that we

156
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,620
all care about and love and from from my

157
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,400
perspective I think you're providing a

158
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,459
tool that helps all businesses in

159
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:11,310
between I represent a large investment

160
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:14,459
firm across the space c21 investments

161
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,829
who's acquired everything from grows to

162
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:19,109
dispensaries and all the things in

163
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:20,759
between and from a processor perspective

164
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,710
we're always looking at sort of the

165
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,860
frontier of cannabis and we want to know

166
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:28,379
how so the market is not only evolving

167
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,699
but the product evolution and we want to

168
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:31,918
back that with good science and data

169
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,689
when we put a product out we want it to

170
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,829
be something that not only consumers

171
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:38,019
have asked for but

172
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:39,969
give them something maybe new to the

173
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:42,038
experience and we want to use data to

174
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:46,030
sort of guide those experiences and so

175
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:47,439
if terpenes are really not uniquely

176
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:49,658
identifying a plant but it's

177
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,969
inexperienced customers or asking for

178
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:54,788
I think that's perfect information

179
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,770
that's the kind of information that we

180
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:59,529
love to hear and good simplifications

181
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:02,978
like that from these larger data sets

182
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:07,568
very small conclusions can lead to very

183
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:09,098
very strong strategic decisions one of

184
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:12,848
the cushions are trying to dancer early

185
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:16,870
on was can we build a model for

186
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:18,759
predicting the strain of a based on the

187
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,740
lay up test data sample based on the

188
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,680
sample data right and the answer was no

189
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,139
and the reason is that there are so many

190
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,930
different products sold under the same

191
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,250
strain names that the data doesn't

192
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,810
differentiate between them there are

193
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,949
some strains that does that where you

194
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:38,889
can differentiate there are some

195
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:40,419
outliers but for the strains that are in

196
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,129
common use the Blue Dreams the Jack

197
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:44,049
Herer is the sour diesels the Girl Scout

198
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,550
cookies of the world there are so many

199
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,310
different products sold under that name

200
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:53,560
that there is not a way a statistically

201
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,848
valid way of distinguishing whether a of

202
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,589
assigning a plant to one of those

203
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:59,379
categories or another based on their lab

204
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:01,750
test data so seeing seeing as how you're

205
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:04,300
building sort of this larger platform

206
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:09,098
for integrating all manner of data sets

207
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,840
to ask questions about from from a

208
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:12,728
larger perspective what kinds of data

209
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,008
sets would you like to see integrated in

210
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:17,589
the future and what what could

211
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:20,639
businesses do to help enable that it

212
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:23,978
would it be as simple as adding surveys

213
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:29,528
to the space or collecting more public

214
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:33,250
health type information to policy public

215
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:35,528
policy type integration to get an

216
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,958
understanding of how product is flowing

217
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:40,929
sort of across the larger space so what

218
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,478
we like to see that that I would love to

219
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,789
be integrated in three places and we're

220
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,900
already in talks for two of those places

221
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:49,480
there's one one that we're

222
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:52,299
the first is to try and develop and

223
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,490
support accumulate data to try and

224
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:56,019
develop the relationship between these

225
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,940
chemicals and different experiences and

226
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:59,889
so we're looking to integrate with

227
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,960
companies that have and are collecting

228
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:04,659
data sets of cannabis experience

229
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,790
reactions and finding ways to tie those

230
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:08,589
experience reactions back to the

231
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:11,199
chemistry in a statistically valid way

232
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,450
the danger here is that when you get

233
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,210
into experience you're really talking

234
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:18,730
about health information and we want to

235
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:21,280
be very careful about not telling giving

236
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,080
people health advice unless we know that

237
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,549
what we're saying is really strongly

238
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:29,379
founded in verifiable science and so

239
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:31,269
we've been looking for datasets that are

240
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:34,750
sufficiently robust sufficiently

241
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:38,199
detailed and sufficiently valid unbiased

242
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,419
to support that the second spilly place

243
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,450
where we've been looking to accumulate

244
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:45,819
data relates to pricing we take a market

245
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,030
approach to cannabis where we're not

246
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,250
trying to figure out what the

247
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,929
biosynthesis of cannabis is we're not

248
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,730
trying to be biologists we're not trying

249
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:56,679
to be chemists what we're trying to do

250
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,450
is look at how cannabis behaves on the

251
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,370
market what are the different categories

252
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:06,009
we categorize it based on how the market

253
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:07,389
categorizes it and so what we really

254
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:09,639
would like to be accumulating is data

255
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:11,949
about the pricing of cannabis figuring

256
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,019
out how different cannabis based on its

257
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,670
chemical content and based on the visual

258
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,799
quality of it is selling at different

259
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:19,389
prices that's the second data set that

260
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:21,129
we're looking to accumulate we talked a

261
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:24,129
little bit about that today in the

262
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:26,710
presentation to explain how our analysis

263
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:28,559
of chemical differences relates to the

264
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,759
build-out of a pricing prediction model

265
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,779
the third place where we really would

266
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,360
like to be integrating is with

267
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:35,649
point-of-sale folks and we built out the

268
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,440
skin and the reason I'd like to be

269
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,669
integrating there is I'd love to have a

270
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,980
forward-looking view on where the demand

271
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:44,679
is going I'd really would like to be

272
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,409
able to get demographics for how the

273
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:48,909
demand for different cannabis products

274
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:51,370
is reaching out into different

275
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:54,279
demographics and we built this product

276
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:58,149
Kinect Kinect confident cannabis calm

277
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,039
it's free and Kinect lets you explore

278
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:00,429
different cannabis strains in terms of

279
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,899
their chem

280
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:03,370
data we really think that there's a

281
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:05,289
potential synergy there with people who

282
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,879
are doing point-of-sale applications

283
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,500
where we could have connect out in the

284
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,929
dispensary we could link it up to

285
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,940
various point-of-sale systems and we can

286
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:16,569
help dispensaries figure out what they

287
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,650
want to order for the next month to you

288
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,260
know where the demand is going to be a

289
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:22,329
month from now to help them pre populate

290
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:24,700
and pre do pre-orders for their next

291
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,320
cannabis buys and what would that would

292
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,700
get for us is forward-looking

293
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,500
perspective on where the market is

294
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,509
moving and where demand is moving that's

295
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,370
incredibly interesting as far as getting

296
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:35,919
larger predictions across that market

297
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,799
and the types of discussions those

298
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:42,129
things enable when you have sort of a

299
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:44,649
direction again you can from from my

300
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:46,710
perspective you can align sort of your

301
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:50,740
vision to it and you can get a very

302
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:53,620
concise vision of where we're heading in

303
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:57,070
cannabis and it's great to see everybody

304
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,980
here at the show and see sort of the

305
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,160
up-and-coming technology but trying to

306
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,789
eliminate a lot of that confusion and

307
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:09,159
getting hard specific data that that

308
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:12,219
allows for the fundamental backing of

309
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:15,610
what you're doing really really is

310
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,560
fantastic you've also given us a tool to

311
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,629
the to the broader community something

312
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:23,879
that we can ask questions of and

313
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:26,169
interact with and get a sense of how to

314
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,879
essentially make everyone's job a little

315
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:30,279
bit easier and a little bit more

316
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:34,179
informed and I think that's a really

317
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,730
wonderful approach information in a very

318
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:39,069
concise way is a very powerful tool and

319
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,620
it's always been that way in the

320
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,900
cannabis community but again going back

321
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,379
to old claims is an important part of

322
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:49,389
the scientific process and so it's it's

323
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:51,990
a wonderful approach I think the the

324
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:56,049
economic approach to sort of the broader

325
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:58,779
data analysis and for example are you

326
00:12:56,049 --> 00:13:03,099
looking at all are you forming any other

327
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:04,579
types of partnerships sort of sort of

328
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,879
outside of

329
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,550
the spheres that you mentioned and

330
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,409
looking at more of like policymaking for

331
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:15,649
example are you are you looking at

332
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:18,350
public health sorts of information or if

333
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:20,659
you had people interested on those

334
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,060
fronts other like the medical community

335
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:25,429
for example because Dan abysus

336
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:28,729
is fundamentally sort of a medical

337
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:32,809
product that's it's kind of the initial

338
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,039
push to the legal space and we have

339
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,929
there's a lot of questions coming from

340
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:37,278
there we have looked at working with

341
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:40,159
people who are conducting clinical

342
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,649
trials or at least double-blind studies

343
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,319
of cannabis health effects there's

344
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:48,169
nothing I can announce about that today

345
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,089
the other group that we've looked to be

346
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,799
integrating with our folks who are

347
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,829
collecting data about the effect of

348
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:58,189
different production method choices and

349
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:59,838
different growth choices on chemistry

350
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:03,950
when I mean pressure myth is what I mean

351
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,480
is when you are growing cannabis there

352
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,700
are thousands of choices that you make

353
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,170
in the growing process when we think

354
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,470
about cannabis we think about the strain

355
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:14,269
which is supposedly the seed but and we

356
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:17,690
and we don't think about all the effort

357
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:20,659
and work and creativity that gets put in

358
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,490
by the farmer but those things matter

359
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:26,240
how long they leave the plant up

360
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,310
temperature lighting fertilizer water

361
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,139
there are thousands and thousands of

362
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:31,789
thousands of choices that they make

363
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,899
throughout the production process that

364
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:36,980
have an enormous impact on chemistry I

365
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:39,259
don't there are people who believe that

366
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,639
we are our genes I don't believe that I

367
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:43,250
don't think people are their genes

368
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,708
I don't think plants are their genes I

369
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,208
don't think that's how life works and I

370
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:49,009
think those choices that producers make

371
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,809
have a tremendous impact and one of the

372
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,250
folks there one of the areas where we've

373
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:54,619
been looking to team up with folks are

374
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,850
folks who are collecting data across how

375
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,899
different choices in the production

376
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:01,699
process influence that chemical outcome

377
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:05,448
absolutely and and sort of that nature

378
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:08,240
versus nurture discussion I think is

379
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:10,609
just starting to sort of activate on

380
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,039
this end and as you get more data as

381
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,440
part of this project we'll kind of dive

382
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,579
into it and we'll see how fundamentally

383
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,340
the creativity is

384
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:24,629
mentioned of various growers and just

385
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:27,330
various producers across the space has

386
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:28,980
influenced the direction in the position

387
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,950
where cannabis sits today the the

388
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:37,230
products we know and love may just be

389
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:41,940
sort of a broader sense the love you put

390
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:43,440
into a product is essentially the best

391
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,000
selling point potentially of your

392
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,980
product there may be something there to

393
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,529
it that sort of emerges from the data

394
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,920
and the way you you treat these things

395
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:54,839
in your talk today we saw it kind of - I

396
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:58,679
saw two major distinctions and the data

397
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:01,200
set that you presented and can be

398
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:04,589
accessed through connect I saw sort of a

399
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,860
serpentine head sort of form and we also

400
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:11,399
saw separations in THC and CBD are there

401
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,659
any other kind of fluid separations

402
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,049
starting to happen in that data set

403
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:18,139
there a tremendous number of them there

404
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:22,079
are so there are groups that cluster out

405
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:24,809
because of CBD v because of CB n because

406
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,450
of lynn Ahlul because of various

407
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:29,879
combinations of terpenes and as our data

408
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,220
set is growing we see more clusters

409
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,019
emerging the way that our algorithm

410
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,950
works you have to have a certain number

411
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:40,110
of points that are friends of each other

412
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,120
before they can become a distinct

413
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,590
cluster a certain number of nearest

414
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,940
neighbors so as our dataset burrows and

415
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,500
we have enough data for more of those

416
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,500
clusters to emerge those clusters are

417
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,600
emerging we have in the in connect we

418
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,059
call some of these things regions where

419
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,700
we discretize the space we look for

420
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:02,489
areas of the space where some of the

421
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,519
cannabis products have separated

422
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,799
themselves from the rest and we have I

423
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,660
think 20 or 30 of these regions at the

424
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,039
moment and you can go through the region

425
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,350
map and you can see how each of these

426
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,029
things has a distinct chemistry it's

427
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:16,230
actually a very convenient way if you're

428
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:18,088
looking for to find a particular

429
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,338
chemistry it's a very convenient way of

430
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:21,509
finding that chemistry in connect as we

431
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:23,698
start to get some of these groupings

432
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:25,959
emerged how do you set sort of the new

433
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,899
bounds for new states that are emerging

434
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:32,379
and and really how how is it that you

435
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:34,599
draw a circle around or a shape around

436
00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:36,428
sort of that new grouping and identified

437
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,079
as a unique grouping because I may look

438
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:41,139
at it and say well I think this is a

439
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:43,569
unique grouping that's evident and you

440
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:46,599
see this as a unique grouping and larger

441
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:48,970
discrepancies may arise in the long term

442
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:51,819
as we start to form this blob so how do

443
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:55,690
you approach those sorts of questions we

444
00:17:51,819 --> 00:18:01,210
use math for that okay to be serious

445
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:04,450
okay so how do we find the clusters the

446
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,028
question fundamentally is about how you

447
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,669
solve the problem of clustering in data

448
00:18:07,028 --> 00:18:13,298
science and the problem of clustering in

449
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:15,369
data science is that you get data and

450
00:18:13,298 --> 00:18:17,349
there's lots of points and somebody

451
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:19,480
wants those points to be divided into

452
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:20,918
you have a million points but you need

453
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,110
to divide them into a sufficiently small

454
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:24,940
number of groups that a human being can

455
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:27,758
understand them and what you want is a

456
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:31,389
data-driven way to separate them out

457
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,339
into natural groups where the groups are

458
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:35,138
there are a few enough groups that you

459
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:37,470
can go one after another and look at

460
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:40,209
them so how do you go about doing that

461
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,278
that's one of the significant challenges

462
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,528
in data science today is different

463
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:46,388
approaches to clustering and I think in

464
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:48,339
data science when you're approaching the

465
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:53,199
clustering problem you really need to

466
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:54,668
ask the question what usage what what

467
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,649
are these clusters going to be used for

468
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:59,139
and I think that should guide your

469
00:18:56,648 --> 00:19:01,898
choice of clustering methodology the

470
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:05,769
clustering methodology that we chose the

471
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:08,288
purpose of this clustering is not to

472
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,599
take strong positions about how many

473
00:19:08,288 --> 00:19:12,069
kinds of cannabis there are or what the

474
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,748
boundaries between one kind of cannabis

475
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:15,579
on or another are they are to help

476
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:19,028
people navigate what's otherwise a very

477
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:21,628
complex topological shape we have a 3d

478
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:24,398
we have a twenty six dimensional

479
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:27,519
construct that we've reduced to three

480
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:29,199
dimensions with a very complex topology

481
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,259
and we want to help people find their

482
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,999
way around that to navigate that and so

483
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:37,659
what we wanted was something that simply

484
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:39,870
discretize is that space but we also see

485
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:41,820
in the space that we have very

486
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:43,379
we have areas of the space that are very

487
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:45,359
dense and we have areas of the space

488
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,920
that are not very dense and we wanted a

489
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,479
clustering methodology that was going to

490
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,890
respect that and that was going to

491
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,630
recognize that you can have a non dense

492
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:55,110
area that is a cluster as well as a

493
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,460
dense area that's a cluster so the

494
00:19:55,109 --> 00:20:00,709
algorithm that we're using is called

495
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:03,930
optics we looked at a bunch of different

496
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,670
density based algorithms I tend to

497
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,900
prefer density based clustering when you

498
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,029
have very high dimensional data like

499
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,769
this I prefer a density based clustering

500
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:15,720
the advantage of optics over the the two

501
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:20,309
competitive algorithms are DB scan and

502
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,920
HDB scan the problem with DB scan is

503
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:24,929
that it is non adaptive you have to have

504
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,670
a single density barrier which is the

505
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,200
boundary condition for all clusters it

506
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,000
doesn't respect that some clusters can

507
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,850
be more dense in some clusters less

508
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,599
dense optics can be is dynamic with

509
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:37,769
respect to its boundary condition it's

510
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,799
actually optics combined with another

511
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:42,690
algorithm that's dynamic I'm HDB scan is

512
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,190
usually my favorite algorithm it

513
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,710
produces a hierarchical density based

514
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,680
clustering the trouble is that HDB scan

515
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,200
tends to produce too few clusters and

516
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,120
not as many as you want

517
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,519
optics had the natural balance where we

518
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,679
produced or was able to produce the

519
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,029
right number of clusters a sufficiently

520
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,920
small number that a human being could

521
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:04,889
comprehend them so how do we set our

522
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,390
boundary condition in optics well we

523
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,520
actually do that through optimization

524
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,590
where we have a target number of

525
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,940
clusters that we want to generate and we

526
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:14,399
have a target number of clusters where

527
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,740
each cluster has a certain maximum a

528
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,840
minimum number of points and we there's

529
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,140
a one parameter to optimize an optics

530
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,699
the alpha parameter and we run a what's

531
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,890
it called

532
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,690
we run a simple optimization algorithm

533
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,700
where we try and vary the alpha

534
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,279
parameter to hit into the acceptable

535
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,200
range of cluster numbers the general

536
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,259
clusters that you provided are just

537
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,440
generally true clusters of the data it's

538
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:43,379
so yes not necessarily that's actually

539
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,820
right to say this cluster II or these

540
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,160
grouping of farmers you're not giving

541
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,689
selected preference to anybody in the

542
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,090
absolutely right is a data-driven

543
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,390
approach to seeing what this data looks

544
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:53,549
like

545
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,860
that's right natural shape is not guided

546
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:57,960
by means that's absolutely true what we

547
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:00,000
say is how many clusters do people want

548
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,829
to deal with they're willing to deal

549
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,329
with basically I think between twelve

550
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:06,210
and thirty clusters that's

551
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:08,609
comprehensible so what we do is we say

552
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,890
we let the data naturally find between

553
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:12,479
twelve and thirty clusters and however

554
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,750
many it finds that's how many clusters

555
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,750
there are

556
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,969
you

557
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,969
