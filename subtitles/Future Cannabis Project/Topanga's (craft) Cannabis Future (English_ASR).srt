2
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,820
panga Canyon is an unincorporated area

3
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:26,189
very well known within the cannabis

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,599
space itself as well to everyone kind of

5
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,160
hasn't understood that there are growers

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,570
there people grow for their own personal

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,399
use or otherwise it's been historically

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,730
done there and it's a great location for

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,989
all that what's been surprising to us in

10
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,339
a very positive way is that that

11
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:40,500
community when I looked at that loading

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,680
data the community was actually at 76

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,149
percents in favor of prop 64 passing so

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,488
by far they were one of the larger you

15
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,189
know highest rated enemies that in favor

16
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:52,558
of illegal cannabis there however the

17
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,000
way the current zoning is set up their

18
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,849
supervisor who represents them

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,558
supervisor Sheila Kuehl who is very

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,448
favorable to topic she has always been

21
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,209
favorable she she wants to see a

22
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:05,938
regulated market however she has not had

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,859
a very loud voice in this discussion

24
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,228
because the zoning has made so her

25
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,180
district essentially would only have the

26
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:14,879
ability to have only one dispensary in

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,580
the entire district for her and no

28
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,048
cultivation and cultivation would be

29
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,000
hard to find anything else on there so

30
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,710
the entire Topanga Canyon area all that

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
stuff in there there is no zoning that

32
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,938
is allowed for any commercial cannabis

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,310
use indoor outdoor you name it so this

34
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:31,529
is an example where the town councils

35
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,689
started getting in the ear of the County

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,780
Board of Supervisors saying hey we would

37
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:40,589
like either indoor outdoor cultivation

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,689
in the Topanga area that maybe the Board

39
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,640
of Supervisors would start to listen to

40
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:48,209
them and it seems like the current

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,140
policy is all cannabis cultivation in

42
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:54,419
this little tiny needle pen sized area

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,368
of the entire county that's where it's

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,290
all going to happen and what we need is

45
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:01,049
people in different areas saying hey

46
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,759
we'd like it in our area too and by the

47
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,579
way we also like to do greenhouse or

48
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,750
outdoor yeah and I mean it's really

49
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:08,519
important because they've that if that

50
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,128
town council could vote with a voice

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,319
that opinion more strongly to supervisor

52
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:13,679
Kuehl she would be even more encouraged

53
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,289
to

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,718
supports you know expanding and actually

55
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:20,009
having a viable canvas market I think

56
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:21,840
right now what they have proposed is not

57
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,789
a viable market there's also the

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,098
contrast to where you have certain town

59
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:27,509
councils that have people that sit on

60
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:28,738
them that are conservative have based

61
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:29,968
their opinion and they voice that

62
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,609
opinion but it doesn't reflect what the

63
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:35,519
actual voting data is for the area so if

64
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:36,870
a panga canyons Town Council has decided

65
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,908
that they've had this discussion

66
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,069
previously last year when we went out to

67
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,509
do a opportunity to speak with them they

68
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:44,310
spoke about it or you know about an hour

69
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:45,479
on the thing and since that time they've

70
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,459
backed away and said great there's not

71
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:48,988
gonna be anything happening here I don't

72
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,090
see that that is reflecting the will of

73
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,319
what the residents are there and the

74
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,400
residents are the ones that need to show

75
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,750
them that's just something they want

76
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,340
they need to go to their town council

77
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,019
and they need to talk to them and say we

78
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,878
voted for this thing if we don't do this

79
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,989
there are parents that can be separate

80
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:02,608
from their children there could be so

81
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,438
many other consequences on this stuff if

82
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:06,209
they are continuing to do their grows

83
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:13,530
because the laws no longer support them

84
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:16,680
to do that council I'd like to have a

85
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,469
consumption language I'd like to have a

86
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,560
cottage cultivation license I'd like to

87
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:25,408
be the guy to you know have the medical

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,180
and recreational dispensaries somewhere

89
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:34,168
on route 27 if those people all started

90
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:37,709
getting vocal then the town council

91
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:39,569
would start to listen get educated turn

92
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,789
to the Board of Supervisors and say

93
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:44,399
things like hey those ten retail

94
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:46,978
licenses either one we want one in

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,229
sapega or you got to up it to eleven

96
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,900
because we want to have a consumption

97
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,989
and a retail establishment in saveco

98
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,389
so Topanga Canyon itself there is so

99
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,919
much opportunity there in it's not even

100
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,939
just the opportunity as addressing there

101
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,769
is obviously a market that has been in

102
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:06,539
existence there for a while personal or

103
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,400
otherwise going in there

104
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,620
the climate is excellent the land is

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,719
excellent for cultivation again personal

106
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,099
or commercial going in there perhaps not

107
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,288
to where you will have you know acres

108
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:18,358
and acres of agro but this is where you

109
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:20,310
have something such as a cottage license

110
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,658
that can come into effect the state had

111
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,098
allowed for what's called a cottage

112
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:25,468
license that was really kind of more

113
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:26,479
intended for I think almost like a

114
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:28,879
garage side

115
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,860
crow and so someone that could roll

116
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,180
necessarily on their property with the

117
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,310
rights you know parameters that would go

118
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,810
with Lots those parameters are still to

119
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,399
be determined and can be determined by

120
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,649
the county as well too

121
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,509
we saw that as something that could be a

122
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:43,759
very good stimulus to the economy in

123
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:44,870
general within the county so we made the

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,240
committee the committee had made a

125
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,519
recommendation saying that the county

126
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,290
should prioritize cottage licences and

127
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,509
see if they could get more of those

128
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,860
online because that would be of smaller

129
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:56,779
people and opportunity to actually have

130
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,129
a living for that so you have somewhere

131
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,559
like the panga Canyon that you know you

132
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:02,569
could have 30 40 you know individuals

133
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,189
smaller farmers that could come together

134
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,290
or whatever they want to do in that in

135
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:07,879
and actually make a market out there and

136
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,090
a business that could be supporting

137
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,350
about the community or going beyond that

138
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:20,599
but that's just one license knife

139
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:24,200
obviously I have four acres on my four

140
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,960
acres I could apply for a permit get a

141
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:29,930
license put the security in place and

142
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,909
all that stuff and basically grow 1,500

143
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,300
square feet of cannabis on my property

144
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:38,660
legally legally were then I could

145
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,370
theoretically bring it to the one retail

146
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:45,770
outlet in Topanga sell it to them as my

147
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,590
finest craft cannabis and then they sell

148
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:51,229
it to my overall community who loves the

149
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:58,069
fact that it's local outdoor organic

150
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:59,900
heirloom craft cannabis that is a it's

151
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,730
it's a very real market that can exist

152
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:03,560
there that the current regulations do

153
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,569
not supports or allow for in any way

154
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,370
shape or form so Topanga Canyon could be

155
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:09,139
known very well for a Crafts style

156
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,970
cannabis they could be known for a

157
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,919
farmers market kind of event as well

158
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,180
there too it could be something that

159
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,500
where you can promote really healthy

160
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,759
product way along with the healthy

161
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,529
lifestyle that many of the residents

162
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,810
that there are already you know into of

163
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:23,299
course and so if they had the

164
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,920
opportunity to go to grow 1,500 square

165
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,120
feet or whatever was on their on their

166
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,069
properties in there you know that's

167
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,340
smaller cultivation on there this is an

168
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:33,560
opportunity to give people a benefit for

169
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:34,969
them economically but also who knows

170
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,829
what also could do for the town itself

171
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,350
that would be awesome like for me that

172
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,389
is the spirit of what I

173
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,420
folks prop 64 would be up and down the

174
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,849
coast yeah so Topanga could be like you

175
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,250
know fuck the Bud Light we don't have a

176
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:51,160
McDonald's in Topanga we don't have a

177
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,949
Budweiser store right it's all about

178
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,310
crafts and art like Topanga is craft and

179
00:06:53,949 --> 00:07:01,990
artisanal everything yeah right yeah for

180
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:04,509
this awesome vision to happen people in

181
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:08,620
Topanga need to start getting in the

182
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:11,079
ears of the town council to be like this

183
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,740
is how we want Canada's to play out in

184
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,870
sapega

185
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,060
absolutely come you need to help us get

186
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:20,439
that because it's not it statewide

187
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:22,060
it's from a state policy level it's

188
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,699
totally realistic we're not dreaming

189
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,910
here like the state says we can create

190
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:30,459
it Topanga a utopia well said absolutely

191
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,020
absolutely so you know I on that note I

192
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:34,839
mean there is there's so much

193
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:36,129
opportunity for Topanga and other

194
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,319
communities let's say Topanga Canyon

195
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:40,449
itself for Topanga can to essentially

196
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,240
make a market that could be anything

197
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:44,319
that they want it to be but it's only

198
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,079
gonna get there if they come out to

199
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,519
voice their opinion you have a few

200
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,259
people that have had the supervisors

201
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:51,789
ears and the surpriser feels that that

202
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,099
represents that a community out there

203
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,170
and historically I think we've seen that

204
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,460
us in general you know the cannabis

205
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,350
community has just stayed in the shadows

206
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:00,819
and sometimes we have not come in there

207
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,439
and yet we've had state regulations or

208
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:05,290
just passed and given us this incredible

209
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:07,750
opportunity to create the future that we

210
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,700
want to see happening in there for

211
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,920
Topanga Canyon this can still happen

212
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,839
there is there is time still left to

213
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,460
make this happen nothing is at the end

214
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,859
yet but we are coming up close to bats

215
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:19,539
for that to happen they need to voice to

216
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,009
their town council and if not just the

217
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,300
town council they need to voice their

218
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,279
opinion directly to the Board of

219
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,379
Supervisors their supervisor Sheila

220
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,339
Kuehl if nothing else she needs to hear

221
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,170
this stuff she needs to hear that this

222
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,399
is what a community wants if the

223
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,860
community does not come out to say that

224
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,240
whatever comes in the end is gonna be

225
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,250
that and that's not something that we

226
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,750
want going forward they I don't think

227
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,038
anyone here has wanted or thought that

228
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,479
prophecies before would pass and

229
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,218
ultimately that just means a complete

230
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,229
van in your community that was not what

231
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,520
the intention was for that and if we

232
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,750
don't change these regulations if we

233
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,819
don't voice for what we wanted in our

234
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,440
communities nothing will change and that

235
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,190
ban will still be in effect

236
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,009
Topanga could be 30 plus craft

237
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:59,230
cultivators all the same people who're

238
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:00,909
you all know they're your fucking

239
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,459
neighbors that are all growing amazing

240
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:05,379
weed that you smoke right now they could

241
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:07,859
be bringing it to the monthly farmers

242
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:10,990
market they could be bringing it to

243
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,230
holding this consumption lounge and they

244
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:16,240
could be bringing it to so-and-so's

245
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,589
retail you know like liquor store versus

246
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,769
bar right now

247
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:23,170
so in kapenga you know there's there's

248
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,959
this there's a stuff that runs I think

249
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:27,909
in many people's minds what it could be

250
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,859
you could be driving up that beautiful

251
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:30,850
Canyon to begin with and you're seeing

252
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,409
everyone out there and you'd have your

253
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,839
neighbors all of you who know you're

254
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:37,539
growing on that there and you could be

255
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,089
growing legally you could be making this

256
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:42,149
amazing practice craft product that is

257
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:44,949
specific to Topanga Canyon itself

258
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:47,649
something to be very proud of and you

259
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:48,969
can bring this out into a legal markets

260
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:50,740
such as a farmers market where you can

261
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,930
give to everyone else on there you can

262
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,039
see this to where it goes into a on-site

263
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:55,239
consumption like a lounge where you

264
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:57,419
could actually go and consume with your

265
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,948
friends and your neighbors on that

266
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,809
exactly right next time I'm OSA and and

267
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:04,568
it could it could also be it could be

268
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:06,458
also they have a infused dinner

269
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:07,778
experience up there as well - there's so

270
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,849
many opportunities that can come from

271
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:11,919
this down here that would that would

272
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,000
just stimulate just a lifestyle in

273
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,349
general that comes in there and people

274
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,179
like to see the stuff and it's something

275
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,589
to be even more proud of for that for

276
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:19,059
that market that a niche market that's

277
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:21,220
come in there that kind of is like this

278
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:23,799
only happens to paying a cane and the

279
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,290
laws are there to support it if we want

280
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,849
them to be and if they are coming into

281
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:29,198
the fact that the residents are asking

282
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,699
to myself if they're pushing their town

283
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:33,159
council if the supervisors are hearing

284
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:34,508
that stuff we can't create these laws we

285
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,458
have this opportunity we've got the

286
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:38,019
voice of Supervisors ears they need to

287
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:40,028
know more specifics behind what's being

288
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,039
done these are currently recommendations

289
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:43,539
only that are out there but if we aren't

290
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:45,639
coming out there saying hey this is what

291
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:47,649
I want in my community it

292
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,000
if the panga has an incredible

293
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:53,309
opportunity for that stuff in there and

294
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,309
if they can make that that's way shit

295
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:02,649
