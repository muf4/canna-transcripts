[Music]

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:12,539
what I always found interesting was like

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:16,378
you know centuries of tradition and then

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:19,500
someone's like what if I did this and it

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:23,429
led to kind of this like every day I'm

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,839
on Instagram I see some new person and I

7
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,358
don't mean this in a bad way

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,980
like being inspired and just loving it

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,359
and being like I love doing this and

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:37,739
then you know you have everything from I

11
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:41,070
actually brought some of Ben's winning

12
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,988
solvent list that he had given me two

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,980
weeks ago so so it's also kind of like

14
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:48,179
innovation in almost like consistency my

15
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:50,849
game yesterday

16
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,429
yeah that's why when he posted that

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:58,070
picture I was like she's in LA he was

18
00:00:53,429 --> 00:01:01,109
like yeah and I was like all right but

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,058
so can you give kind of the quick back

20
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,450
story of could because it's two things

21
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:10,019
one is kind of the automated almost like

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,728
you automated dry sift but then were you

23
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,149
the first person to do it in ice water

24
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:18,090
too so like you had the first person to

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,969
do an ice water but to figure out that

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,310
the bags was the simplest way to do it

27
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,590
the nice way and I said so other people

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,780
were doing it just noose no they were

29
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,118
they made this big machine that was all

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,478
made of steel and wood and cost a bloody

31
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,670
fortune and I just shipped down six down

32
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,280
to Australia which cost even more of a

33
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,070
fortune and the problem was they'd all

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,868
be made in check ER you were Slavia and

35
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:44,339
at the bottom where there was this

36
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:46,799
plastic funnel

37
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,460
they all exploded so is this what do you

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,610
want for yeah that's the judge yeah yeah

39
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:56,339
but I mean so if you think of when you

40
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:59,159
were in like India what was that 40

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,070
years ago or 30 years ago civilian which

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,440
is you know either a brick or a temple

43
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:07,289
ball to kind of the innovation and

44
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,329
consistency that you're seeing now like

45
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,270
are you excited to see kind of people

46
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,850
playing with I think it's excellent it

47
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,950
would not be right if people were still

48
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,989
only using the dry sift and the bags

49
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:21,089
right it's a very good thing that the

50
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,620
innovation is happening whichever

51
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,920
direction it's played

52
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,340
taking it solvent DeRozan I must say I

53
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:32,339
prefer the rosin to the solvent but it's

54
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,989
moving you know in any industry I don't

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,830
build houses like they did a hundred

56
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:42,090
years ago even the doctor has a lot more

57
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:44,100
happening for him to use them so with

58
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,840
this also it's going to evolve and I

59
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:50,609
don't know exactly where it's gonna be

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,069
going but I feel kind of funny and proud

61
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,650
to be the kind of beginning of it or

62
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,959
yeah with that machine because that was

63
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,360
the first mechanized system to separate

64
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:05,360
the glass and that was in what year I

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:09,420
wasn't actually I invented it in 92 93

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,510
but I didn't open a company until early

67
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:15,268
94 so this year actually at the New

68
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:17,429
Year's Eve will be around for 25 years

69
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,469
but when you first did it and then you

70
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,739
showed other people were they like that

71
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:25,680
genius when we first did it basically I

72
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,349
built a machine for myself because I

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,260
because I wanted some good house and I

74
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:35,069
lived in India for 14 years and traveled

75
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:36,810
Pakistan Afghanistan me Bob Kashmir so I

76
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,659
knew how her she was made in different

77
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,280
regions and then came back to Holland

78
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,799
and suddenly the whole city is filled

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,550
with coffee shops that sell weed

80
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,610
and I'd never encountered me to smoke in

81
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:53,730
the 23 years I had been smoking ash

82
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,830
in the hash producing countries yeah so

83
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:58,019
I find that interesting that yeah but

84
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,020
when there's smoke the flower at all in

85
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:05,730
any of those countries all the way all

86
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:08,880
the way from Morocco all the way to

87
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:12,569
China in the Stephanie in the northern

88
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,509
Han area and else more cash maybe in

89
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:18,149
places like Thailand and South India

90
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:21,480
there will be some Reed being smoked but

91
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,849
because when then 64 I started smoking

92
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,770
in Amsterdam there was also no weed

93
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,629
there was only hash and it came from the

94
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:30,029
sailors you know they traded with

95
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:32,219
Lebanon Pakistan and brought some

96
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:35,159
echelon for themselves to so and I got

97
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,400
to him stung and that's how we got first

98
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,160
house so I never tasted weed all my

99
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,219
travels there was always only hash and I

100
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,380
must say I did I think one time try and

101
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,420
smoke the manali weed and thought it was

102
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:53,519
awful compared to the house right so

103
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:59,040
that was one time or so so all right so

104
00:04:53,519 --> 00:05:03,199
you you create kind of be the dry sift

105
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:08,790
and then who did you first see washing

106
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:12,569
no the first news about water came from

107
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:14,310
the states like Jericho is doing it

108
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:19,589
tomorrow

109
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:22,350
what's its name tomorrow he was into the

110
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:26,639
terpenes like ten years before anyone

111
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:28,830
else that are geared of them he was the

112
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,019
first one that I got worried that he was

113
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:33,930
using water but it was just in the glass

114
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:36,089
and there was no mention of ice he just

115
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,959
put water and your product in there and

116
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:42,449
stirred it up a bit and we did it made a

117
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,399
big mess in the kitchen I was doing this

118
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:48,959
with Annie Rickon who used to work for

119
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:51,870
the High Times and there were actually

120
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,569
some crystals because the crystals are

121
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:57,209
heavier heavier than plant matter so

122
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:59,579
they will always sink right at the

123
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:01,439
bottom but by the time we got all that

124
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:07,769
water and plant matter out there was a

125
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:09,990
negligible part we retreat yeah but from

126
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:15,439
that slowly slowly then this machine

127
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:18,840
came out to maybe about six months later

128
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:22,709
and not because it showed it had a

129
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,989
stainless steel bucket with a like a

130
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:27,539
stirrer

131
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,579
like a pancake stirrer on it and then

132
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,680
his screen and then this plastic funnel

133
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,649
with a cute little bottle hanging at the

134
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,930
bottom and it was great except all of

135
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:41,339
them broke and I was just racking my

136
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:44,100
brains how can I do this system through

137
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,889
the screen in the water with ice by then

138
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:51,330
we'd figured that out and just stick it

139
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:53,849
in an envelope and my career started as

140
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:57,418
owning a boutique so I knew all about

141
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:01,350
clothes and clothes and sewing so how to

142
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:03,240
get a screen horizontal in a bucket yeah

143
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,820
you make the cloth that hangs over the

144
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,389
pocket so I stitched the very first ones

145
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:13,189
myself that I've now donated to a mobile

146
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,189
ash Museum in all

147
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,968
and so yeah and then later on actually

148
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:22,968
we ourselves were using the washing

149
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:25,788
machine and that's my last type of

150
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:27,949
product in this line because washing

151
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:30,740
machines were invented to wash your

152
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:33,919
dirty socks clean and for a washing

153
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:37,009
machine to have plant material in there

154
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,779
with ice and everything it does a

155
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,389
perfect job you know it watches those

156
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:43,609
crystals off and they end up in the

157
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:47,870
runaway water and that you couldn't

158
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:51,770
catch in the bags and so you created the

159
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,389
bags and what was the reaction to kind

160
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:56,478
of that innovation where people like

161
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:59,210
that's also genius like you are smoke

162
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,728
more weed and come up with more ideas no

163
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:03,859
no no the first time I remember we had a

164
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:05,959
booth I think it was maybe in

165
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,110
Switzerland or even an island I forget

166
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,839
and I'd hung the whole booth with bags

167
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,150
and every single person walked by they

168
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,278
knew me from the pollinator from the dry

169
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:19,370
set machine and they just thought I'd

170
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:22,009
gone mad and they didn't see at all

171
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:27,588
oh these bag work they just saw all

172
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:29,990
these bags hanging there but then slowly

173
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:32,838
slowly magazines caught on and wrote

174
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:35,360
about it and so me was a great lover of

175
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:39,349
the bags originally so that really

176
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:44,810
helped promote it yeah very cool and and

177
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:48,470
then when I think of kind of innovations

178
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:51,289
and consistency was there like a good

179
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,990
decade where was mostly just people

180
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:55,879
doing ice water hash and making temple

181
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,980
balls and then you like what when did

182
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,019
you first start ice what actually don't

183
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,959
make bricks and temple bows it's too

184
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:05,060
precious why that light like French he

185
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,518
makes temple balls right he definitely

186
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:09,768
uses ice water well that's not old and

187
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,230
traditional and all my travels in

188
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:14,810
Afghanistan and Pakistan I never saw

189
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,670
anyone use water apart when they had

190
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:19,859
sifted the crystals

191
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:22,259
sometimes they'd spit in it sometimes

192
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,620
they'd put a little water in it just to

193
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:28,350
knead it together but I never ever saw

194
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:34,980
it personally anyway I guess my question

195
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:37,560
is when when the kind of ice water first

196
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,600
came on the scene yeah what was kind of

197
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,619
the end consistency because now there's

198
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,170
a variety of inconsistencies it should

199
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,659
come out like that and if they are not

200
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:51,719
greedy and much too long or sake too

201
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:55,049
long because that's when the chlorophyll

202
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,889
starts coming into it I always stop way

203
00:09:55,049 --> 00:10:01,259
before it starts going green it should

204
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:05,939
look I like caviar and this in the

205
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:08,278
temperature of LA has melted somewhat so

206
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,920
it's kind of oiled together but you can

207
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,078
still see the separate crystals and if

208
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:14,399
it was still dry if it had been kept in

209
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:17,370
the fridge the whole time

210
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,610
white would look like caviar you can see

211
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:23,820
if you have a microphone microscope or

212
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,399
nearly with your eye you can see it's

213
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,160
just built up of little crystals where

214
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,500
on the top you know if it's pressed it's

215
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:33,809
gonna be smooth but there you see the

216
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,320
crystals okay and I think is just melted

217
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,729
in the heat

218
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,010
Harger that's why it's all together now

219
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:45,149
smells good though it's very nice

220
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:49,230
so-so I voted for him in my and I didn't

221
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:52,078
even know and he was so nice because Ben

222
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,278
who came to the show he was the one who

223
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,669
had made it I know

224
00:10:53,278 --> 00:11:01,049
yes but then they had yet to be here do

225
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:03,419
something bad so he couldn't go to Miami

226
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:05,259
so I was so sad and he said it was his

227
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:10,879
first prize ever

228
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:13,549
what is it in absentia yeah so you kind

229
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,980
of innovated on the equipment side yeah

230
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:18,620
and then a lot of people copied you

231
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,930
a lot of people copied me and something

232
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:24,379
that I make you feel it used to make me

233
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:27,649
very mad and then I remembered I used to

234
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:30,049
have a friend in the clothing business

235
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:33,980
in New Delhi when I lived in India and

236
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:37,099
we euros used to say to be copied is the

237
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,649
best compliment you can get so I kind of

238
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,629
have to make do with that and it's not

239
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:43,699
worth it to earn myself up about it

240
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:49,159
because the only one who suffers from

241
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:51,740
that is me right you know nobody so

242
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:56,778
that's just plain stupid to sit there

243
00:11:51,740 --> 00:12:00,560
and so in terms of your business

244
00:11:56,778 --> 00:12:03,679
focus now is what percentage of your

245
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,959
time are you focused on kind of selling

246
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,479
the equipment and then you're also

247
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,610
running the dabba-doo stuff how many'd

248
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,610
avenues are there let's say let's say 20

249
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:15,289
19 how many are there Miami just

250
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,570
happened you're about to go to yeah this

251
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:20,179
year though just be 5 because we didn't

252
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,190
it's difficult to find a location to do

253
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:25,429
it in Helen no because in the

254
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:29,240
Netherlands extracts are illegal so to

255
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:31,489
an even resin they don't see that it's

256
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,159
not really an extract that is just so

257
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,919
cash is illegal and no matter ash like

258
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,500
this made with water because it's a

259
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:42,439
siphon so solvent lists extracts are

260
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,440
okay solvent is not okay so the thing is

261
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,110
that no business at the moment wants to

262
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,480
rent to us to do this because they're

263
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,539
scared of losing their license you know

264
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,000
if they let us be there with all the

265
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:58,490
sovereigns and DeRosa and few hundred

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,860
people so we haven't found a place in

267
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,589
Holland because that dab sorry dabba-doo

268
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,690
also has a solvents category right yeah

269
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:07,880
okay that is three kind of ghosts even

270
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,070
though you're I mean do you smoke salt

271
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:13,879
like do you smoke live resin

272
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:17,120
also know I smoke the the I prefer these

273
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,759
water hash to any other thing but if

274
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,828
somebody handed you some hydrocarbon

275
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,440
I've tasted riot

276
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:27,948
I'll try definitely I'll try to sing our

277
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,779
appreciation or not I don't like when it

278
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:33,049
starts tasting of chemicals you know

279
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:34,939
that but nowadays they die think they do

280
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:37,879
gain them better because it's not so

281
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,819
obvious so as you I mean it's kind of

282
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:43,490
interesting because you and I think like

283
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:45,919
Nick and even like Ben and these guys

284
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,278
you're all kind of traveled the world

285
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:51,169
and so you get this my best student he

286
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,259
came to me right in the beginning and we

287
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:57,049
sat for days that's what I really liked

288
00:13:54,259 --> 00:14:01,129
you know and he went far beyond you know

289
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:04,250
goes beyond what I did so what what has

290
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:07,278
he done that you're like proud of your

291
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,528
student like what what things have you

292
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,439
seen him do where you're like the way he

293
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:15,919
says he sees a person and he just only

294
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,899
makes it he refuses to do any second

295
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:21,620
grade he only wants to make top great

296
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:24,740
stuff and for sure he does it with a lot

297
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,078
of care and more care than most people

298
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,909
at home will have and so it's definitely

299
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:31,818
a much better quality and it's

300
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:35,149
interesting because hash as a business

301
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:37,250
if you want to adhere to those high

302
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,379
standards you kind of by default have to

303
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,500
be a small business because there's not

304
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:47,169
enough quality source material you know

305
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,169
to keep the levels up all the time yeah

306
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:57,739
and so is this your preferred like you

307
00:14:55,428 --> 00:15:03,048
like to smoke spliffs basically yes

308
00:14:57,739 --> 00:15:06,649
because that's in Europe so I lived in

309
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:09,769
France for two years and everybody's

310
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:11,599
once Jones Spears yeah and coming from

311
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:14,839
the US where you're ripping tubes you

312
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:18,559
know your your bongs and proto pipes and

313
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:21,769
baddies and join these dubbing rigs and

314
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:24,198
if it would knock me over the head but

315
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:26,749
then interestingly if I offer them flour

316
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:29,389
like here let's roll a joint they'd be

317
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:33,019
like whoa that is way too powerful for

318
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:34,519
us I don't smoke it pure they also had

319
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:36,619
some tobacco to their flour

320
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,589
yeah right yeah that's your opinion wait

321
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:44,599
so when I started smoking like that 55

322
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:47,329
years ago and still smoke like and how

323
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:48,649
many and but do you smoke tobacco by

324
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:50,688
itself are you ever like I just need it

325
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,308
so it's always used to yeah but and so

326
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:54,978
now you just smoke explicit and how many

327
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:56,958
do you think you smoke a day well at the

328
00:15:54,979 --> 00:16:00,649
moment I'm on a program to lessen the

329
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,418
the tobacco my doctor's order no no no

330
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:04,908
no no my my own cell phones

331
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:06,708
yes now according to my doctor I'm fine

332
00:16:04,908 --> 00:16:09,318
and healthy and he refuses to give me

333
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:16,068
any kind of piece of paper than for

334
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:18,588
medical use but so every packet of

335
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:22,218
tobacco i buy these european packets I

336
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:24,889
give myself point one gram less for that

337
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:27,528
whole packet so at the beginning of the

338
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:31,489
year I was up to five six grams a day

339
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:33,229
and now I'm down to 1.7 gram of tobacco

340
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:35,719
it like the same amount of hash per day

341
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:38,869
I'm not trying to cut the hash but yeah

342
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:41,239
for sure it's less so how's that 1.7

343
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:44,389
after you go through today probably at

344
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:48,109
least a grammar so I never really looked

345
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:49,999
at it that much but from that 1.7 gram I

346
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:52,278
can make eight little joints so that

347
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:56,329
keeps a yeah pen are you still making

348
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:58,338
hash or you kind of all your students

349
00:16:56,328 --> 00:17:00,779
and former students are giving you what

350
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,760
they make and you just sometimes in

351
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,889
I have to go to the coffee shop and buy

352
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,650
it and I can't even afford the best

353
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,350
quality make you buy and I can't even

354
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,570
afford to buy their best quality nice

355
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:15,929

356

money that's bad sometimes I'm giving

357
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,930
something and a lot of former people who

358
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,340

coming here I'm arriving two days later

376
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:14,700
in Colombia so but this way at least

377
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,500
I'll be late

378
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,900
no no actually I'll be there for the

379
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,579
beginning of that I have to just have

380
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,980
you been to Colombia oh yes several

381
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,990
times so tell me about the scene that

382
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,610
your seat whether it's the cultivation

383
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:34,680
scene the cash scene the social scene in

384
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:36,869
these different more cities yeah I don't

385
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,299
like cities much if there is any spare

386
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:41,339
time I prefer to go out in the woods or

387
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:45,960
in the wild or something and see

388
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:50,399
something of the countryside but I think

389
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:53,100
everywhere now is Oh idea of making a

390
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,430
she's just growing quite explosive flip

391
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,659
yeah the other day somebody gave me my

392
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:01,799
best compliment ever

393
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:04,058
I guess Mila started at making ash and

394
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,528
all world followed right

395
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:11,210
it's not quite like you're like the Pied

396
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:14,619
Piper but I think with this machine it

397
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:17,808
did start also not only copied me but

398
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:20,989
God people got other inventions on the

399
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:23,418
road and you know the whole all the

400
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:27,980
equipment for the extracts or that label

401
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:31,009
on the tab rigs and the dye breaks some

402
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:35,179
fantastic dye breaks but I'm not really

403
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:38,138
a dimer for me it's like smoking two old

404
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:40,519
joints in one puff right and then also

405
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:42,528
although now I've learned how to get

406
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:46,278
around that the way that people cough

407
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:48,259
after taking your dime sometime my 74

408
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:52,609
year old lungs can't deal with that

409
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:55,700
maybe once but not too often some people

410
00:19:52,609 --> 00:20:00,769
go that way and then say that was a good

411
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:02,569
one they embrace the cop it's like the

412
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:05,659
more painful the cough the better it is

413
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:09,349
for you exactly well I don't want those

414
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:13,130
painful cops anymore so it's alright but

415
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:15,918
talk talk about like I'm dying to go

416
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,700

417
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,700

421
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,889

00:20:56,778 --> 00:21:01,609
cultivator as a friend

432
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:04,429

433
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:06,439
there I mean all these paper people who

434
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:09,269

you know without them it wouldn't be

437
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:17,759
happening and I know how much work it is

438
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:20,729
to put anything like that together then

439
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,259
I know al gato from Colombia already

440
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,870
since 89

441
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:27,480
when he phoned me from Modena and said

442
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:29,609
I'm phoning you from Eddie and I wonder

443
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,819
word of the biggest pollinator drive

444
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:35,879
submission you got I said okay I need a

445
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:38,159
credit card and a Andros and sure enough

446
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,970
five minutes later cause back credit

447
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,500
card and this guy has grown so much weed

448
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,900
in South America the way it took him

449
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:53,910
five months to get the credit card the

450
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:56,820
five minutes oh five minutes credit card

451
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:59,430
or a bang you had that and then first he

452
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:01,289
was going in Colombia and he showed me

453
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,690
this beautiful footage of how he's

454
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:05,399
riding to his mountain side that girl

455
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:09,630
mountain signs on there and his horse

456
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:13,440
just lovely and then he moved to Mexico

457
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,960
Brazil and I think he but wherever he

458
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,990
moved to and started growing he needed

459
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:23,250
my machines he was making Irish quite a

460
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:25,769
big way and he's a close friend yeah

461
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,049
where's he live now he lives in Colombia

462
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:31,019
so he's back in Colombia yeah he was in

463
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:34,319
Barcelona for a while but he's Colombian

464
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:36,539
I think he feels at home and yet and

465
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,119
I'll be staying with him after the

466
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:41,460

school people from the Amsterdam scene

475
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:11,548

right I mean we were all kind of more or

480
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:24,178
less there from the beginning so every

481
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,869
High Times cup we'd run into each other

482
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:30,990
every spannabis we'd run into each other

483
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:35,609
some of these guys I saw more away from

484
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:38,159
him stop and that's the time but we all

485
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:41,069
known each other for like 20 years 25

486
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,220
years though so most of them are still

487
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:45,089
going strong some of them have dropped

488
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,710
along the way

489
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:50,849
some of them are living on tropical

490
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:54,720
islands now can't be bothered don't need

491
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:57,480
to so talk about kind of the

492
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,819
corporatization of it's not just of

493
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,690
cannabis but like for example the High

494
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:06,898
Times event last night when you first

495
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,669
were on the high time scene it was

496
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:10,558
probably a lot different people than

497
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:12,870
you're seeing there today where like now

498
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,700
it's kind of like finance guys who own

499
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:18,288
it and run it and are basically

500
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:21,990
co-opting kind of but I was at the grow

501
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:23,879
Expo in Holland a few months ago and

502
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,899
everybody's also walking around in suits

503
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:31,440
with ties on and hemisphere has changed

504
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:33,449
no I was fair you talked to CEOs instead

505
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,259
of someone who's an theistic about his

506
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,259
new treatments

507
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:41,259
before you go up to a board and he'd say

508
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,539
oh man you gotta try my stuff you'll get

509
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:48,339
the best puns ever now you're having to

510
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:51,460
deal with the senior it's just different

511
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:56,079
and maybe for me personally I preferred

512
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:59,350
it the old way but yeah I mean that's

513
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:01,329
the world times change I watch TV here

514
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:03,279
the last couple of evenings and it's

515
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:07,649
just boggling what's all going on

516
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:12,069
so besides Nick who are kind of some

517
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:16,930
hash makers that yeah this cut though he

518
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:23,950
makes also great times but so does Ben

519
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:25,720
you know and actually in Miami who is

520
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,680
quite to be quite difficult in a way

521
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,809
because none of them we're really bad

522
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:36,640
and as you're trying to pick from all

523
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:39,279
good entry yeah well one was better than

524
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,330
the other about but when you're judging

525
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:46,690
I don't like to judge I'm such a bad

526
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:49,899
judge how are you consuming are you are

527
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:52,360
you putting it spliff of each type and

528
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,670
put a number on it and then smoke a bit

529
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,409
of each one and then decide which one I

530
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,300
like best of which I like how many

531
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,250
entrants were there for this

532
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:02,470
they were only five okay so you're not

533
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,589
smoking like thirty splits sometimes

534
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:07,839
have to about usually actually I don't

535
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:11,049
fart I just like to be the hostess and

536
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:14,199
talk to people and hang out with him but

537
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:16,240
they got me so each judge gets to smoke

538
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,299
it and however they prefer to smoke it

539
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,440
so if I'm a spliff smoker if I'm a

540
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:25,710
dabber if I'm on whatever

541
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,710
most of them dab it most lived a bit too

542
00:26:25,808 --> 00:26:31,239
yeah so but like I say I'm such about

543
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,090
the judge I don't really like to be in

544
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:36,308
charge I went through those five and

545
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:38,348
decided to immerse worse than which one

546
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:40,989
was best went through them again and

547
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:44,019
completely changed my mind you know and

548
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:47,769
then after the third time I had to come

549
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:49,319
to some decision and the first one was

550
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:52,899
quite obvious but it was especially

551
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:55,058
about the two that came after that so

552
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:58,178
getting back to like the traditional

553
00:26:55,058 --> 00:27:01,118
hash producing countries because I think

554
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:03,940
a lot of what people talk about is kind

555
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:07,538
of the Dutch seeds basically like jingis

556
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:10,749
khan impregnating all the females and

557
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:13,329
mixing and creating hybrid bastards and

558
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:15,219
all those countries so like what what

559
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:17,408
were some of the experiences that really

560
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:20,169
stand out for you in terms of like I was

561
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:23,289
in the mountains of this region and we

562
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:25,599
smoke some hash and it was just the most

563
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:27,548
amazing thing I've ever had and and I

564
00:27:25,598 --> 00:27:29,468
can't find it since then like is there

565
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:32,378
something that you can't find today that

566
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:34,210
well I must say about that I really kind

567
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:38,138
of feel bad that all these people are

568
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:40,929
taking their homey seeds to Afghanistan

569
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:42,728
to everywhere and I'm sure in the end

570
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:45,489
the whole world will just be like one

571
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:47,919
standard if it goes on like this because

572
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:51,489
like a Manali Valley it's a valley so if

573
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,739
somebody planted 20 cookie bones or

574
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:55,149
white widow or whatever it's gonna

575
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:57,129
affect all the plants in the whole

576
00:27:55,148 --> 00:28:00,128
valley in the end might take a couple

577
00:27:57,128 --> 00:28:03,248
generations but it will so I find that

578
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:06,638
very sad but I did have one of my best

579
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:10,569
experiences there in the same Manali

580
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:13,058
Valley in sixties late 60s when I got

581
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:16,178
there we used to hang out with many of

582
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:18,878
the satyrs the holy men with their hair

583
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:23,889
on top that smoked chilies all day long

584
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:28,299
in respect for Shiva and that took us up

585
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:31,729
into the mountains do rub but I will

586
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:33,919
for us yes and I didn't like in the

587
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:37,430
valley you adore these big green plants

588
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,430
like meters high they weren't into that

589
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:42,529
and they took us up and we found two of

590
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:44,330
these like a little Dell in the

591
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:46,759
mountainside that was like a little

592
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:50,359
Hollow and it had been filled with snow

593
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:53,269
the whole winter and underneath the

594
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:55,219
marijuana plants had survived now they

595
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:58,730
weren't shooting up meters high they

596
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:01,850
were like bonsais old crinkly and woody

597
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:03,890
and not only that this is during harvest

598
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:06,559
season like in october/november or this

599
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:09,440
is this was a weary no no this was in

600
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,639
October okay and the bugs weren't very

601
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,140
big either they were like this size and

602
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,590
each plant would have quite a number of

603
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:20,750
parts anyway we're up - there and then

604
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:23,449
with the satyrs they made the Chilam

605
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:26,420
immediately so I realized also that's

606
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:32,210
probably some of the few times that I've

607
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:35,600
smoked our so freshly that the THC a is

608
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:37,490
still very much there anyway we smoked a

609
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,189
couple of chilies up there and walking

610
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:43,009
down that mountain it was like an acid

611
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:45,650
trip the way the brook was bubbling next

612
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:50,059
to ours and the way the colors were Lee

613
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:53,480
was just amazing yeah that was the but

614
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:55,490
any other thing I always say this small

615
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,009
joint I'm smoking right now is the best

616
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:03,109
because all the rest is in the past or

617
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:05,480
in the future yes

618
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:08,089
so have you gone back to some of those

619
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,990
regions and visited old friends and yeah

620
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:15,019
and you know Kashmir and no in Manali

621
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:17,480
like I used to go trekking a lot with my

622
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:19,220
kids because they went to school there

623
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,019
so in the most summer we'd go trekking

624
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:25,029
and this is like in the seventies or

625
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:27,970
yeah in the seventies eighties and

626
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:30,970
a lot of times we went with this one guy

627
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:33,460
who owned five or six horses and put all

628
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:39,250
the food and the tents on there and we'd

629
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:41,679
walk and he's in my book and so I sent

630
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:44,048
him a book and it actually made it so

631
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,519
that's so nice he can't read English but

632
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:47,259
he can look at the pictures and there's

633
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,349
a picture of him in there that's fine

634
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:53,408
yeah well I guess the question I'm asked

635
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:55,779
or I'm going to ask is what do you

636
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:57,520
think's the future for those people

637
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:59,440
right like these are because now you

638
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,720
have all these like I mean here in LA

639
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:06,009
you have all these young kids making

640
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:08,829
hash and it was a global market like it

641
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:10,750
is they're in a and the other question

642
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:12,699
there are those people doing some of the

643
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:16,690
in a still dry sifting or are they all

644
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:18,819
making ice water hash now - I went

645
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:22,600
because my assistant decided to make a

646
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:24,069
documentary and it was about me so we

647
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:26,769
went back to some of these old places

648
00:31:24,069 --> 00:31:29,168
and actually met some of the same people

649
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:31,418
but they're still doing exactly the same

650
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:37,870
that they were like thirty years earlier

651
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:42,009
so they're still dry safety rubbing or

652
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:44,439
right in there but the thing is what I

653
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:49,269
realized when I was there 30 35 years

654
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:52,390
ago nothing had changed in 500 years

655
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:55,269
there was more change in those 35 years

656
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:57,190
than there had been in the preceding 500

657
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:59,048
you know when I we went there there was

658
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:01,480
just walking paths from one village to

659
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:04,538
the next now there's roads buses

660
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,058
electricity more schools more hospitals

661
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:08,740
but all the young kids there want to get

662
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:13,149
into the tourist trade and drive around

663
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:18,279
energy forget about that they want to be

664
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:20,590
a GP anyway it's very sad because a lot

665
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:26,440
of the tradition will get lost this way

666
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:28,658
do you still smoke try sift yes and how

667
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,509
would you like one do you like dry sift

668
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:33,159
like do you just appreciate both and

669
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:35,440
they're both great like I just want

670
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,990
verses dry sift or tell you for me what

671
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,690
the differ

672
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:43,140
maybe Frenchie negative we have

673
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:48,330
different opinion but for me when you

674
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:49,980
make if people like the aroma and with

675
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:52,408
the smell and the taste is most

676
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,750
important to them when they smoke they

677
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:56,610
should take dry sift because I believe

678
00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:00,179
probably a lot of the terpenes are on

679
00:32:56,609 --> 00:33:02,158
the outside of the trichome and so all

680
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,769
the water soluble ones will get washed

681
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,340
off in the water

682
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:12,210
the sad part of it is then the dry sift

683
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:15,288
that very quickly the little sticks will

684
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:18,409
start coming through the screen also and

685
00:33:15,288 --> 00:33:21,480
you can do a lot of work and remove them

686
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:26,010
but if I smoke it like that it kind of

687
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,919
tastes fuzzy now with water hash there's

688
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,609
not as much many terpenes there's no

689
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,309
mistakes

690
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:36,089
it tastes less it smells less but it's

691
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:38,908
stronger so I prefer that but they each

692
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:41,369
have trade-offs right like there's there

693
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:43,649
there's no Holy Grail one has more

694
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:47,398
flavor and terpenes the other as pure

695
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:49,678
and just has more strength it is a bit

696
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:52,798
like that probably if you mix the two

697
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,320
you get the perfect thing but I just

698
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:59,929
like it like this and it's stronger than

699
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:06,740
the dry sift although I must say that in

700
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:10,019
Miami Cuban Cuban grower growers wife

701
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:13,108
send me some dry stuff that she had made

702
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:14,608
and that was very good but it was so

703
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:16,769
good there was definitely no no the

704
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:18,869
sticks in it and in the temperature it

705
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:21,389
melted just like this and got just like

706
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:23,010
this now do you if people are gifting

707
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:26,730
you stuff everywhere are you traveling

708
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:28,589
with it no ok so you guys I never do so

709
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,628
whenever whatever you for whatever you

710
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:33,029
don't know you'll give to these two

711
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:36,118
lucky or three lucky you guys over there

712
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:39,109

716
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,489
