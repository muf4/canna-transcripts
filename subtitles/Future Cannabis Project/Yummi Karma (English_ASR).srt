[Music]

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,519
um we're with yummy Karma it's we focus

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,720
on Edibles topicals and tinctures um

4
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,320
where we are a little different than a

5
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,558
lot of people is that we're our Target

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,238
is women um and a lot of people asked us

7
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,439
when we got into the industry why

8
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,439
because I mean a lot of people kind of

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,199
have this idea of what a cannabis user

10
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,920
looks like um you know so uh we wanted

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,399
to help change the picture of the face

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,679
of cannabis we wanted to help normalize

13
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,960
the products um thank you especially

14
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,799
with a lot of you being moms and stuff

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,878
so we're going to hit on three different

16
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,279
things that we kind of want to talk

17
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,399
about tonight that we thought was

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,680
important um one of them being that

19
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,799
there was a gap in the marketplace for

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,840
women the why we started yummy K in the

21
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,960
first place and actually Jasmine Hub at

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,478
our first we were kind of thinking that

23
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,399
going in this direction and our first

24
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:20,118
women grow meeting Jasmine um you know

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sure hopefully you know who that is

26
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:25,759
um so she was the first one to stand up

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,118
and say women please let's make products

28
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,239
for us you know there is a definite lack

29
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:32,680
in the market um so

30
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:34,679
I mean two years ago when I would walk

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,880
into a collective I didn't really feel

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,320
like a lot of the products spoke to me

33
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,679
there wasn't really anything that jumped

34
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,639
out you know like we shop a lot and I

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,880
didn't have that feeling when I was in a

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,079
in the collective so um that's when we

37
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,078
started focusing on women and when you

38
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,118
think about what does that mean it

39
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:55,758
doesn't mean just making something pink

40
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,680
um yeah so we were trying to approach it

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,280
more in a way of how do we create a

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,600
product that fits into your lifestyle it

43
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,519
can be discreet especially if you have

44
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,199
children I know that can be a it's

45
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,359
almost like a shaming thing people

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,400
cannot enjoy cannabis the way they can

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,560
wine like different alcohol so that

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,599
became a major Focus for us whether it

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,120
was our branding our packaging the way

50
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,039
we looked at doing things so we're

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,039
evening the way our company runs we're

52
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,840
very approachable uh patients feel very

53
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,439
comfortable emailing us all the time

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,120
asking us questions and we answer their

55
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,359
questions we don't treat this as

56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,439
Corporate America even though we're

57
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,280
trying to fit into a really traditional

58
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,239
business model and that's what we're all

59
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,519
really asking for we want this industry

60
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,120
to be just like any other industry so

61
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,599
you have to treat it that way but I

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,920
think the great thing about everyone in

63
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,919
this room as far as Canabis is concerned

64
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,479
is we are different and we have to

65
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,479
embrace that and we have to be

66
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,719
approachable we have to answer people's

67
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:00,119
questions yeah exactly and honestly

68
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,120
women shop differently than men um we

69
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,878
did a little research if you're starting

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,000
a business you know if you're going to

71
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:06,759
do Edibles or something that's going to

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,479
be sold in the collectives I highly

73
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,000
recommend that you find someone that

74
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,039
will let you sit in their Collective for

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,360
a few hours and watch how the patients

76
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,280
engage with the we used to call them Bud

77
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,799
tenders and now they like to be called

78
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,000
cannabis Consultants

79
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,799
so it's true it's true we'll give you a

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,239
demonstration of how men shop and how

81
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,560
women shop so we have samples here

82
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
here's what a man does before she even

83
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,400
finishes what this is they're already

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,680
putting it in their mouth they walk away

85
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,239
they're like this is I haven't even told

86
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,640
them what it is a woman comes up and

87
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,280
she's like hi what's your name oh where

88
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,079
did you where are you from do you have

89
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,840
any children I do and we know their

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,519
whole life story they know every single

91
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,799
ingredient in the product how we made it

92
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,438
at what temperature what time day week

93
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,120
and everything else so there are

94
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,799
differences well cuz usually women are

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,239
more likely be like okay so how much do

96
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,319
I take and how long is it going to take

97
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,280
till it kicks in and what about this and

98
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,518
how much do I apply if it's a topical so

99
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,479
we started to realize that a lot of this

100
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,239
information wasn't on the packaging and

101
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,039
it wasn't being addressed and it wasn't

102
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,759
being taught to the Cannabis Consultants

103
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,120
it's a really hard one to break for we

104
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,240
know as centers exact we will have them

105
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,959
again one day when we have like cafes

106
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,400
you know that's what they'll be called

107
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,279
but um so that became a big part of how

108
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:32,599
do we address you know the problem Gap

109
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,918
in the market exactly so I think this

110
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,560
kind of takes us into they all kind of

111
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:37,799
lead in together so compliance was

112
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,800
something that was just talked about

113
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,360
Tracy pointed out a very good fact um we

114
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,079
all have to be good players I mean I

115
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,520
know if you look on you know your

116
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,758
Instagram or wherever you can see people

117
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:52,159
who seem to be in it for a quick Buck

118
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,879
short term they're definitely not trying

119
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,039
to focus on being around in a long time

120
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,680
from now so as far as with compliance

121
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:00,079
with what we've done including a lot of

122
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,759
legal bills

123
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,478
a lot we have like 10 lawyers yeah there

124
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,879
are things that you can start doing that

125
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:10,159
um doesn't just include which you should

126
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,800
get a lawyer for this but there's other

127
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,520
things you can do so one of the things

128
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,680
we did was we started focusing on the

129
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:19,120
Northern Market nothing against you guys

130
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,038
down here in LA but s a little easier

131
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,759
down here than getting into the club up

132
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,680
north if you're making any products

133
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,160
right so San Francisco and Berkeley are

134
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,879
way ahead on regulations whether it

135
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,039
comes to Packaging um the first time we

136
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,199
walked in with the product we were doing

137
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,519
sauce bottles and stuff I was actually

138
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,478
chased out of a collective she's she

139
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,478
stop folling a little bit I was chased

140
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,038
out of the collective by a buyer because

141
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:45,560
my packaging was not compliant yeah and

142
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,639
you don't want to have that effect

143
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,519
although that Collective did just call

144
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,160
Rec lastek yeah so we're back but um

145
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,318
there are things you can start doing

146
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,120
like for example Edibles you know you

147
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,560
see a lot of products right now that

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,120
have pictures of the edible on the

149
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,759
packaging not a good idea it's not going

150
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,399
to be legal in 2018 don't waste the

151
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,759
money into doing that you can do side

152
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,560
things instead if you really want to

153
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,280
show up your products for example we do

154
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,598
potato chips so our bag and if any of

155
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,638
you guys want to look at our products if

156
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,959
you haven't seen them it's um like on

157
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,199
Instagram it's yummy karma.com or yummy

158
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:21,560
Karma

159
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,439
yummi wasn't the most clever thing to do

160
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,038
at the time um but you'll see that we it

161
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,038
is it's appealing but it is not child

162
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:32,240
friendly we make sure it's child

163
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:34,759
resistant I think I went off of what I

164
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,840
was going to say though well we just

165
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,199
became one of the most compliant edible

166
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,478
companies in the state it and that has

167
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,960
kind of led to Media attention so now

168
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,279
yummy Karma you're the most compant

169
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,279
edible company in the state with your

170
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,159
packaging how does it feel that has

171
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,719
gotten us so many collectives to call us

172
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,080
and say I want to carry your product

173
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,599
because responsible so it is a big

174
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,719
investment but it pays off and you don't

175
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,839
want to think about what you can today

176
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,879
you want to think about what you can

177
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,239
sell for 5 or 10 years or if you want to

178
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,479
sell your company someday what what can

179
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,720
you do to set yourself up for that and

180
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,598
so we are thinking of ourselves as down

181
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,800
the line we're not looking at today and

182
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:20,159
I think that that is what this set

183
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,478
packaging is not cheap so when you do it

184
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,759
you want to make sure that you're doing

185
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:26,918
it for the long term exactly and when it

186
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,759
comes back to the CL compliance issue we

187
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:29,959
were fortunate enough to go back to

188
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,800
Colorado

189
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,680
um if you get the chance it's an amazing

190
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,000
opportunity to see how the industry is

191
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,759
unfolding there um we made friends and

192
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,038
had mentors I don't know if you've ever

193
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,400
heard of Love's oven but they were the

194
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,800
second uh edible manufacturing company

195
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,918
to get their license in Colorado and

196
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,639
they gave us a tour and they were very

197
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,478
nice um shared a lot of information and

198
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,439
the one thing they kept saying was over

199
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:57,359
compliance over compliance over

200
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,639
compliance over compliance because like

201
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,960
Tracy said people the officials the city

202
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,680
everybody that's trying to figure this

203
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,680
out is going to look towards the good

204
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,280
players they're going to want to work

205
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,800
with the people setting the right

206
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,679
example yeah and let me tell you that

207
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,478
you guys are probably the first meeting

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,720
we went to we heard someone stand up and

209
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,680
say I have 10 lawyers and I didn't

210
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,000
believe it but they really do and I

211
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,240
don't we looked in we like we have like

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,120
$5 in our bank account so how are we

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,038
going to manage that but I'll tell you

214
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,879
what it doesn't cost a lot you can go

215
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,000
online go to San Francisco or or any

216
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,959
Collective that you strive to be in or

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,879
if you're a grower you know anyone that

218
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,639
you respect in the industry you can even

219
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,439
look on the County's website up north

220
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:42,838
and they literally will tell you say

221
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,440
this this this this berley Patients

222
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,920
Group is a good one they literally have

223
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,880
like 20 pages of what you have to do in

224
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,360
order to get into their colle nothing

225
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,559
against the lawyers Lisa I don't want to

226
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,839
put it but it's a good starting ground

227
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,919
so if you can follow those guidelines

228
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,560
and then if you're already at that point

229
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,519
and then give it to a lawyer to look

230
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,199
over that saves you a lot of money right

231
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,679
and the compliance actually like we said

232
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,040
goes back to targeting women targeting

233
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,319
women who have children in the house not

234
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,159
having something that is appealing to

235
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,680
children and our bags are now child

236
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,919
resistant as well so and we have I mean

237
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,639
there's other brands that we know like

238
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,519
um Mary Jane I always get it wrong which

239
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,958
one miss Mar the Miss Mary Jan too

240
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,360
many um you know they've switched over

241
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,759
too so there's a lot of us that are

242
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
trying to be the good players in the

243
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,958
industry and that's what we need today I

244
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,399
was reading up on weed week and in

245
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:38,879
Colorado there's a backlash right now um

246
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,159
70% of the cities have banned commercial

247
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,958
uh cannabis so you'll hear a lot in

248
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,278
California oh the vote's going to happen

249
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,518
we're going to be good it's going to be

250
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,399
legal it's going to be fine that's not

251
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,879
necessarily the case right now

252
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,919
everybody's watching and anybody who

253
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,240
messes up could affect all of us so we

254
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:59,799
need to make sure that we're all in this

255
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,560
together to create a safe in industry

256
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,120
you know so um that's the great thing

257
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,000
about our industry everyone's so

258
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,560
friendly you guys are our competitors

259
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,720
but we don't look at you like that we

260
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,199
all look at each other as friends and

261
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,480
what can I do to help you we talked

262
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,200
about going to Love's oven in Colorado

263
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,600
if you call any company I guarantee you

264
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,360
they will give you a tour of their

265
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,159
facility they will give you advice in

266
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,639
the lease they will help you they'll

267
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:24,000
point it's like oh yeah I met this

268
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,159
person and I think that they can help

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,278
you we're all trying to we're we are all

270
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,439
on in the ground floor we all can can

271
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:35,759
move up together and that's why you guys

272
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:39,040
are here right yes so um I think that

273
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,480
kind of leads us to branding and

274
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,319
marketing where we might get a little

275
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,440
harsh um no if you'll notice uh our

276
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,399
products when you were to see them for

277
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,480
instance like in an Instagram post

278
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,879
they're very it's it's obvious what it

279
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,519
is we have big lettering it's easy to

280
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:58,039
read everything is laid out I can't tell

281
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,440
you how many times when I'm looking

282
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,078
through every morning cuz I'm always

283
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
checking to see who's new and who's out

284
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,439
there I can't tell what it is and it

285
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,519
drives me crazy so first and foremost

286
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,560
remember when a patient walks into a

287
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,560
collective and they're looking and they

288
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:14,559
have all of these Brands they could pick

289
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:16,119
from you want to not only stand out but

290
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,799
you want to make sure that your product

291
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,278
is obvious because a lot of people are

292
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,679
getting really into the look of it and

293
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:24,559
um and when you can't put a picture of

294
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,000
it cuz we would love to put a we

295
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,879
actually had pictures on our bags

296
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,320
originally and those and they were

297
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,958
no and they weren't they weren't even

298
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,240
pictures of food for instance we do a

299
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:38,919
sour cream and onion chip we had a

300
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,879
picture of an onion like a drawing can't

301
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,479
do that so you can do that right now and

302
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,078
not in San Francisco or Berkeley though

303
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,720
but leading up to 2018 you know we're

304
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:50,719
encouraging other people we see people

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,360
come out with this awesome packaging and

306
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,120
you can tell they spent a lot of money

307
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,120
it's a big portion of your budget trust

308
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,078
me and you don't want to get stuck with

309
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,600
it make sure down the road and if you

310
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:05,078
look at your paging it's great if it

311
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,120
looks great you're just looking at it

312
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:10,199
but picture how it's going to look when

313
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,120
you're in a sea of 500 products how is

314
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,560
it going to sit on the Shelf is it going

315
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,360
to sit upright or is it going to lay

316
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,078
down like our chips for example we had

317
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,919
to toy around with are we going to punch

318
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:22,239
holes in each one and have them how are

319
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,958
patients right now you care about how

320
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,879
patients are going to look at your

321
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,719
product and how it's going to stand out

322
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,958
without being child friendly and there's

323
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,079
there's a fine line be difficult so a

324
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:35,119
little story on one of our mistakes that

325
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:37,039
we did um so I always think it's good to

326
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,440
share something so that you guys don't

327
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,838
do it um when we started off yummy Karma

328
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,360
we actually had a different logo it was

329
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:49,240
a Buddha real original um we liked it

330
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,079
I'm half Japanese I was like this isn't

331
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,320
offensive well if you're trying to grow

332
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:55,399
a national brand or even go

333
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,000
International it's it could be so the

334
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,879
other thing was is it just didn't stand

335
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,399
out there was a lot of people doing a

336
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,919
Buddha um luckily we didn't have a

337
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:07,480
generic name yummy karma for some reason

338
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,399
people just tend to remember um but we

339
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,560
invested a lot into it we didn't really

340
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,799
you know we bought the trade show stuff

341
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,879
we bought shirts stickers everything

342
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:19,359
everything

343
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,320
wewh yeah and then we went to a show and

344
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,560
we were like oh we're not the only ones

345
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,040
there's a Buddha no there are all buddas

346
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:30,439
and it's difficult my advice to you guys

347
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,879
is you can get attached to anything

348
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,399
anything you make any logo anything you

349
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,399
have to be open to hearing what the

350
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,159
market tells you we have ditched so many

351
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:42,559
products that we were like this is the

352
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:45,480
next best thing and now it's don't fall

353
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,479
in love with your product um no you can

354
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,800
after it makes you a lot of money but

355
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,920
until then it's it's smart to listen to

356
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,159
the feedback don't get defensive about

357
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,240
things I mean people are they're being

358
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:01,559
brutally honest but that's kind of what

359
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:05,278
you want so um it was painful to throw

360
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:07,399
it all away things that we had to ditch

361
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,519
too yeah and you have to remember we got

362
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,600
some of this advice that you are only as

363
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,720
strong as your weakest product so even

364
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,120
if all of your other products are flying

365
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
off the shelves and you have these

366
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,879
strains that are doing really well the

367
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,480
buyers of the clubs are going to

368
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:23,000
remember the weakest one cuz it's going

369
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,920
to be sitting there and they're not

370
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,240
going to reorder until that's gone so

371
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,559
that was something that you have to

372
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,320
remember you made love product B love it

373
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:36,559
if it's not moving move on kill it um I

374
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,720
think the final thing which this is the

375
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:42,198
side effect bring my

376
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,278
job well one one other thing we wanted

377
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:46,439
to talk about is when it comes to

378
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,278
branding you have to know who you are

379
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,199
better than anyone else out there you

380
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:52,000
need an elevator pitch and you've heard

381
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:54,278
that with TV and everything but you

382
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,278
really do need to be able to if you have

383
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,600
someone in an elevator tell them what

384
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,679
your brand is right away have ra have a

385
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,759
one liner like we are a California

386
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,799
Lifestyle brand of cannabis that targets

387
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,919
women that is our brand we're also for

388
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,439
the generation that can up so we have

389
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:13,639
kind of a younger audience and so we're

390
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,399
able to tell people exactly what we are

391
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,198
we know who we are and that makes it

392
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,198
easier when we work with anybody for

393
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:23,559
example we have a Distribution Company

394
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:25,719
call if you're here we love you yeah all

395
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:29,439
right they're the best that could be

396
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,680
biased yes bied I think think the only

397
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,279
other thing that I was going to bring I

398
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,638
can't remember what the other thing was

399
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,799
well you were going to say that if you

400
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,079
have Kaa in your name oh yeah but

401
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,278
there's people in here that do so unless

402
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:42,879
you're

403
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:45,360
Tracy then you're okay unless you're

404
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,240
Tracy if you want to have a commercial

405
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,919
brand that really makes it think about

406
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,318
what's going to work at Trader Joe's so

407
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,958
if you have beer you don't call it beer

408
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:57,000
so if you have a cannabis product don't

409
00:15:53,958 --> 00:16:00,239
call it can of something you can right

410
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,360
now but in a few years it's going to not

411
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,399
be a brand that maybe stands out you

412
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,879
reminded me all right before I forget um

413
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,198
yeah think about how you if you're

414
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,519
starting a business and I know this

415
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:12,278
doesn't speak to everyone because not

416
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,159
everyone's doing kind of what we do but

417
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:16,078
think about where you're trying to head

418
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,559
in the next year two years 3 years down

419
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,519
the road are you trying to create a

420
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,198
boutique type edible where you're going

421
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,720
to make something fresh every day and

422
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,399
you're going to deliver it to the local

423
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,000
collectives and you're just going to

424
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,240
build a local presence an example would

425
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,720
be like uh Pete treats which is actually

426
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
up North so I don't know if any of you

427
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,519
know who that is but um they heavily

428
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,000
blanketed the Santa Cruz area you can't

429
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,839
go anywhere without anybody knowing

430
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,559
about Pet's trades and they were able to

431
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,240
do that because you know they can

432
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,638
service that small area when you're

433
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,000
trying to service the whole state think

434
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,639
shelf life and think you know will it

435
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,360
melt you know we're in the Central

436
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
Valley where it's 100° thank goodness we

437
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,600
don't do chocolate it would not be

438
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,959
successful we try yeah but think about

439
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,360
all these things because you'll think

440
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,359
you have this great idea but if you

441
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,078
don't walk it through the whole way from

442
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,078
sourcing what you need and you know

443
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,159
looking at food prices all the way

444
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:12,959
through the distribution channels to the

445
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,439
actual Collective how like you said

446
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,199
earlier how is it going to be packaged

447
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,439
is it going to melt can it get squished

448
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,959
does it have to be chilled the whole

449
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,120
time um if you want to build an Empire

450
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,160
you have to make sure you can actually

451
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,239
service all over the state over the

452
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,279
country exactly we're all rooing for

453
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,720
that and I think last thing is we want

454
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:36,000
everyone to have fun this is you have to

455
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,919
approach every day because it is always

456
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
changing like Tracy said you have to

457
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
come in with a smile you have to be

458
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,798
passionate about what you do and you

459
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,840
have to come out to events like this and

460
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:47,079
you guys already made that amazing First

461
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,038
Step so round of applause for all of you

462
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:52,879
guys absolutely and we love questions

463
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:52,879
questions all

464
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:01,240
right when you guys decide to use a

465
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,479
strain or or flour or concentrate to

466
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,038
make your

467
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,440
Edibles how do you research that to know

468
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:12,599
that you're getting the topest quality

469
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,480
that you can can or do you grow your own

470
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:17,959
no we don't grow our own we definitely

471
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,599
Source it um it depends on what we're

472
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,240
doing so for example we

473
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,119
actually don't Focus so much and some

474
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,480
people in the room are going to

475
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,759
completely disagree with this but we

476
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:32,200
don't Focus so much on whether it's c or

477
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:34,400
an Inda um mostly because when we

478
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,919
process it and apply it to like the

479
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,038
chips or anything we lose the Turin and

480
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:41,120
so you're kind of losing a lot of what

481
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,519
determines it so um we actually just

482
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,918
work with a hybrid for that and the way

483
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,960
we actually deal with the indicus dativa

484
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,559
thing is we have a line of tinctures for

485
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,240
example um if you're most of you I'm

486
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:55,678
sure are familiar it's a liquid form of

487
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,480
cannabis so we've developed sleep

488
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,280
tincture which is called driftway and

489
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,240
what we do instead is we focus on what

490
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,079
we combine it with so this one was

491
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,038
actually developed from my mother she

492
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,839
was on prescription sleep pills for a

493
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,640
long time and um my little sister's in

494
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,119
the room she can attest to this it's

495
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,200
scary um when someone's taking sleep

496
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,879
pills they are incoherent sometimes

497
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,159
should we appreciate that um what we did

498
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,280
is we combined we worked with an

499
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:25,840
herbalist and we combined it with

500
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:28,759
chamomile lavender melatonin um and

501
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,359
that's what we actually use to Market

502
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,440
to get the effects of what some people

503
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:38,079
would want into come for um same thing

504
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:40,279
for our our lifted tincture we we Market

505
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,279
that as more of a daytime one so the

506
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:45,798
rest of the people on the Shelf all say

507
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:48,000
sativa tincture ours doesn't but what we

508
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:50,038
do instead is we add natural caffeine

509
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,480
and b12

510
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:57,200
um jury's still out on it

511
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,558
but oh yeah there's th yeah we worked

512
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,200
with an herbalist to enhance the THC or

513
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,359
CBD so we have seven different teamates

514
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,840
four contain CBD and three are solely

515
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:12,158
THC yeah okay so um we did a line of

516
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:14,439
Edibles early on and we did it based on

517
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,600
what I was using for my medication and

518
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,080
it was really a lowd dose edible what

519
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,399
was interesting is when we went to

520
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,279
dispensaries a lot of them were like

521
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,440
you'll never sell this because it's not

522
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,359
strong enough yes and we kind of Ste to

523
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,798
our game went said oh you got to make it

524
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,038
stronger make it stronger but we just

525
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,038
felt that not everybody wants to get

526
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:34,960
whacked out so we left it like that we

527
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,279
went to a conference about a year ago to

528
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,319
a bunch of attorneys pun Lisa but uh

529
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,240
they were talking about the edbl and

530
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,079
they came was an attorney for Dixie

531
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,120
Elixir okay and they were talking about

532
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:49,158
bosing yes I was learning if you're

533
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,759
going to say that word right and it's so

534
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,960
funny that it's come around to that that

535
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,158
so many people don't know you know this

536
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,079
w't take the edge off so how do you

537
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:00,960
address that that's actually interesting

538
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:04,000
because our chips um are considered low

539
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,079
in the industry they're only 50 Mig um

540
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,960
so compared to sometimes you see like a

541
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,839
th000 milligrams in a bar um that

542
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,600
actually also goes back to like a lot of

543
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:17,759
the people we target are not looking to

544
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:19,599
just pass out all day um so we consider

545
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,839
a lot of our products micro doing all of

546
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,599
our tines are labeled on the milliliter

547
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,000
so you can know exactly how much you're

548
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,599
getting per milliliter um we do go on

549
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,519
the low end but we've actually found

550
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:34,678
that the clubs love the micro doing um

551
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:37,158
Buds and Roses which we're in now Raves

552
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:39,600
about it and so you're seeing a lot of

553
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:42,000
professionals women elderly people who

554
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,719
are entering the market um and a lot of

555
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,079
people I'm sure most of you or some of

556
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,960
you have had the experience where you'll

557
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:50,519
never have an edible again you know it's

558
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,200
like uhuh I did that one time my sister

559
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:54,918
made brownies one time and I was like

560
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,519
I'll never do it and now I did but it is

561
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,120
it's a dosage thing I mean I can eat a

562
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,079
bag of our chips and I'm fine

563
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:05,519
I didn't today but um but yeah I'm

564
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,519
curious to know what dose were you doing

565
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,918
for yours I'm what most people would

566
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,960
call a lightweight so I for me to take

567
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,840
the edge off 5 Mig and then I can kind

568
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,798
of dose whatever through the day but

569
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:20,720
right I'm fully effective

570
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:22,599
and yeah I I think that you have hit the

571
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,558
market at the right time right now every

572
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:26,719
Collective we've gone into recently and

573
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,480
I think CX our Distribution Company can

574
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,159
probably tell you the same thing they've

575
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,360
told us that they're able to sell our

576
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,640
products better because they are micro

577
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,918
doed so and they're clearly labeled so

578
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,080
it's not necessarily if you you can have

579
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,720
1,000 milligrams in your package but you

580
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:45,359
need to let people know that there are

581
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,640
100 doses in there right so as long as

582
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:50,119
it's marked and they're able to you know

583
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,000
you can't have a square of chocolate

584
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,759
that has 500 milligram and they just

585
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,679
nibble on the corner none of us are

586
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,480
realistically going to do that I'll eat

587
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,880
the whole thing but um so you need to be

588
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,200
able to have it in a form like our

589
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,360
tinctures you can just easily Take 5 Mig

590
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,120
of our tincture so and our in our

591
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:09,479
package shows you how to do that so I

592
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,239
think that that's a key and that's and

593
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,200
that's and that's how Colorado is doing

594
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,319
it too so and that's what we looked at

595
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Colorado yeah because you're doing a

596
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,720
great job thank you oh thank you you too

597
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,159
did you explore independent sales teams

598
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,759
uh before going with the Distribution

599
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:26,799
Company or what was the thought process

600
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:29,640
behind hiring a Distribution Company

601
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,240
versus anything else um well we're

602
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,640
really handson to the point where we

603
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,159
don't think anyone can do it as good as

604
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,480
we can so that was really hard um but we

605
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,559
looked at sales teams

606
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,400
and actually c m is going to become like

607
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:45,960
a pitch for them um they do sales and

608
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,798
distribution that's why it's such a

609
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,400
beautiful pairing um so they do it all

610
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:53,359
literally they come they pick it up we

611
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,440
get to focus on what we do best which I

612
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,278
highly recommend we only focus on the

613
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,840
product and making it perfect and we let

614
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,880
other people handle the sales the

615
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,678
distribution now that doesn't say you

616
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,760
know we're backing them up on stuff we

617
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,120
still do a lot of promotions and certain

618
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:11,879
things like that um to supplement but I

619
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,678
would definitely find a good partner in

620
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,600
the industry who's doing what they do

621
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,080
best because we ran the numbers on doing

622
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,558
our own celles team and distribution and

623
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,678
all that and it honestly didn't make

624
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,918
sense and you're not going to be able to

625
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:28,000
in 2018 you're going to have to go

626
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,038
through a distributor because um if it's

627
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,038
going to be required so they can cross

628
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:33,759
check and they can test your product

629
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,798
before it gets on the Shelf so that's

630
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,000
also a good thing to know I wouldn't

631
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:41,000
invest in a sales team right

632
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,640
now what tpes are in your various

633
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,200
products I'm interested in the Sleep

634
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,919
product uh what turp that you have

635
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,519
decided to include for that's a

636
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:55,080
very or your Inda right which I kind of

637
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:58,200
touched on earlier because our process

638
00:24:55,079 --> 00:25:01,119
is proprietary that too too but it's

639
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,159
also heated so um we're working with

640
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,119
along with other edal companies who are

641
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:06,960
researching actually extracting the

642
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,479
interes before and then adding them back

643
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,319
in but right now that hasn't been yes

644
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:16,000
yeah so that right now is unfortunately

645
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,599
not really yeah

646
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,798
sorry hi I have a question about

647
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:23,639
distribution I work for a Distribution

648
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,720
Company and I find that a lot of people

649
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,320
are really scared of me when I talk to

650
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,278
them about what I do or hesit to get

651
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:34,798
involved and you as a vendor how do you

652
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,240
how did you reconcile that from yourself

653
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,798
so who scar I'm saying talking to

654
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,399
vendors and stuff that come down to

655
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,599
being uneducated well the the

656
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:47,439
Distribution Company probably doesn't

657
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,480
like me that much because I'm on the

658
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,000
phone with them all the time um and

659
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,240
that's that's another thing but um a

660
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,839
relationship you have to be able to

661
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,919
build a relationship and that's just

662
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,599
like here let me tell you a quick story

663
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,960
goes to this uh we went to a women grow

664
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:06,199
event and we met a woman who owns three

665
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,120
very high-profile collectives up north

666
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,759
and we watched every single one walk up

667
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:11,439
to where and go you have to carry our

668
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,240
products you have to carry our products

669
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,278
we walked up and we said Hi how are you

670
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,880
you want to have a drink yeah and we did

671
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:20,398
that for a full year and we just got

672
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,520
into our we have good times yeah we have

673
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:24,439
fun that's for sure um so it's about

674
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:27,079
building relationships in this industry

675
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,880
you can't just walk in with your pitch

676
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:31,278
and I think that goes to a lot of things

677
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,240
but truly in this business everyone

678
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,759
thinks they're an expert on cannabis

679
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,798
right your next door neighbor your

680
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,440
cousin oh you're in the industry oh let

681
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:43,639
me tell you about this you know so and

682
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,960
they may be but you need to walk in and

683
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,120
have relationships so you know rather

684
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,360
than and and we just talked about this

685
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:52,000
we get a lot of emails from a lot of

686
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:55,519
distribution companies and a lot of

687
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,919
other vendors in their own right if they

688
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,918
started off with a pitch it goes to the

689
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,000
trashman because we really truly don't

690
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,720
have time to take pictures but if it

691
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,759
starts off and it says hey I read about

692
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,798
you in The Economist this month or I saw

693
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:11,839
you in High Times and wow that was so

694
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:13,679
great all all you have to do is do a

695
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,240
quick Google search find out what

696
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,278
they've just been in find out a little

697
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,399
bit about them give give us an

698
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:22,079
introductory line or two and then say

699
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,558
hey I'd love to take five minutes of

700
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,759
your time will you be at women grow La

701
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,038
this month that's a great way to do it

702
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,240
rather than saying hey can I schedule a

703
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,319
call with you I don't we really don't

704
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,278
have time for that we honestly work

705
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:38,278
around the clock so in order to do that

706
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:40,240
meet us at women grow pull us aside and

707
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:41,960
say hey I sent you an email you know it

708
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,319
takes about three times I think and

709
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,798
that's how we build all of our

710
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:47,798
relationships and that's how the

711
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,798
Distribution Company worked with us too

712
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:51,918
when I asked that question I actually

713
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:54,398
forgot about this fact but I definitely

714
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:59,519
emailed you guys oh did you start with

715
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:59,518
the pitch I bet you did I bet you did

716
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,519
well we'll give you a second chance I'll

717
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,439
take you out of my trash folder I'll

718
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,359
reread it

719
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,919
okay who

720
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:13,199
else hi there um I'm wondering how you

721
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,600
advertise and Market I know you're

722
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,558
marketing but how do you do that given

723
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,519
the

724
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:24,240
constrictions of this whole industry and

725
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:27,240
then also like are you finding that

726
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,919
you're kind of limited by using things

727
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:33,599
like maps and you know there's only

728
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:37,960
minimal um access for people my answer

729
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:41,359
is easy it's get Crea so we don't look

730
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,600
at the restrictions we've been in for

731
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,479
the economist we've been in all of the

732
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,038
major players we've been on all sorts of

733
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,720
media stations because we don't view

734
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:53,319
oursel as a cannabis company we view

735
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,079
oursel as a company and that's what

736
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:58,599
we're all trying to do here we're trying

737
00:28:55,079 --> 00:29:00,639
to just be normal so we sponsor things

738
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,439
for example we're sponsoring the women

739
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,840
grow retreat in Lake Tahoe how many of

740
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,640
you guys are going next month oh no one

741
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,119
oh no you guys need to go that that

742
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,799
event will get you business if you're

743
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:16,319
looking for vendors go AB um but so we

744
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:19,079
basically I write news releases and I

745
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:23,119
don't send them to weed maps and leely I

746
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:26,519
send them to Fox News and CNN and MSNBC

747
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:28,759
and so that's how we've been successful

748
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,960
we send stuff of orbs we send stuff to

749
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:32,558
The Economist and then they start

750
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,440
writing about you and the other people

751
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,000
pick up we do advertise an industry

752
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,038
magazines which has been great I don't

753
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,720
know if Farley from mg magazine is here

754
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:44,720
um he was one of the first people that

755
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,480
we advertised with and he really opened

756
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,240
yeah he opened the door and introduced

757
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,558
us to a lot of people so we get creative

758
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,038
I was going to say yeah cuz we

759
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:55,359
originally started going to the shows um

760
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,879
we did like haveon and chalis then we

761
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,759
realized we didn't why are we here

762
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,159
there's nobody that we're targeting um

763
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,640
there's a few but not that many but when

764
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,640
it comes down to advertising you've got

765
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,240
to get like she said be creative whether

766
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,440
it's your social media or whatever but

767
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,000
what we really realized was the smartest

768
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,120
thing sorry the smartest thing to do was

769
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,398
to actually invest into the people

770
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:19,798
behind the counter of the collective

771
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:23,079
because it that's how many times you

772
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,759
walk in and you're like I don't know

773
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:26,398
what I want what what's good and they're

774
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:29,640
like this is good all right I'll take

775
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,839
that um so what we do is we created um

776
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,880
and I'm going to call them BT tender

777
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,199
buckets because that's what they're

778
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,880
called so when we get into a new

779
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,519
Collective we give all of their Bud

780
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,399
tenders samples of our products we come

781
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,480
in we'll buy them lunch we entertain

782
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:47,319
them they love us and when people love

783
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,599
you they want to help you for free so um

784
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:51,558
we realize that investing into the

785
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,119
people who are actually going to be

786
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:56,240
talking to your customer was really

787
00:30:54,119 --> 00:31:00,759
really smart

788
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,240
yeah think so hi is there an average

789
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:06,599
industry markup right now for between

790
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:10,079
your price and the price this charging

791
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:13,199
yes it seems like they always double it

792
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:16,158
so um we were told that you're supposed

793
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,519
to do 2.3% markup if you're a collective

794
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,399
but I'm thinking that's by a city um

795
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,759
typically anything that you sell it for

796
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:26,000
wholesale they double the price um you

797
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:29,398
can have some control depending on per

798
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,638
se what the product is um whether it's

799
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:36,079
like really specialty you know celebrity

800
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:38,519
selling it or that type of thing but um

801
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,278
and milligrams really controls the price

802
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,759
so whenever you're making something just

803
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:45,000
remember that people tend to look at the

804
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:49,359
average industry right now is about a

805
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,720
dollar every 10 milligram yes so for

806
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,638
example our chips go for $5 typically um

807
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,000
which is actually a great price point

808
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:57,918
because it's kind of like a grab and go

809
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,440
thing so

810
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,639
that does play into whether or not like

811
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,399
what you can create so for example we've

812
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:07,719
got a friend that does um dark chocolate

813
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:10,359
and it's very expensive so she has a

814
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,120
very hard time doing the micro doing

815
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:16,240
just because her price point is already

816
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:19,038
so high so that's good question question

817
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,638
how did you guys capitalize all this

818
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:25,278
what how did you capitalize all

819
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:28,000
this where'd you get your money oh okay

820
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:30,038
um friends and family

821
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,200
that's typically the best way to go

822
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:32,200
right

823
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,278
now I have two questions um the labs you

824
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,159
test your your shape or your flowers

825
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,759
from where is that and how much did your

826
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:47,840
certified kitchen cost you to pick out

827
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:49,759
of we have multiple Labs we don't work

828
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,558
with just one because they tend to have

829
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,919
varying results um that's actually

830
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:56,480
something that's been difficult in our

831
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:58,559
industry with um Edibles um American

832
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,240
first Americans for safe access I think

833
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,678
recently did a lot of research on that

834
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,679
and found that um a lot of the machines

835
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,200
that they use for testing was never

836
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,200
really me to be tested with like cookie

837
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,798
matter or potato chip matter in it so it

838
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,360
definitely skews the results obviously

839
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:21,398
we test all of our base material um we

840
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:23,719
use SE Labs um SD Farms we've

841
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:27,918
used I'm not thinking of the one up

842
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,880
north steill Steep Hill yes um so we

843
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,080
tend to work with multiple and we cross

844
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,320
check them because it just seems like

845
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:36,638
the best thing to do right now your

846
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:39,918
certified kitchen how much do that cost

847
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:42,839
you to put out oh

848
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,679
Welling no certified kitchen I mean the

849
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,119
actual space came empty so that was

850
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,880
cheap but um putting it all in you could

851
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,759
spend anywhere from 80 to $200,000

852
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,639
building out I would say depends on your

853
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,599
Machinery depends on what you need and

854
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:57,439
how automated You Are we almost bought a

855
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,278
chip bagging machine for qu million

856
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,159
dollars thank God we didn't do that

857
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:04,519
because it was really not that great

858
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,799
when we saw it I mean really people

859
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,119
catch things a lot more than automation

860
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:09,759
we were like yeah we'll just get this

861
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,800
machine and we'll just let it run all

862
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,879
day that's not the case it still took

863
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,440
just as many people to run the machine

864
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:18,118
as it did to do something that was more

865
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,679
rudimentary for packaging so um don't

866
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,838
get sold by

867
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,559
salespeople on on their shiny Machinery

868
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,000
it's very tempting you're like super

869
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,358
excited cuz you're putting out like

870
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,199
thousands and thousands of bags a day uh

871
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,799
go to the like actual facilities we've

872
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,358
taken tours of manufacturing companies

873
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,240
we've seen it all run and now we know

874
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:42,598
exactly like what pieces to get because

875
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,719
it's costly we did buy one piece of

876
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:49,200
machinery and it doesn't work and it was

877
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:52,799
very expensive so I was going to say

878
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:55,719
also we hired a former FDA inspector to

879
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,680
come through because they won't know

880
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:59,799
current FDA inp ector is going to come

881
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,039
through a cannabis and do this so we

882
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,200
hired someone to come through set it all

883
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:08,920
up for us and we paid him so that once

884
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:11,279
we are able to run in a legal manner or

885
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,599
at least in a way that we're same with

886
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,880
manufacturing right same with

887
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:17,000
manufacturing we hired people who worked

888
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,240
at huge plants to come through and say

889
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,599
this is what you can do and this is what

890
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:23,439
you can't do because you know we didn't

891
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:26,280
want to wear a hair inet but we do think

892
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,639
about it we're doing food and cannabis

893
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,680
it's like the worst idea ever it's the

894
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,519
best idea but it's like the worst cuz

895
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:33,679
you're dealing with the health

896
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,838
department food County all that and

897
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,960
you're trying to deal with a new like

898
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,199
the compliance issues of cannabis

899
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:44,320
anybody in the ancillary business out

900
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:46,199
here smart very smart yeah

901
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,000
need okay I know we're not supposed to

902
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,000
do anymore but

903
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,960
okay that

904
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,280
come

905
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,400
okay lawyers yeah we we do read

906
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,400
everything they send us and like Tracy

907
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,559
said it's constantly changing so it's

908
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,960
scary when you're making decisions about

909
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,239
where to even get your permit or certain

910
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,079
things cuz they can literally pull the

911
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,318
rug out from under you um we know

912
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,680
someone who I think might be in the room

913
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:22,679
but he had a got the license in

914
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:26,799
Washington and was totally ready to go

915
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:28,838
and then his County banned it so um

916
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,400
basically the you it's it's a lot of

917
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:34,639
risk but it's high risk High reward so I

918
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,039
mean just trying to stay on top of

919
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:37,799
everything the best thing you could do

920
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:40,000
really is just get good legal advice I

921
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,160
would say and we've got a lot of good

922
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,719
lawyers if you need some I think her

923
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,639
question was specifically about the

924
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:48,679
adult use initiative that's coming up in

925
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,799
November how would that affect you well

926
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:53,279
by being one of the more compliant or

927
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,440
most compliant companies now in the

928
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,119
medical we're looking at what Colorado

929
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,920
did which is they only gave licenses to

930
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,640
people who were doing recreational and

931
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,358
had that license or excuse me medical

932
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:06,078
and had that license before they could

933
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,358
get recreational um so the main focus

934
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,240
right now and if I'm hopefully answering

935
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:13,078
this right um if you want to get in the

936
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:15,919
recreational game make sure that you're

937
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,720
around in 2018 with the medicinal game

938
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,318
because that's who's going to get their

939
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:21,959
license

940
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:24,599
first excellent all right well let's

941
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,599
give the two of

942
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,599
these

943
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,760
oh
