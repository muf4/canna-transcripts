1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,839
[Music]

2
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,759
let's go ahead and go to uh the CHP and

3
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,640
then we'll open it up for questions

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,199
morning thank you Mr chair uh Madam

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,920
chair Mr chair and members uh I'm rich

6
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,840
Desmond I'm the legislative director for

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,240
the California Highway Patrol and I'm

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,000
appearing today on behalf of

9
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,960
commissioner Joe far who wanted me to

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,960
send his regrets he really wanted to be

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,520
here to be a part of this important

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,399
discussion this is a obviously an issue

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,160
that has a uh large impact on law

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,640
enforcement in the state of California

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,919
with the anticipated increased use of uh

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,719
of marijuana and increased incidences of

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,039
impaired driving in the state of

18
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,439
California a lot of the law enforcement

19
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,480
impact will uh affect locals in their

20
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,280
local communities and certainly I'll be

21
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,640
deferring to to them to express their

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,518
concerns but on Statewide level from the

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,000
California highway patrols pers

24
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:07,478
perspective an agency that makes 2

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,879
million enforcement contacts a year uh

26
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:12,118
it will have some real big challenges

27
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,118
for us in the areas of Transportation of

28
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:16,599
marijuana marijuana products and

29
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:19,040
certainly in the area of impair driving

30
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,078
that Mr suar touched on briefly and I'll

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,680
I'll certainly go into a little more

32
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,559
detail about it with respect to the

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,200
transportation issues our experience

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,359
with the transportation of medicinal

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,040
marijuana has revealed that there's a a

36
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,680
lot of confusion in in the law

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,920
enforcement area about who can lawfully

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,360
transport it how much can lawfully be

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,000
transported um you combine this with as

40
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:43,078
as Mr chair you referenced a a patchwork

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,399
of local regulations and it certainly

42
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,158
makes it confusing for the officer on

43
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,040
the side of the road to make it a

44
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,200
determination when and where that

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,200
transportation is being conducted uh uh

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,439
lawfully the good news is that we have a

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,560
very productive relationship with uh uh

48
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,279
the Department of Consumer Affairs the

49
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,719
department of technology and all the

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,399
other licens seeing authorities

51
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,959
identified both in the MC or the

52
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,318
medicinal marijuana legislation and prop

53
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,239
64 um and and we've been involved

54
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,839
meeting with them and helping ensure

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,519
that a a regulatory framework that is

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,360
put in place has clear guidance for law

57
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,759
enforcement agencies on the front lines

58
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,560
for instance one of the areas that we've

59
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,919
been where we've been talking to them is

60
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,920
in the development of a track and Trace

61
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,759
system um you can imagine the benefits

62
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,799
of a of a system for law enforcement if

63
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,679
I I pull someone over or perhaps uh uh

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,160
encounter somebody at a collision scene

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,319
who is transporting marijuana the

66
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,000
officer I I I need to be able to verify

67
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,238
that that marijuana is coming from a

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,280
licensed facility it's going to a

69
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,280
licensed facility wherever it is in the

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,800
distribution chain a cultivator a

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
distributor a processor um and also to

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,480
make sure the amount being processed or

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,000
being transported is is within the

74
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,000
licensing restrictions as part of these

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,120
discussions on about a track and Trace

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
system we've been uh having regular

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,319
conversations about what law enforcement

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,039
would need to see on say a manifest

79
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,000
whether that's a paper manifest or an

80
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,798
electronic manifest as part of a

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,158
database we were track into um how it

82
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,560
would need to be packaged and

83
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,000
appropriately labeled for law

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,400
enforcement to be able to read and be

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,598
able to decipher um and and these are

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,120
these are some some issues that are

87
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,039
going to be crucial for us as we move

88
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,680
forward and see more marijuana out on

89
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,560
the uh out on the roadways that we

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,760
Patrol the other really large issue that

91
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,799
obviously we anticipate with the CHP is

92
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,039
the increase in impaired driving um I I

93
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,760
believe the Department of Public Health

94
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,400
is going to address some of the science

95
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,079
behind marijuana but from from our

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,599
perspective it's uh it's a very

97
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,280
difficult landscape because marijuana is

98
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:47,119
infinitely more complex than alcohol uh

99
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,400
people want to make the the easy

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,640
comparison with alcohol hey we we do it

101
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,158
this way for alcohol with law

102
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,559
enforcement why can't we do it similarly

103
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,560
for marijuana well marijuana it's very

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,759
difficult to correlate levels with

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,560
impairment as you know it's very very

106
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,679
difficult to measure for an officer on

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,759
the side of the road these are some of

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,959
the inherent challenges uh that we have

109
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,759
and you combine some of these challenges

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,920
with now uh diverse products we're

111
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,199
seeing out there on the roadways of all

112
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,199
shapes and sizes of all levels of

113
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,000
potency that we're experiencing and you

114
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,280
can imagine some of our challenges with

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
detecting apprehending and of course

116
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,159
Prosecuting uh uh marijuana impaired

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,439
drivers now propis in 64 does have some

118
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,840
specifics relating to the CHP and that's

119
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,120
that's good news I mean it provides uh 3

120
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,799
million a year for 5 years for the the

121
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,879
highway patrol to oversee uh research

122
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,280
what we're hoping to do is is piggyback

123
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,918
on some of the research that's already

124
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,918
being overseen by the Department of

125
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,399
Consumer Affairs following some of the

126
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:49,639
medicinal recal medicinal uh marijuana

127
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,679
legislation to help uh develop better

128
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,478
field sobriety tests for law enforcement

129
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,879
officers to use to detect a marijuana

130
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,000
impair drivers um we hope to be able to

131
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,319
use some of this research funds to help

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,199
identify technology that help officers

133
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,240
on the side of the road uh commissioner

134
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,960
phoh will actually be going to

135
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,960
University of California San Diego with

136
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:10,359
their their medical medical cannabis

137
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,000
Research Center along with uh uh Miss

138
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Ajax from the Bureau of marijuana

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,839
control and uh Chris Murphy from the

140
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,919
national highway traffic safety

141
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,918
administration and uh and the office of

142
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,359
traffic safety to to go talk with those

143
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,240
researchers about the research they're

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,479
currently doing to improve field

145
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,519
sobriety testing and and what additional

146
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:30,439
research they may be able to accomplish

147
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,000
as part of the proposition 64 funding

148
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,639
the other thing that prop 64 does

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,720
specifically with the with the highway

150
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,478
patrol is it provides a portion of the

151
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,639
tax revenue for DUI DUI related training

152
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,918
for not only CHP officers but also our

153
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,079
Allied agency partners uh um grants to

154
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,318
local governments uh for prevention

155
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,318
education enforcement and

156
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,280
equipment I want to just very briefly

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,918
touch on a few of the things that the

158
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,799
the Califoria hway Patrol is already

159
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,918
doing in anticipation of uh increased

160
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,360
marijuana use and and because we we know

161
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,719
there is some delay with the funding

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,120
from proposition 64 we're restructuring

163
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,160
things administratively within our

164
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,800
department to refocus rep prioritize on

165
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,319
impaired driver training and education

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,680
we are are changing some of our internal

167
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,919
uh data collection uh methods for

168
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,879
Collision reporting and arrest reporting

169
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,120
to more accurately capture drug impaired

170
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,159
driving information um we are the

171
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,120
Statewide drug recognition expert

172
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,039
coordinator uh in conjunction with uh OT

173
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,240
the office of traffic safety and Nitsa

174
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,879
we hope to train 400 additional drug

175
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,199
recognition experts within this next

176
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,560
year we are actually training every one

177
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,400
of our officers and sergeants in

178
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,038
advanced uh recogn roadside impairment

179
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,839
driver education uh so our officers line

180
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,719
level officers will have a much better

181
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,719
understanding of the impacts of drug use

182
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,639
specifically marijuana use and how it

183
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,360
impacts driver

184
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,400
impairment um we are also participating

185
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,639
in a number of of different task forces

186
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,638
with the office of traffic safety with

187
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,439
Department of Motor Vehicles our Allied

188
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,800
agency partners uh Nitsa crime Labs

189
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,839
prosecutors on identifying some some

190
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,960
best practices best approaches to deal

191
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,318
with this problem from the law

192
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,000
enforcement

193
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,240
perspective and with that that's uh the

194
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,360
the the extent of my prepared remarks

195
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm happy to answer any questions you

196
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,960
may have thank you uh Mr Desmond

197
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,399
appreciate that and um I know there's a

198
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,279
lot of questions I know I get questions

199
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,079
back in the district especially relating

200
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,119
to CHP you've touched on some of those

201
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:34,639
um obviously the

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,639
AMU allows up to $3 million to be spent

203
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,560
and you were talking about some of the

204
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,120
like filled sobriety tests and whatnot

205
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,280
and some of the research that DCA is

206
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,560
doing I've been uh talking to a number

207
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:47,519
of doctors and different agencies about

208
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,158
the research and it seems to

209
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:54,120
be not well coordinated I guess is a

210
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:57,560
good way so can you set shed some light

211
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,158
on just From chp's perspective do you

212
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,839
see this as like a breath izer like we

213
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:05,360
do for DUI or what type of tests are we

214
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,478
just still at the beginning phases and

215
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,400
don't know what that looks like yet or

216
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,240
do we have kind of some sense I think

217
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,519
it's it's more of the former I think we

218
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,879
don't there's a lot of new technology

219
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,240
out there and we don't necessarily know

220
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,960
what this new technology is capable of

221
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,960
and and how feasible or logistical it is

222
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,279
to use on the side of the road and I've

223
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,279
had multiple conversations with

224
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,318
commissioner pharoh and the

225
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,079
administration about using some of this

226
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,240
research money to to have an independent

227
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,199
vet some of these devices and actually

228
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,038
give law enforcement in California

229
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,839
information about if you're going to use

230
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:39,639
this device this is what it's going to

231
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,200
test this is what it's going to collect

232
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,319
you can have faith and confidence in

233
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,720
that when we deploy it out in the field

234
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,080
um and that's what we're hoping to get

235
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,440
out of some of the research that we will

236
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,879
be overseeing got it so given that um

237
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,080
you know marijuana use is probably been

238
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,399
occurring for some time now what are

239
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,040
some of the methods that CHP officers

240
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,799
are going through now you know whether

241
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,879
somebody was using it for medical or

242
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,639
something before the Au AUM was passed

243
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,159
so right now all of our officers are

244
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,759
trade trained at the Academy obviously

245
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,360
in in in alcohol and and Drug impairment

246
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,838
detection they're trained in in field

247
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,120
sobriety testing specifically

248
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,800
standardized field sobriety tests what

249
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,839
happens today is if I if I pull someone

250
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:23,039
over I I was just a a regular roadside

251
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,040
officer I did not have any uh um

252
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,879
extensive training in in drug impairment

253
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,319
I will pull someone over if they exhibit

254
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:33,838
signs maybe in their driving and maybe

255
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,560
with their uh eyes and their uh speech

256
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,040
that indicate some kind of impairment

257
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:39,879
then I would administer field spride

258
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,078
tests to that driver if the driver again

259
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,278
indicated that there's some kind of

260
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:44,399
impairment maybe they can't follow

261
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:46,120
instructions or they can't touch their

262
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,639
finger to their nose appropriately right

263
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,839
that the tests that you've all seen

264
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,399
before um I would call out a drug

265
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,120
recognition expert or I would arrest

266
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,440
that driver if I had probable cause to

267
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,360
make the address and I would transport

268
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,519
them to the office for a further

269
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,959
evaluation by a drug recognition expert

270
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,200
that is if I don't think they're under

271
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,838
the influence of strictly alcohol a drug

272
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,200
recognition expert officer receives uh

273
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,399
two weeks of of of specialized training

274
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,278
and an additional one week of

275
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,078
certifications out in the

276
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,958
field our prosecutions and I and I I

277
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,120
don't want to speak for for prosecutors

278
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:20,359
but from what I've heard and what I've

279
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,759
experienced is that prosecutions are are

280
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,360
successful if a drug recognition expert

281
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,720
actually can evaluate the uh the person

282
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,079
they can they can come up with some uh

283
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,800
certainty that the person's either on

284
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:33,319
the influence of marijuana or some kind

285
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,519
of opioid some kind of narcotic or

286
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,879
amphetamine and and prosecutions are

287
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,240
successful the problem is with those

288
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,360
methods in the past they're they're

289
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,000
expensive it's difficult to to train

290
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,399
officers to become drug recognition

291
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,720
experts uh um very timec consuming to do

292
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,159
so and so with increased marijuana use

293
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,720
what we know we need is we need to have

294
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,719
better tools for the officer on the side

295
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,440
of the road because we will not always

296
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,000
have a Dr available uh and and that's

297
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,200
where the research really comes in right

298
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,399
now what's going on in in in UC San

299
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,079
Diego is research to to correlate the

300
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,759
standardized Fields variety tests that

301
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:09,120
were validated to detect alcohol to

302
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,720
correlate their use directly with

303
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,720
marijuana impairment so we think that's

304
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,120
a step in the right direction we hope

305
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,600
additional research along those lines as

306
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,600
well as Research into some of the

307
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,278
technology whether it's breath testing

308
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,800
in the field or oral fluid testing in

309
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:24,958
the field uh will will be effective for

310
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,159
us for for officers Frontline level

311
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,838
officers yeah no obviously we want to

312
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:30,679
keep all Californians safe especially

313
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,600
when they're using our roadways that's

314
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:34,359
probably the question I get uh the most

315
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,079
back home is how are we going to make

316
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,278
sure people are safe what are they doing

317
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,679
and then you know you talk to them about

318
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,480
the the money set aside to help with the

319
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:47,479
research in this department but is there

320
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,159
any uh just from your past dealings any

321
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,120
loopholes or something that needs to be

322
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,159
clarified in regulation that we can do

323
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,078
meanwhile while this research is being

324
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,240
done just to help improve the safety in

325
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:57,239
our

326
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,240
roadways yeah you we had a lot of

327
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,480
discussions with the administration and

328
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,839
other licensing authorities and and uh

329
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,440
I'd like to continue those discussions

330
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,440
sir and and certainly get back to you

331
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,320
and any other any other members who are

332
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,800
interested in this topic but I'm sure we

333
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
will as we go further down the line we

334
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,559
will identify areas that that may

335
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,680
require some legislative tweaks so thank

336
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,439
you for asking yeah no I appreciate that

337
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,519
I know we started with CHP obviously we

338
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,720
have questions for the Department of

339
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,480
Justice also but I believe Mr D had a

340
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:31,160
question for uh CHP thank you uh Mr

341
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:34,600
chairman so uh just just to follow up on

342
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:36,120
uh Chairman's uh question on on the

343
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,480
timing of when you think there'll be

344
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,440
more technology out to

345
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,278
um you know predict what the level is so

346
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,959
for for our business I'm I'm going to

347
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,360
talk about B the business side of it not

348
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,679
so much recreational side of it so for

349
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,680
us we have a trucking company my wife

350
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,719
and I own a trucking company so they're

351
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:55,120
the employees that drive trucks are you

352
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,040
can't have a recreational habit or or

353
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,000
used marijuana it's it's banned so we

354
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:02,439
have to make sure that they're they're

355
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,320
not not a cannabis user uh but the other

356
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,399
employees that I have that aren't

357
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,519
driving a truck and aren't in a drug

358
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,559
program um and aren't required to be in

359
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,879
one so let me give you an example they

360
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,518
they drive a company vehicle to the farm

361
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,679
on the way out to the farm they get an

362
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,240
accident and you know they had used uh

363
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,479
recreational marijuana on the weekend

364
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,919
but weren't impaired at the time but

365
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,959
it's still in their system right uh and

366
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,759
somebody gets injured it's my vehicle

367
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:31,198
now I'm on the hook for how do I so

368
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:33,278
there's a big gray area here for for

369
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:35,240
businesses in California that first of

370
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:39,600
all may not know that their employees

371
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,799
are using uh a recreational drug and or

372
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,000
then who's liable and and we where the

373
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:46,120
so for us we're we just want to abide by

374
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,399
the laws and we don't we want to risk uh

375
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,560
reduce our risk uh but we don't have a

376
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,600
tool to to measure the amount or when

377
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:58,319
and that's a real problem for businesses

378
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,240
in California right and I I mean yes so

379
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,199
that that that's problem obviously for

380
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,519
for for us as well and I think uh uh

381
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,559
once again people look for a correlation

382
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,519
with alcohol where we have that specific

383
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,198
08 standard where we have through

384
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,000
through scientific research through

385
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,479
studies we can say with some level of

386
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,879
certainty that if you're an ' 08 that is

387
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,320
you're impaired regardless of whether

388
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,958
you use alcohol all the time or you use

389
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,278
it occasionally um so the challenge is

390
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,359
really is toofold is is how do we

391
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,600
develop or correlate impairment with

392
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,720
marijuana use which is so much different

393
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,639
uh and then how do we how do we measure

394
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,480
it to give you an industry or law

395
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,039
enforcement any level of certainty I I

396
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,879
can tell you that there are there are

397
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,480
devices out there for oral fluid testing

398
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,679
that have been the subject of a lot a

399
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,039
lot of study by uh the national highway

400
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,719
traffic safety administration and we've

401
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,240
had discussions with them but of course

402
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,600
they don't provide a level and so that's

403
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,399
an inherent drawback they do provide

404
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,000
information about the presence of

405
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,799
marijuana amphetamine heroin other

406
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,240
illegal drugs so there is some value um

407
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,719
and then there are some other devices

408
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,680
that that from what we have read are

409
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,199
still I think in their infancy but have

410
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:07,919
a great deal of Promise where they would

411
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,319
measure a level in your breath and I

412
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,958
think for us what we really want to see

413
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,800
is see this technology developed and and

414
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:16,799
have uh to the point where we have a

415
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,359
much higher level of uh confidence in in

416
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,039
in using them from the law enforcement

417
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,639
perspective and hopefully that would

418
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:23,399
have a sign benefit side benefit to

419
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,799
Industry as well I hope that's respon

420
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,839
just a quick followup so are the other

421
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,599
states that have legalized it are are

422
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,240
they I'm sure that they're in the same

423
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,360
boat we are at least their businesses

424
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,680
and their law enforcement is there maybe

425
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,600
we could work together with those other

426
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,239
states to you know put some more

427
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,519
resources in there to get it get some

428
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,720
sort of uh tool that we can allow the

429
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,519
measurement of it because that would

430
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,680
really help uh in all the processing of

431
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,278
who's doing what at when okay yes yes

432
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,198
and and we are doing it thank you sir

433
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:53,240
thank you uh Mr wood thank you Mr chair

434
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,240
I guess my just kind of a followup uh

435
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,839
again um so obviously the drug

436
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,839
recognition experts are are very

437
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,160
expensive um and I I know that certainly

438
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,920
in my some of my counties uh getting

439
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,838
convictions for driving under the

440
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,919
influence of cannabis has been very very

441
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,160
difficult um and probably because of the

442
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,519
lack of resources so in addition to the

443
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,958
$3 million that's going into research

444
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,399
are you seeing additional resources uh

445
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,318
for making sure that there are drug

446
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,440
recognition experts we're going to still

447
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:26,278
potentially need that anyway regardless

448
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,319
of what technology we use for to detect

449
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:30,958
and impairment there's multiple kinds of

450
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:32,759
impairment so are you seeking are you

451
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,599
expecting additional resources to help

452
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:40,879
with that yes so so prop 64 is is uh uh

453
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,839
part of its funding um scheme is that a

454
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,318
certain percentage of the tax dollars

455
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,920
will go to the highway patrol now it

456
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:49,078
doesn't say exactly how much but it does

457
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,639
set a floor of $50 million per year it

458
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,318
could potentially be more we you know

459
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,839
there's been projections that are all

460
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:55,639
over the map so we don't know exactly

461
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,279
how much it will be but that money we

462
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,680
will be able to uh use to administer

463
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:04,919
grants to local agencies to train more

464
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:07,399
Personnel for uh uh uh Dr and and and

465
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,038
better impairment detection uh to to

466
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,959
help them get better technology um to

467
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:14,558
put more officers out on the street for

468
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:18,160
for uh DUI prevention detection and

469
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:20,838
prevention the also the the Dr program

470
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,600
as it exists today is funded by grants

471
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,038
from the national highway traffic safety

472
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,599
administration and uh OTS administers

473
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,599
those grants for the State of California

474
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,439
and that money obviously keeps coming in

475
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:32,480
from the federal government as well so

476
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,759
we continue to get a funding stream

477
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,919
today and we anticipate getting a much

478
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:39,359
larger funding stream to to improve law

479
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:42,480
enforcement's ability to to apprehend

480
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,199
impaired drivers um but you know we

481
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,558
don't know how much that's going to be U

482
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,000
because it's it's obviously the funding

483
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:50,079
is not going to come until the 1819 uh

484
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
fiscal year to the CHP we're in the

485
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,918
process right now I I referenced us re

486
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,558
uh restructuring things administratively

487
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,080
so we'll be in a position to administer

488
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,440
these Grant fundings and we're not we're

489
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,879
not going to do it in vacuum I want to

490
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,000
assure you of that as well because we we

491
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,360
we plan to convene groups and we're

492
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,519
already part of of stakeholder groups of

493
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,879
cons composed of crime Labs prosecutors

494
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,798
our local agencies to make sure when we

495
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,360
administer the grant funding it's going

496
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:18,158
out to the right places to get the

497
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,479
biggest bang for our bug of course great

498
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,159
thank you assembly member

499
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,159
Lackey yeah let me Begin by apologizing

500
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,360
for my

501
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:31,080
voice it's

502
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,079
impaired it is a joint

503
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,880
hearing

504
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,440
sorry nicely

505
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,880
done I think what what's really missing

506
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,880
in this discussion is the real important

507
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,559
difficulty in in identifying a pyramid

508
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,400
in marijuana versus

509
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:53,038
usage uh Nationwide there's a lot of

510
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:56,720
focus on establishing per limits when in

511
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:58,919
fact marijuana has a very unique uh

512
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,640
distinction to it in the fact that its

513
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,280
impairing levels are for a uh not for a

514
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,880
sustained period of time usually only a

515
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:11,879
couple hours and right now the science

516
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,559
is uh able to detect metabolized THC

517
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,480
when in fact that's not a strong

518
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:20,038
indicator of impairment so the tools

519
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,279
that we're trying to bring forward and I

520
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:26,279
think that your department is trying to

521
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:29,440
um bring notoriety and trust and value

522
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,678
in is also being uh

523
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,400
looked at by UC San Diego in the study

524
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,759
that was the result of uh AB

525
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,159
266 and specifically the field sobriety

526
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:44,440
tests are being developed to address

527
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:47,320
specific marijuana levels of impairment

528
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,400
the impairment levels are different and

529
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,000
and the impairment in itself is

530
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,559
different than alcohol and so that's

531
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,359
what makes it very very difficult for

532
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:58,440
the roadside officer to be able to

533
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:01,479
identify to impairment and so what we

534
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,759
need need is uh and I'm trying to

535
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,679
address that through my own process uh

536
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,879
to bring policy that will allow your

537
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,559
agency to lead the country and be able

538
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,320
to identify impairment before we start

539
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,678
talking about per se limits and I think

540
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:18,439
that we're getting the cart before the

541
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,240
horse when we're trying to establish per

542
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:27,200
se limits when clearly we don't have

543
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:29,798
really uh strong verifiable Pathways uh

544
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,679
for the regular roadside offic to to

545
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:36,679
determine just impairment so I look

546
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:39,200
forward to your agency's uh leadership

547
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,720
and to be able to help make that

548
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,558
distinction between uh impairment and

549
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,440
usage because um unfortunately there are

550
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,319
probably some people who have been

551
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,038
punished for just usage when in fact

552
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:56,158
impairment was in question and that's

553
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,599
what we do not want so I I just want

554
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,400
everybody to be clear that the

555
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,719
California high Patrol understands that

556
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,038
distinction and is working very very

557
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,159
diligently to uh be able to build the

558
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:10,009
confidence and to remove truly impaired

559
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:20,319
people because they are the threat

560
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:20,318
