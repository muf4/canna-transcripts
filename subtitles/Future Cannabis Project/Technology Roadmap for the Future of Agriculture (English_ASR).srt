00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:13,830
today we have grant Van Daan Bush from

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,600
fifth-season Chris Higgins from hor

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,910
Americas and Matt kobori from calyx King

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,189
they'll each be talking about issues

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,359
that they see in the market right now

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:30,960
and then how futuristic solutions can

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,300
can meet those issues and and needs of

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,200
the customer hi so I'm grant van Busche

10
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,030
I spoke earlier just another quick piece

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,280
of background on me so I was at General

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,340
Mills for a little over five years a

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,870
large portion of that time I spent

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,340
working on the energy risk management

15
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:48,899
strategy for General Mills looking at a

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,969
lot of distributed energy platforms

17
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,579
looking at a lot of cogeneration systems

18
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,550
as well as how we thought about our both

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,980
our diesel natural gas and electricity

20
00:00:55,549 --> 00:01:01,288
risk programs so when I when I joined

21
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:04,319
fifth-season I think as I mentioned

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,269
earlier we had a very tiny farming

23
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,399
technology system and and we knew that

24
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,618
our whole thesis was to try and pull the

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,030
labor out of the out of the growing and

26
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,040
we knew that once we did that that

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,719
energy would be the largest cost so we

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,210
tried to be very thoughtful about how we

29
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,060
built energy solutions into our growing

30
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:22,859
platform and some of what I'm gonna

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,570
share with you today is is actually how

32
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,849
we've done that and how we've set

33
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:29,669
ourselves up to to optimize energy over

34
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:32,129
the long term so I certainly want to go

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,189
into that I'll try and be brief about it

36
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:36,780
so so this is our facility this is the

37
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:38,719
the facility that is coming online right

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,570
now as I mentioned earlier we'll have

39
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:45,030
products on shelves within the next 30

40
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,398
to 45 days this isn't a steel town

41
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,739
called Braddock that is the it's called

42
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,560
us Edgar Thompson steel that's actually

43
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,938
Andrew Carnegie's former manager it's

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,340
where he invented the Braddock press

45
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:58,289
which ultimately made him a little bit

46
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,020
of cash so it's a one point five

47
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,759
megawatt facility with human-free

48
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,989
consistent and controlled by odomes so

49
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,209
what's going on underneath the roof

50
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:09,060
there is is what you're looking at in

51
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:12,269
that actually that's a two scale diagram

52
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,750
what we have is a tray loop system where

53
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,550
we've really taken the method

54
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,740
of an automated fulfillment center and

55
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,960
used that as a platform to grow plants

56
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,909
so instead of moving around pallets of

57
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,159
boxes we're moving around pallets of

58
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:26,229
plants and so as you think about an

59
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,689
automated processing and automated

60
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:31,030
growing an automated harvesting and an

61
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:33,219
automated packaging system that's how

62
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,349
that moves around in our full loop and

63
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:38,080
we have two biodomes that we have

64
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:41,439
complete control over so what that means

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,350
is that we can be a lot more precise so

66
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,479
so from a control standpoint these are

67
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:49,750
this is an example of one of our panels

68
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,488
we have over a hundred panels inside of

69
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,340
the full system and then on our breaker

70
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:56,560
we have high resolution information

71
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,750
gathering and what that allows us to do

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,189
is feed everything into our system and

73
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,139
so when we talk about smart

74
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:04,419
manufacturing this is really allows us

75
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,669
to be better about our scheduling so

76
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:09,579
with the human free grow rooms we don't

77
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:12,069
have to wait for a day shift or wait for

78
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,110
a night shift in order to move plants

79
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:15,340
around to the optimal space we don't

80
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,440
have to wait for a day shift or wait for

81
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,920
a night shift in order to kick on

82
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,900
irrigation or kick on fans or even bring

83
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,449
things out that allows us to be very

84
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,120
very smart around how we schedule and

85
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:29,859
use use our electricity so so it's the

86
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,719
combination of these things and then

87
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,620
also within the system being able to

88
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:38,409
augment them so so from an energy

89
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,480
optimization standpoint what we're doing

90
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:43,329
is is we publish grow recipes into our

91
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,119
software system so those grow recipes

92
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:47,950
each each one of them has an energy

93
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,200
assumption in a buffer window for that

94
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:53,280
and so as we think about filling up that

95
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,810
biodome with all of these different

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,030
individual orders if you will that the

97
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,750
system then takes care of the system is

98
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,909
reoptimize until energy usage is based

99
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,590
on top of that and then our system is

100
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:07,750
also combining that with our high res

101
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,729
monitoring based on all the smart panels

102
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,530
that we've created to look at and say

103
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:13,599
okay if we were planning on using this

104
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,250
much energy and our actual energy

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,319
consumption was this why is there that

106
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,728
variance and a lot of times because we

107
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,858
have these buffer zones and our grow

108
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:22,899
recipes what that allows us to do is be

109
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:25,000
smarter about how we how we use energy

110
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:26,849
everything's done to a quality standard

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,470
so it's not like we are

112
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,080
sacrificing quality on a lot of these

113
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,490
things it's just when we when we think

114
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,430
about blending product together or we

115
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,259
think about creating packages of that

116
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,329
come from multiple trays you might be

117
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,279
able to shave an hour here or an hour

118
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:43,500
there when you think about this full

119
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,319
full scheduling problem and in one

120
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,970
instance and then finally we have micro

121
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,659
grid so that's really about connecting

122
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:54,360
this entire energy schedule or this

123
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,640
entire energy portfolio along with

124
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,620
what's happening inside of inside of the

125
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,930
grader inside of your what's happening

126
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,399
locally so this is a micro grid

127
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,650
architecture we work with scale micro

128
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,379
grid they have been fantastic partners

129
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:10,019
capital is always a struggle when you

130
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:12,480
are a young startup so you so scale

131
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,699
micro grids innovative platform to to

132
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,310
really reduce that capital requirement

133
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:20,159
has been very helpful to us the solar

134
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,449
can can really generate about can really

135
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,370
generate a pretty significant amount of

136
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,050
electricity for us it's not you know

137
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,840
sound a hundred percent of our of our

138
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,910
yield or sorry of our requirements and

139
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,310
we also have a standby generator that's

140
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,170
fed by NAT gas that can kick on so the

141
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,730
three days of resiliency is huge for us

142
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,100
in the event that there is a grid outage

143
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,660
our neighbors next door they kind of

144
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,470
pulled out of power and do have a lot of

145
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:47,730
demand and a lot of say to the utility

146
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:49,470
but that that capability for us to have

147
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,840
the understanding for how we are

148
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,460
impacting the grid and the flexibility

149
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,989
for how we want to run our operation is

150
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,569
huge when you think about curtailment

151
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,189
and other types of activities so we're

152
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,719
literally just starting this up I wish I

153
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:03,089
had actual numbers that I could post on

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,100
here this is our our projected monthly

155
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:07,289
load versus available generation I

156
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,910
absolutely cannot wait until we do have

157
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,790
that data and we can share it with you

158
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,939
because to my knowledge we are the first

159
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:17,370
real manufacturing process that has

160
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:20,160
dynamic load-balancing that we can do

161
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:23,370
inside of a human free operation so I

162
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:29,490
just get really really geeked up about

163
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:32,519
what that can do sorry yeah so my name

164
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,319
is Chris Higgins I am the general

165
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,759
manager and co-owner of hoard America's

166
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,918
hoard America's there's a texas-based

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,779
company Dallas Texas based company and

168
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,620
what we really are is we're a wholesale

169
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,168
supply company

170
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,180
but over the last decade we've really

171
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:46,740
focused on controlled environment

172
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,110
agriculture and for us that means

173
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,060
anything from a tissue culture facility

174
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,949
to an indoor vertical farm to a

175
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,470
greenhouse we work with those growers

176
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:58,050
and helping them develop and implement

177
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,580
their ideas as well as providing with

178
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,319
them supplies after they're up and

179
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:06,359
growing my business partners are from

180
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,610
the Netherlands they are a Dutch grower

181
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,040
cooperative with about 125 years of

182
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,449
experience so in essence my board is

183
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,819
made up of about a thousand Dutch

184
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,590
greenhouse growers so we get a lot of

185
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,120
input from the Netherlands and that's

186
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:21,478
shaped a lot of what we've done over the

187
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,850
years our vision is to be leading North

188
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:25,409
American wholesale supply company and

189
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,729
that's kind of shifting right now

190
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,490
because what we've realized over the

191
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:30,870
years is that many of the growers we're

192
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,819
working with today especially those

193
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,709
looking at growing food crops in unique

194
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,120
environments need more than just a

195
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:39,060
supply company and they need a partner

196
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,530
they need a partner to talk about what

197
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,019
others are doing that they find

198
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,189
successful what equipment they may be

199
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:47,038
able to use that they don't have to

200
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,870
completely reinvent and other ways of

201
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,500
helping them manage costs because many

202
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,360
of them are on a very tight budget and

203
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,490
what that causes us to do is link the

204
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,490
grower with manufacturers that we've

205
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,629
vetted and Trust we do have a

206
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,460
demonstration greenhouse in downtown

207
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:05,038
Dallas it's connected with the State

208
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:08,339
Fair of Texas so if anybody's ever in

209
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,659
Dallas and wants to visit and see seven

210
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:11,579
or eight growing systems right now I

211
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,699
don't know what we have it's open 365

212
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:18,659
days a year it's about a hundred yards

213
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:21,810
from the old Cotton Bowl and during the

214
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,330
month of October we get about 400,000

215
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,899
visitors right now so it's become kind

216
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:30,240
of an agritourism spot but in there

217
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,639
you'll see that we will run product

218
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,469
demonstration with new products from

219
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,580
some of our vendor partners like General

220
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:40,709
Electric grow tin other sensor companies

221
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,089
like 30 megahertz and our goal is to

222
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,889
figure out that this technology can work

223
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:46,260
not for the most technically

224
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:48,360
technologically advanced group of people

225
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,730
but that the average grower can make

226
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,620
this equipment work and you'll find

227
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,029
we've had to prove this to ourselves

228
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,490
because our

229
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:58,679
growing team consists of the landscapers

230
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,669
that run the State Fair that's itself so

231
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,589
we have to teach this to a bunch of

232
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:04,500
landscapers who have no horticulture

233
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,450
degree would probably be more

234
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,620
comfortable driving a lawn mower than

235
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:13,230
you know calibrating EC and pH so the

236
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,009
way we look at the business is we try to

237
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:19,649
simplify it there is a question asked

238
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:22,230
about you know did they sell weight or

239
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,850
do they sell units in the last panel and

240
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,430
I thought the answer was interesting

241
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,100
because the units are essentially weight

242
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:32,489
so for a grower of ours that's growing a

243
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,779
head of bib lettuce we know that there

244
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,419
is a certain weight that fills up a

245
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,279
clamshell and we know that there are you

246
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:41,009
know handful of clam shells that most of

247
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,350
the produce buyers want to receive so

248
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:45,299
they may be selling a unit but inside

249
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,210
that unit is a weight that we have to

250
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:50,219
meet so I'm similar to agriculture

251
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,070
throughout the years our growers are

252
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,509
dealing with yield and in order to be

253
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:59,520
profitable we really have to send

254
00:09:54,509 --> 00:10:01,139
understand those yield economics and our

255
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,909
ability to help those growers be

256
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,850
profitable is what's going to lead to

257
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:09,230
our longevity so again we're based in

258
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:12,360
Texas we service all of North America

259
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:17,009
with customers as far south as Brazil

260
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,330
and as far north as Barrow Alaska and we

261
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:20,819
do have customers internationally as

262
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,139
well this this slide just really kind of

263
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,089
leads into what I finished up there we

264
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:25,830
are you know we as a company are focused

265
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,890
on collaboration focus and

266
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:31,050
open-mindedness one of the things we see

267
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:33,059
with the industry is that there are a

268
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:35,819
lot of people that are protecting

269
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:37,409
themselves with a lot of NDA's if we

270
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,530
look at the history of controlled

271
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:43,769
environment agriculture and we use the

272
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,329
Dutch model as maybe a case study the

273
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,460
interesting thing about that model is

274
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,730
that they are very open as long as you

275
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,440
speak Dutch but all the greenhouse has

276
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,000
essentially looked the same and what

277
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,160
that means is that those greenhouses

278
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,169
while the systems inside are slightly

279
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,029
different what that means is that their

280
00:10:58,169 --> 00:11:02,039
ability to share helps them share the

281
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,929
cost and it helps them build their

282
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,559
industry not only in the Netherlands but

283
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,269
as they export globally

284
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,399
so that's something that we would like

285
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:11,590
to see come to the US and come to North

286
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,159
America would be more of an openness of

287
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:17,110
sharing what are the best practices and

288
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,329
using those best practices to drive our

289
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,340
industry forward not just drive an

290
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,620
individual business forward or an

291
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,970
individual opportunity forward but to

292
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,769
drive the industry forward because with

293
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,360
that we will start to change the

294
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,860
opportunities that we have in the United

295
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,019
States we will start to possibly

296
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,690
manufacture some more stuff here versus

297
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:38,970
just importing everything from either

298
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:40,960
Northern Europe art or Asia and again

299
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,028
encouraging everybody to be open and

300
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,080
receptive to new ideas is key for for

301
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:49,210
our company my name is matthew kobori i

302
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,520
am an owner and operator in the cannabis

303
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:54,550
industry in several different market

304
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,409
segments primarily through calyx culture

305
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:58,509
which is a tissue culture and genetic

306
00:11:56,409 --> 00:12:00,309
breeding company and house of cultivar

307
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,528
which is a recreational adult use

308
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:04,689
cannabis brand headquartered in Seattle

309
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:06,700
Washington but also with presence in

310
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,150
California and hopefully in 2020 in

311
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,460
Massachusetts as well and in addition my

312
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:14,829
desire and passion for sustainability

313
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,860
has brought me onto the board of the

314
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,500
resource innovation Institute as well I

315
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,180
started off about over a decade ago in

316
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,700
my basement with one little grow light

317
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:27,699
as a hobby and has a passion and then

318
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,100
quickly through education and

319
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,350
architecture expanded that out through

320
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,060
one grow light to four grow lights and

321
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,009
then I built out my basement and then a

322
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:37,838
small garage and then from there a

323
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:39,939
warehouse and then as the the medical

324
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,220
laws and recreational law is expanded in

325
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,460
Washington State we grew and evolved and

326
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,899
from that first basement to the 50,000

327
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,720
square foot building that were in now in

328
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,899
downtown Seattle there's always been an

329
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,790
issue of power and from from a very

330
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,409
functional standpoint no building that

331
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:58,569
we ever started off with had enough

332
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:00,669
power so has always been a process of

333
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,550
trying to reverse engineer what your

334
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:07,149
outputs are based upon the limitations

335
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:08,109
of the grid or your local location so

336
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:10,389
for us it's always been a very

337
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,580
functional requirement to have to be as

338
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,708
sustainable as possible so from that

339
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,620
very early instance about 10 years ago

340
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,859
to now we have been constantly trying to

341
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,080
evolve the

342
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,810
oh jeez I mean I remember building led

343
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,970
getting Cree you know uh diodes and

344
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:27,559
building LEDs in my basement trying to

345
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,450
think that it was going to be the the

346
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:31,669
revolution which through you know

347
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,930
companies here today have really taken

348
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:35,809
it to that next level and it allowed us

349
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:37,189
to capitalize on those technologies but

350
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:39,559
what I really want to talk about today

351
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,470
is some of the methodology that goes

352
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:44,839
beyond what you see in conventional

353
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,879
agriculture and what is specific to to

354
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,129
cannabis and a big part of that is the

355
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,259
product selection so if any of you have

356
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:53,689
ever been into a retail dispensary or

357
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:55,370
storefront you've noticed the huge

358
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,780
selection of different strains and

359
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,879
genetics and products that are on the

360
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:01,399
marketplace and each one of those

361
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,210
genetics has a certain requirement for

362
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:08,179
it and a lot of it comes down to space

363
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:10,759
area light water labor and supplies

364
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:12,679
materials conventionally what we have

365
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,269
done is we've created mother plants and

366
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:16,279
then from those mother plants that

367
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,379
mother stock we've created clones and

368
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,269
then the clones create the production

369
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:22,879
plants which then create the products

370
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:24,559
but for every string for every different

371
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,809
product that you have that means that

372
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,089
you have to keep a mother plant alive to

373
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:31,250
represent and to hold that genetic to

374
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,680
create that propagation that means that

375
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,990
a lot at least one large plant is going

376
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,359
to be necessary for each one of those

377
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,590
things and that is a light that is water

378
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,269
that goes into that plant and that's

379
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:43,330
time and labor that those employees

380
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:46,669
spend dealing with it

381
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:48,650
so for us what we try to do was how do

382
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:49,579
we take that and they consolidate that

383
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,600
because that's how you're gonna be the

384
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,850
most efficient and that's how you're

385
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,450
gonna reduce your resource usage so for

386
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,920
us we we have spent a lot of time doing

387
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,290
a lot of research and development and

388
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,959
perfecting the the art and sciences of

389
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:04,699
tissue culture of micropropagation what

390
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,070
micropropagation has allowed us to do is

391
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,990
essentially take these large mother

392
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,750
plants and the large amount area

393
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,149
resources and consolidate that into in

394
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,769
vitro test tubes and essentially take

395
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:18,679
all of our mother stock and propagation

396
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:20,240
stock that took up about eighty five

397
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,579
hundred square feet in our in our

398
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,330
Seattle facility and consolidate that

399
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:29,540
down to about 1500 square feet of space

400
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:32,150
it is it has allowed us to reduce our

401
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:32,750
load quite significantly and it in

402
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,569
addition

403
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,669
a lot of operational benefits as well we

404
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,400
have a lot cleaner plant stock were able

405
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:42,229
to reduce contamination spread and we're

406
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,360
able to actually have a much more

407
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,700
efficient operational process which

408
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,070
reduces costs and resources in the

409
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,830
downstream processes through different

410
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,970
IPM measures different technology that a

411
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,930
lot of people have to put in place to

412
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,190
mitigate stuff and and contamination and

413
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:59,569
negative consequences from that that we

414
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,120
can get rid of in the tissue culture

415
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,250
process so not only does it consolidate

416
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,950
the space but it also provides for a

417
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:10,610
much more streamlined operation

418
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:14,150
downstream so as I said we we converted

419
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:16,399
those large mom rooms into the lab space

420
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:18,250
so this is the example in Seattle of

421
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,870
about eighty five hundred square feet of

422
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,269
original mom in genetic storage space

423
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,940
that was taking up you know had about 15

424
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:28,519
tons tons HVAC as well supplying it we

425
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,590
we had even gone through a lighting

426
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,210
rebate and had converted all of our

427
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:36,590
thousand watt metal halide fixtures over

428
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:39,080
to 315 315 watt surrett male high light

429
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,290
fixtures but we were still using roughly

430
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,850
a little over a hundred thousand watts

431
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:45,889
whereas in the new tissue culture lab

432
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:48,529
we're down to about fourteen thousand

433
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:49,850
watts so as you can see a significant

434
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,500
decrease from eighty five hundred square

435
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,240
feet to fifteen hundred square feet and

436
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,669
from over a hundred thousand watts to

437
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,310
fourteen thousand watts doing the exact

438
00:16:55,669 --> 00:17:00,139
same operational protocol and even

439
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,779
expanding our genetic library and

440
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:04,279
storage capabilities so you know as a

441
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:06,289
grower and somebody who's operationally

442
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,109
functionally in the marketplace you know

443
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:10,609
one thing that I want to try to express

444
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,139
to everybody as we look at the

445
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,879
advancements in the industry it's not

446
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,740
only in the technology that's required

447
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,689
to do this but also in the methodology

448
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,650
and the approaches when you go and you

449
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:22,550
visit you know grows you're gonna see

450
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,650
there's a million different ways to skin

451
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:26,419
the cat no to two operations are doing

452
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,459
it the same and I think as we progress

453
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,810
and as we advance we need to start to

454
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,060
create some of those standards as we

455
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:33,440
discussed earlier and start to share

456
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:35,809
resources on how we can change

457
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,460
methodologies to then put the proper

458
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:38,929
equipment in place to really see those

459
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,590
advancements and those reductions in

460
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:46,430
resource usage thank you and now we'll

461
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:48,889
take questions a couple of you mentioned

462
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:52,340
praia teri advancements and NDA's as

463
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,890
part of this work and i wonder how do we

464
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:57,529
balance those proprietary advancements

465
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,850
and NDA's with opportunities that could

466
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,859
kind of lift all boats

467
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:02,980
new important ideas for the entire

468
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:06,469
industry and how do we kind of balance

469
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,670
those two things I'll jump in on this

470
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,230
one and I think it's because we've

471
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,880
experienced this so much I mean

472
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,759
especially in the canvas side of things

473
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,100
people think that they're they're their

474
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,529
trade secrets are really their ultimate

475
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:21,289
success factor which is in my opinion

476
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:25,220
with what is slowing down the progress

477
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:27,019
and even retarding individual growth in

478
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,240
a company's business planning strategy I

479
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:30,619
really think that through organizations

480
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,269
like the resource innovation Institute

481
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,309
you know bringing like-minded

482
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:37,730
individuals together to share really is

483
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:39,169
the best way to transcend that and I

484
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,089
think the way that we do that is to show

485
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:43,420
value with the information that's coming

486
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:46,099
out so I think you know through these

487
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,620
standards setting groups getting that

488
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:51,740
information percolated out to the widest

489
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:53,449
audience possible in as a cost effective

490
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:57,440
manner I think is the way in which we

491
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,700
spread it as quickly as possible the

492
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,549
only thing I would add there is is

493
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,370
making sure you as a group we understand

494
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:07,059
what's worth protecting and what has

495
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:09,679
been around for a long period of time

496
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:10,190
I've been in the industry for about 25

497
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,789
years

498
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,380
and I would say about once a month I get

499
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:17,659
a phone call from somebody who has a

500
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,990
really awesome new idea

501
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:24,290
and the idea has been around a long time

502
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:28,279
right so in a lot of ways we want to

503
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:29,389
protect the easiest one I've always uses

504
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,299
a lot of people want to protect the

505
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:34,670
irrigation system but all we are doing

506
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:36,589
is using irrigation systems that have

507
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,840
been around for 30 or 40 years

508
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:40,939
so so making sure you've done your work

509
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,349
you've done your research and you can

510
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,009
understand okay am I really doing

511
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:48,289
anything different or am I just slightly

512
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:49,990
modifying the way I'm moving water that

513
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:53,599
that's in itself is not worth protecting

514
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,250
but there are things that are right in

515
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,929
understanding what those are and how

516
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,730
those benefit you and your organization

517
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,740
I think are key in helping move

518
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,839
everything forward because if

519
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,160
open yourself up a little bit somebody

520
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,169
may have already made all the mistakes

521
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,259
that you're getting ready to make and

522
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:11,650
they can save you a lot of money in time

523
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:14,319
by helping you through those things hi I

524
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:16,360
had a question about understanding the

525
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,250
incremental cost between what you could

526
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,169
have done and the innovative choice that

527
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,929
you did choose to do and how you were

528
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,308
able to perhaps calculate that yourself

529
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:26,200
and communicate it to your stakeholders

530
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:27,879
investors and maybe even the utilities

531
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,558
because oftentimes that's what the

532
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,260
utilities want to know in order to

533
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:34,599
incentivize some sort of inventive or

534
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:36,429
cutting-edge technology so finding out

535
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:38,709
the ROI knowing the incremental cost

536
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:44,019
between traditional choice versus paving

537
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:46,360
a new path yeah that's a great question

538
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:48,509
thank you for asking that Gretchen right

539
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:50,619
yeah thank you for asking a question so

540
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:52,720
let me just talk about our switchgear

541
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:54,219
real quick because when we first looked

542
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,380
at doing the switchgear I think our

543
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,850
project or electrical engineer and the

544
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,440
project said that that was going to cost

545
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:02,379
us a million dollars more in capital

546
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,000
because our our I'm sorry let me talk

547
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,500
about our micro grid because he said

548
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,029
that you know that we had to upgrade the

549
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,589
switchgear to be the greatest switchgear

550
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,289
that's ever existed before on the planet

551
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:13,149
of Earth or something like that so so

552
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,730
that was that was a big that was a big

553
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,040
hurdle for us that took some time you

554
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:19,808
know the local builder on the project

555
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,970
really liked Siemens switch gears and

556
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:24,099
for our project we had to go with a

557
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,650
Schneider switch gear so it was making

558
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:27,849
spending a lot of time with that with

559
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,769
that builder getting them very

560
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:31,209
comfortable with the technology gave

561
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:32,589
them very comfortable with the install

562
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,900
process getting them very comfortable

563
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:37,029
with the corresponding effect and making

564
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,070
sure that but I think you asked the

565
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:40,690
commissioning question earlier getting

566
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:42,039
that that sequenced into the full

567
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,420
commissioning plan and how that would

568
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,269
fit and how that would fit with the

569
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:49,120
local utility electrical inspector and

570
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:51,759
what would what would be that process so

571
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,439
that was something that we we knew that

572
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,359
we we needed to do this and we knew that

573
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,750
it was something that had to happen at

574
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:01,209
zero incremental capital to us and so

575
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:04,119
that was an example of where we relied

576
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,549
heavily on external partners to come in

577
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:09,339
and sit down and take everybody through

578
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:12,190
the pictures videos everything else to

579
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:13,720
get the local constructors the local

580
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,400
builders the local people on

581
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,259
with the technology familiar with

582
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,030
everything so that way we could realize

583
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:21,430
no was not a 1 million dollar

584
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:23,769
incremental switchgear cost it was

585
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,029
actually you know apples to apples once

586
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:28,599
you figured it out it was the exact same

587
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:30,579
switch so that was really big for us we

588
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,409
also looked pretty significantly at a

589
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:35,109
combined heat and power system that was

590
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,210
a decision we chose not to make for us

591
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:38,769
at that point in time that was actually

592
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,870
looking the other way looking at some of

593
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:44,170
the phenomenal advisors that we've had

594
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:46,449
on the on the HVAC side in terms of how

595
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,250
we were thinking about usage you know

596
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,230
that was just a it was a little bit too

597
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,420
much capital for us at this time and it

598
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,309
was a little bit too much of a slightly

599
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,980
potential risk to the commissioning plan

600
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:59,049
that we said you know what no there's

601
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,400
there's enough in this facility already

602
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:03,579
we don't we don't want to take on that

603
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,950
project as well it all comes down to I

604
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:09,849
think both the math problem and and what

605
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:11,350
you you feel comfortable doing just to

606
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:13,480
kind of add to that great comments by

607
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:16,000
the way um it's really just trying to

608
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,120
look long-term you know I think like

609
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,859
with most technology we advanced or

610
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,389
sustainable solutions there's an

611
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:25,599
additional upfront cost associated with

612
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:27,460
it so really looking at that ROI not in

613
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,889
a short-term one or two years but more

614
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,319
in the the five to 10 year realm really

615
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,509
makes things pencil out on paper to make

616
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,519
a lot more sense and also when you're

617
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:38,920
when you're looking at this from a prog

618
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:40,420
ative standpoint I don't think any of

619
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,980
these decisions that we're making are

620
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,360
necessarily short-term decisions whether

621
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,120
it be for our business or whether it be

622
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:51,369
for the planet Earth in general from a

623
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:52,750
sustainability standpoint for anybody on

624
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:54,189
the panel can you guys speak a little

625
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,960
bit to your experience and what you're

626
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,450
seeing right now with respect to water

627
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,850
or atmospheric water generation systems

628
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,410
Chris as you remember we had a system

629
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:05,529
from a Southern California company

630
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,730
called sky well at herbin produce which

631
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:08,319
was a great system but it was

632
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,720
problematic where we were able to

633
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,730
capture about 140 gallons a day what are

634
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,190
you guys seeing in terms of atmospheric

635
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,930
water generation systems in pure indoor

636
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,570
environments not necessarily greenhouse

637
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:24,310
but grant for you and other gentlemen

638
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:26,619
for you so the biggest ones for us an

639
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,548
indoor environment are the condensation

640
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:29,408
that's coming off

641
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:31,778
of any reach back components which

642
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:33,278
nowadays with filter ization that's out

643
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:34,659
there it's almost a no-brainer to be

644
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,730
able to capture that put that back into

645
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:38,799
your fertigation and then for most

646
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,149
hydroponic gardeners you know there is

647
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:41,829
somewhere between a fifteen to

648
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:42,969
twenty-five percent runoff that's

649
00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:45,038
typically happening through that

650
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,200
flushing process which you know most

651
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,849
people right now are you know mitigating

652
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,308
so that they can put into a sewer system

653
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:54,248
but there is lots of opportunity to

654
00:24:51,308 --> 00:24:58,349
recapture filter and reuse that water as

655
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:58,350
well those are the two biggest right now

656
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:03,100
yeah maybe just to add to that real

657
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,129
briefly so we have it we have a fill-in

658
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:07,658
drain system we we capture a lot of the

659
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:10,778
of the water that comes out of that I

660
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:13,239
don't know the exact percentage you know

661
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:15,608
for us water is it's really important

662
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:19,450
but it's not it when when I think about

663
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:21,428
the hierarchy of cost and strategies for

664
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,200
us it's it's something where it's it's

665
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:25,570
not the top of the list that's

666
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,950
prohibiting us from either you know

667
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:28,989
investing immediately in the next

668
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,700
project or or it's not it's not on the

669
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:32,259
top of our list for for solutions

670
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,450
because we can capture so much of it

671
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:36,278
it's important to us as a company

672
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,649
because we we think deeply about our

673
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:41,288
impact to the water cycle and what we're

674
00:25:38,648 --> 00:25:44,288
doing with nutrient-rich water but it's

675
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:49,148
it's not as important to us as figuring

676
00:25:44,288 --> 00:25:51,099
out the energy usage yeah and I would I

677
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:53,798
would add to that most of the farms that

678
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:59,798
we're working with on the indoor side

679
00:25:53,798 --> 00:26:01,868
right it is it should be much lower on

680
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:03,658
the priority list because their total

681
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:05,589
water consumption is fairly low

682
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,600
especially on the food producing side

683
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:09,398
and they're able to recirculate their

684
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:12,189
irrigation systems so frequently that

685
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:13,748
they're pretty water efficient when we

686
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,788
look at the you know the bigger

687
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:18,249
customers we have they're using lots of

688
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:20,679
water they have they're not implementing

689
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:23,200
those systems currently in terms of food

690
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,970
producing or flower production they are

691
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,679
more looking at how are they going to

692
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,868
capture rainwater how are they going to

693
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,980
be as efficient as they possibly can

694
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:31,329
when it comes to managing their

695
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,940
nutrients salts with inside their

696
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:36,009
irrigation system I think for us with

697
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,440
the majority the customers we have its

698
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:39,890
it is ok where can I have the biggest

699
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,570
impact today

700
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,940
and probably in figuring out how to make

701
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:46,279
their nutrient solution go longer by

702
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,630
using you know the right fertilizers and

703
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:49,910
the right measuring and sensing

704
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,670
equipment is probably a better way for

705
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:55,100
them to have a bigger impact on water

706
00:26:52,670 --> 00:27:01,700
than it is to capture that in the sphere

707
00:26:55,099 --> 00:27:03,049
of water I'll just add we've done some

708
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,420
research on water and whether they're

709
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:07,879
worth a whether it's worth incentivizing

710
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,890
from a utility perspective and at least

711
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:14,170
in the Northeast water is extremely

712
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:16,790
cheap and plentiful so it's usually not

713
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:19,190
it does not behoove us to look into

714
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:21,230
water incentives but that's very

715
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,970
geographically dependent of course if

716
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,610
you were looking at California that's

717
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:29,000
very very expensive and important water

718
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:31,699
so that is very Geographic just like

719
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,339
some states may care more about carbon

720
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,710
than other states right now so you'll

721
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:38,539
see those priorities switch depending on

722
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,519
where you're at I've heard a lot about

723
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:43,490
water here but it's really not a concern

724
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:46,099
of any of our customers in Vermont this

725
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,779
is for Matt Matt I'm curious I know you

726
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:50,599
travel quite a bit around the country

727
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:53,450
and get a chance to attend a lot of

728
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:56,179
cannabis conferences what would you say

729
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:58,759
is a level of lack of better word

730
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,490
cross-pollination between what we know

731
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:05,029
to be true in cannabis and what more

732
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:07,789
mature AG sector players are doing today

733
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:09,829
based on you know multiple years of

734
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:12,259
experience in greenhouse is there a

735
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:14,389
bigger need for that kind of cross

736
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:17,410
sector conversation are you seeing that

737
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,970
happen in other parts of the country

738
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,710
yeah a great great question John you

739
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,720
know I think over the last especially

740
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,059
four or five years as industry has kind

741
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,190
of rapidly grown and evolved you know

742
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:29,509
we've seen a lot of crossover or I like

743
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,539
the word cross-pollination a lot better

744
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:34,160
from from major AG over to to the

745
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:36,379
cannabis industry and vice versa you

746
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,269
know there's been a large amount of

747
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,440
monetary capital to come into the

748
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:41,779
cannabis industry that has really

749
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,610
invoked a lot of innovation that has

750
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:46,339
been stagnant in commercial lag for

751
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:49,279
years however that has also been an

752
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:51,859
Achilles heel of people trying to evolve

753
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,509
too quickly and forgetting some of the

754
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:56,000
simple standards

755
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:58,480
of large-scale agriculture as well so

756
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,680
that that's really where we've seen this

757
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,809
information pass that's been happening

758
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,529
and for the most part you know I think

759
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:10,970
that the scaling and the the large

760
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:15,950
industrial practices of Ag are starting

761
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:17,900
to be more accepted as cannabis gets to

762
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,880
the scale where those things make sense

763
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:23,150
you know for a long time we're at a

764
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,190
hobbyist or commercial scale where some

765
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,960
of those large-scale methodologies just

766
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,210
weren't applicable but now that that

767
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,269
we're really kind of breaching those

768
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:33,890
those those size and scale to that that

769
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:35,269
next level they're really starting to

770
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,590
become applicable and then combining

771
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:38,509
that with the innovation that starting

772
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:46,059
to happen we're really seeing this this

773
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:46,059
hot pot of explosive growth also

774
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,460
I've got to think about what I want how

775
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,080
I want to say this I don't want to

776
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,789
ostracize myself with a group of people

777
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:57,639
that are looking in you know directly at

778
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:59,399
cannabis or Tamera cos we have had

779
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,900
cannabis customers for the last decade

780
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,759
prior to that I ran a company called

781
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,870
Grodin which we had a large percentage

782
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,890
of our business was in the cannabis

783
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:11,739
market what I have watched over the last

784
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,600
five years is that I think they you know

785
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,279
they're there's always been a cannabis

786
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,619
as special and I we heard another

787
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,349
speakers say that earlier today and I

788
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:23,589
think is is as long as as soon as as an

789
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:25,629
industry we start to say we're in indoor

790
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:27,459
crop production or we're in controlled

791
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,000
environment agriculture regardless of

792
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,419
the plant

793
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,829
I think the industry itself will move

794
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:36,070
faster and find those cross pollinators

795
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:39,220
much quicker than if we keep setting

796
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:40,928
that crop aside you know I work the

797
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,298
first decade of my career I focused on

798
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:45,669
flora culture and in most flora culture

799
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:48,339
facilities in the United States growers

800
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:50,400
will grow between five and five hundred

801
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:52,899
varieties and a thousand varieties and

802
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,940
what we learn is that you know you might

803
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,500
have a bedding plant in the same

804
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,808
greenhouse that later that year you're

805
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,819
gonna have a point setup very different

806
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:02,889
crops very different ways to grow them

807
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:04,779
but they're both a plant that responds

808
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,340
to the same variables now how you

809
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,440
program your growing approach or your

810
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:09,579
cultivation strategy will change but

811
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,350
it's not going to change so drastically

812
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:13,659
that one plants different than the other

813
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:15,129
and that segment of the industry there

814
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,500
was no such thing as that point sedia

815
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:20,110
company or a geranium company there

816
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:23,289
would be a dream grower who grew other

817
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:25,058
crops but there wasn't this idea that it

818
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:27,308
was a crop that was special and then if

819
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:30,099
you look at big AG especially as we have

820
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:31,509
making its way in a big AG you know one

821
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:33,159
one year you're gonna have a strawberry

822
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:35,558
grower and next year he's gonna be a

823
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,090
hemp grower then if he sold his him at a

824
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:38,798
reasonable price he may be a hemp Brewer

825
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:39,970
again but if he didn't guess what he's

826
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,150
probably a blueberry grower the next

827
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:45,819
year because those crops are extremely

828
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,320
different but to change is just a matter

829
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:49,539
of changing or managing different

830
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:52,659
variables but they're the same variables

831
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:54,668
and and so I think once we get that

832
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,308
there will be growth in the industry

833
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:59,679
that that helps both sides both the food

834
00:31:57,308 --> 00:32:00,410
or animal ornamental producers as well

835
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,769
as the

836
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:06,800
miss growers I have one more question

837
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:08,480
based on that so we're seeing rapid

838
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,940
changes like Matt you talked about how

839
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,329
you changed a girl room into like a lab

840
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:18,019
space now how do people like utilities

841
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:20,059
like me or other other groups that are

842
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:22,220
working with this industry keep up with

843
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:23,990
that rapid change there's constant

844
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,089
consolidation there's constant new

845
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,970
technologies there's always new

846
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:30,829
customers being added and you could

847
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,980
argue that the new technologies cost

848
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:36,470
more and maybe should be rebated but how

849
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,509
do we keep up with what's happening so

850
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:41,120
quickly and make sure that we're not

851
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:43,879
let's say investing a bunch of money in

852
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:48,459
grow lights that may not be used as grow

853
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,460
lights in that space within like a year

854
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:52,909
well this is my opportunity for another

855
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:54,589
shameless plug for the resource

856
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,970
innovation Institute I think it's

857
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:57,529
through organizations like that we're

858
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,660
bringing together really smart

859
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:01,879
like-minded individuals to figure out

860
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,130
you know the base standards and compare

861
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,600
it in an objective way and I'm a real

862
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,640
big fan of proof is in the pudding you

863
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,980
know - so to actually see it being done

864
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,600
and then to be able to kind of compare

865
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,980
that with others who are doing similar

866
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:18,169
things to figure out the best way of

867
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:20,779
doing it I'm like this all I do every

868
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,580
day 24/7 and I still feel like it's hard

869
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,920
for me to keep up on it so I wouldn't

870
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:26,419
feel bad if you if you have those same

871
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,240
kind of apprehensions and I would just

872
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:31,550
look for those verified trusted sources

873
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:35,740
like these nonprofits like the ri-ight

874
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:35,740
for that validated information
