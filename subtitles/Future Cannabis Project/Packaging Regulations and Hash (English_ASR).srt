1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,669
the problem now I've been finding is all

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,960
the hash that nucleates and butters

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:13,320
because the childproof container is not

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,330
airtight yeah so but that's regulation

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,329
there's like three manufacturers and

6
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:28,320
since a busy where before but since I

7
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:31,679
have use new one now they are drilling

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,049
ranging linga and already I know people

9
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,719
are trying to edge my ash now it's like

10
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:39,449
if I have to put a single fan paper

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,870
around every glam AIO main there already

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:47,190
is like it's crazy to to do that I

13
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:50,099
catching the way I do it and I wanted to

14
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:53,789
do Signum but it looks like it's not

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:58,890
possible it's 1,000 1,000 1.2 but you'll

16
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:02,280
never know yeah so that's not even

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,849
option one one thing I think we really

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,599
need is to change the legislation on

19
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:12,269
like being able to buy 5 grams in one

20
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,250
container and the limit is 8 grams you

21
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:17,399
should be able to buy 8 grams in one

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,040
container of hash because that means I

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,740
had to package eight more boxes eight

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,290
more glossy because eight more plastic

25
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,569
things we're just created by ways you to

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,150
waste you produce and stuff you ask her

27
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:34,379
so much shit for every dollar a

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,390
manufacturer saves it it could mean a

29
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:39,060
difference on the retail shelf of three

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,079
dollars so if I don't have to package

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,659
that many times I can just even just

32
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,709
even ski time instead of one it's ski

33
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,710
time cheaper yeah exactly
