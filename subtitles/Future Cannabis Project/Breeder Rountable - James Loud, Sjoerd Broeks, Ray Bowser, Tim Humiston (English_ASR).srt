1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,809
and we are live on YouTube thank you for

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:09,120
joining us everyone today's breeder

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:11,820
roundtable is MC by James loud

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,798
that's me Peter severe a and I'm gonna

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,179
hand it off to James so James take it

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,519
away

7
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:20,850
so I guess start off by talking about

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,320
Bureau AIDS and viruses and pathogens I

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,868
feel like Joseph that's kind of his

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,920
expertise a lot of people have been kind

11
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:31,140
of wondering about hotplate especially I

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,579
feel like that's one of the more common

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,820
ones that people are having problems

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,090
with and have recently identified I know

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,500
we had Sour Diesel back in the day and

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,090
around 2003 the Sour Diesel cuts that

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,179
were going around had problems it was

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,489
like almost like something we really

19
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,399
couldn't identify but it was like a

20
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:55,320
Dedinje disease and now we're finding

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,410
out that a lot of those Sour Diesel kids

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,259
have hopped blatant and Joseph I guess

23
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:03,479
you can kind of fill everybody in on

24
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:07,140
your experience not only with pop Layton

25
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:10,408
but with genetics that are being made

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,710
and as far as through seed what

27
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,820
pathogens viruses and eurowings can be

28
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:19,259
transferred okay yeah so populating like

29
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:20,599
you said has been around for a really

30
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,969
long time

31
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:27,000
when it started really becoming I think

32
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:31,469
a more widespread problem I think in

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,450
California in like the mid 20 teams I

34
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:39,048
started working in cannabis tissue

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:42,930
culture in 2016 and basically are in

36
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:45,240
1617 this was when dark heart and other

37
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:56,100
companies were doing like early research

38
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:58,500
like humble seeds oh yeah or some silos

39
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,780
dark hearts a couple other companies

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,849
were all kind of plunging through what

41
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,280
was going on and they basically had to

42
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:07,769
do RNA sequencing which is basically

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,699
just like a sequencing technology where

44
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:13,769
you go looking for specific sequences of

45
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,409
and then they found hot waiting gearoids

46
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,320
this really common disease and hops on

47
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,870
the west coast of the United States that

48
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,269
presumably jumped over in cannabis

49
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:30,300
they're all can't officiated or related

50
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:34,650
plants and in eighteen or nineteen I

51
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,580
believe two pages were published by

52
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,110
filozov dark heart at the same time

53
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,560
positively identifying completing the

54
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:46,740
oeid and linking it to cutting disease

55
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,920
basically funded unfinished flower that

56
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,540
doesn't have normal contaminoid content

57
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:57,119
such accrued increased rooting and

58
00:02:53,539 --> 00:03:01,189
vegetative propagation and like really

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:06,960
weird modeling variegation of the leaves

60
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:10,109
the symptoms show up very differently in

61
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,810
different cannabis varieties and what's

62
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,810
real kicker about hot waiting period is

63
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,090
a lot of people as asymptomatic

64
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,819
infection so basically this thing

65
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:26,699
spreads around through unsanitized tools

66
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:29,909
and then some stress happens and then

67
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:32,250
flower starts to done so the biggest

68
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,889
thing that I preach nowadays everyone

69
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,819
that I talk to is tool sanitation and

70
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:41,729
this concept if you're sharing the same

71
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:44,639
scissors on plant it's just like sharing

72
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:49,909
needles and you transfer a lot of things

73
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,909
throughout a growing sanitized tools

74
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:59,879
interesting so so we have some mutual

75
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:01,620
friends that have had issues with hot

76
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,930
Leighton that had pretty much destroyed

77
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,450
their library or did a majority of their

78
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:10,050
library and then you're saying sometimes

79
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:11,819
it it basically expresses itself and

80
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,469
sometimes it doesn't so sometimes you

81
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,079
can test and you could have it but it's

82
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:19,168
not expressing itself right so I've been

83
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,000
doing PCR testing for hot lately roid

84
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:24,029
and other viruses for the last year and

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,230
a half out of my lab partying

86
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:31,559
based in Berkeley and Pauline Durrett is

87
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:34,290
the most common thing that we find why I

88
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,220
can't talk about people's results but I

89
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:40,790
thought because oddly in theory it is so

90
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:45,750
common it's aroused in multiple states

91
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:48,510
and it's all over the country so it's an

92
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,110
industry-wide issue and like you'd ask

93
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:57,240
valleys it's deep transmittable we don't

94
00:04:52,110 --> 00:05:00,900
know exactly the rate of how many what

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,449
the percentage rate of if an infected

96
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:06,269
plant from a bright seed how much

97
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:08,939
percentage of that seed is infected in

98
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:13,918
hops itself at that percentage is

99
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:15,990
something around 8% so the thing that

100
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,359
people always want to ask is okay what

101
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,500
do I have on my pocket or if I'm here to

102
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,900
caching it what do I do

103
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,970
the most important thing like I said is

104
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:27,389
tool sanitation you want to prevent

105
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,430
spreading of diseases in your own um the

106
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,800
second most important thing is if you

107
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,490
have symptomatic clamps and you can

108
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,350
afford it

109
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,819
get rid of them because they're only

110
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:40,439
going to cause you problems down the

111
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:43,439
line as for like you said James people

112
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:46,050
that have it how I gotta grow that had

113
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,969
it I had to tear down all the genetics

114
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,189
answer from scratch working with

115
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,470
companies that are actively testing for

116
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:55,430
it doing your own independent

117
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:59,460
third-party testing of your own plants

118
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:02,639
is the best way to basically source of

119
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,109
new genetic and for farm preferably from

120
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,610
like digital did you close your

121
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,699
background or source and then start it

122
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,800
clean and keep it clean so now how about

123
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,409
tissue coats are conditioned culture in

124
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:22,079
your opinion remove the half latent

125
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:23,939
virus from the culture different

126
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,609
companies have different techniques they

127
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,469
do just three treatments different but

128
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,930
everyone fundamentally goes through this

129
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:34,620
meristem tissue culture process where

130
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,840
you dissect a microscopic stem stem cell

131
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,329
niche out of the impacts that are

132
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,758
growing

133
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:43,508
plant and you regrow a couple hundred

134
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:47,080
cells in swinging flame and you test

135
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:50,259
those plant lit and issue culture and um

136
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:52,318
it's I've done this for years several

137
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:55,780
companies have been doing this for years

138
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,889
successfully it's a pain in the ass it

139
00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:01,538
takes a long time sometimes you have to

140
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:05,530
successively do it because the first

141
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:07,860
half did it eradicated yeah

142
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:10,359
it's truly a fixable problem but I

143
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,788
always talk to people about if you want

144
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,520
to invest in tissue culture remediation

145
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:18,759
you got to make sure that you don't push

146
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:21,810
back in a bad situation I think a lot of

147
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:25,090
people I think a lot of growers

148
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,879
basically I've seen all sorts of tools

149
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:31,119
sanitation protocols from great to poor

150
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,218
and I think everyone can always be

151
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,158
constantly working on improving

152
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:39,069
sanitation and preventing spread of

153
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:41,800
disease and their growth yeah I think

154
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:43,689
that's just a given for sure it's you

155
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,490
know nobody's perfect and it has to be

156
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:49,019
an ongoing constant thing I mean yeah

157
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:52,689
and like quarantine a concept like

158
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:54,250
quarantined isolated blocks I mean I

159
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:57,098
think a lot of people are going to move

160
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,629
away from like well your vegetative

161
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:00,668
population at least if you're keeping

162
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:10,960
mobs on-site you want to kind of keep

163
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:12,698
things compartmentalized right well so I

164
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,408
think Tim is on the line you guys have

165
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,180
any experience with hot Layton they're

166
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:18,189
having to deal with viruses and bureaus

167
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,829
I know you guys are like a real farm up

168
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:22,000
there in Washington and you guys were as

169
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:24,490
farm as it gets

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,579
and you guys have clean plants and clean

171
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,460
medicine so yeah you know we actually

172
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:33,009
just sit around a test with Joe not that

173
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:35,948
long ago and we actually had to pop up

174
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:38,229
and you know luckily we we do already

175
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,908
segment segregate everything we use

176
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,940
separate scissors and everything so it's

177
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:44,559
a pretty easy fix for us the thing that

178
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,130
caught us off guard you know we sent in

179
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,719
a couple cultivars that we thought at it

180
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,929
and then we send in a couple that we

181
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,509
thought for sure weren't

182
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:55,789
displaying anything and at the end of

183
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:57,139
the day kind of kind of fooled us you

184
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:57,799
know one of the ones we thought had it

185
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,019
for sure

186
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,490
ended up test and clean not to say it

187
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:03,949
doesn't have it you know but it wasn't

188
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,990
found on the first test and then one of

189
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,330
our one said we haven't had any issues

190
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,950
with wouldn't think we had it and it

191
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,970
actually popped up you know but we keep

192
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,870
things in a pretty stress-free

193
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:18,290
environment and you know so a lot of

194
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,060
them stay asymptomatic but you know

195
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:21,230
luckily no we haven't had too much you

196
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,019
know I think this is just something

197
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,920
newer that came in on us we brought in

198
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:30,139
and I hope we've dealt with it we'll

199
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,649
find out here we're gonna do some more

200
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:35,569
testing to make sure yeah it's a huge

201
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,159
thing I mean I think it's something that

202
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,450
should be on everyone's radar and I

203
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,350
think there's a lot of people that are

204
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:44,330
just ignoring it but yeah I mean as long

205
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,100
as you're clean you guys are fairly

206
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,360
clean with your practices I mean you

207
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,659
guys have dirt on the ground but you

208
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,700
guys are farming it were you doing you

209
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:54,139
guys are real farmers which you know

210
00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:00,528
that's one thing I love about your farm

211
00:09:54,139 --> 00:10:02,870
too so yes as far as I guess we can kind

212
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:06,769
of like move on to talking about some of

213
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:11,360
the other stuff with Claudio silver

214
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:39,588
reversing plants oh it looks like swords

215
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:41,120
in good night fully organic yes the

216
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,390
swords been working with feminized seeds

217
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:49,578
for with twenty years more than twenty

218
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:54,399
years 25 years right really actively I

219
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:54,399
mean as working with the flying dutchman

220
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:11,779
kind of like the culture a little bit in

221
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:17,629
the beginning advances it's gotten a lot

222
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:20,449
more consistent I think once once you

223
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:21,710
get over the learning processes like

224
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,280
with reading you've got to know which

225
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:33,230
appellant owners do all with which

226
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:35,949
lecture yeah I think definitely it's

227
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,950
come a long ways

228
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:40,129
the selection process understanding the

229
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:42,649
plants all that's come a long ways and I

230
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:45,889
think even like with what Tim's doing

231
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:48,620
with colloidal silver that we've kind of

232
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:51,319
been working on we plan to release some

233
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,929
stuff here in the not so distant future

234
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:58,070
but Tim can kind of touch base on the

235
00:11:53,929 --> 00:12:02,239
nanotechnology one milliliter to one

236
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:04,129
gallon silver as opposed to the

237
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:11,990
colloidal silver that we we made in

238
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:14,899
concentration back today which I think

239
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:20,509
was commonly used mostly in Europe along

240
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:23,870
with Caligula silver yeah I can touch on

241
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:25,309
that a little bit you know so it's

242
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,690
probably been about a decade that I've

243
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:29,059
been working to try to kind of get away

244
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,060
from the osts and some of these other

245
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:35,000
things and it started with reworking

246
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:37,519
Claudio silver most of what's on the

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,559
market advertises colloidal silver

248
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,980
actually isn't a cordial at all it's an

249
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:45,769
ionic silver which tends at problems

250
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,379
when it's you know kind of going through

251
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:50,059
the plan it'll it'll bond to other

252
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:53,539
molecules and kind of fall out of

253
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:56,329
suspension and so the old silver is

254
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:59,089
always kind of got a bad name so you

255
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:01,700
know while back started to take a deep

256
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:04,220
look at that and really learn what a

257
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,379
true colloidal is and then how to

258
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,889
produce it and a really consistent basis

259
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:11,600
and getting nano particles and so I'm

260
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,220
actually coming up in James's book here

261
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,840
at some point there's a chapter in there

262
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,759
that goes over gives specific

263
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,509
instructions on how to actually make a

264
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,059
really effect

265
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:23,360
of colloidal silver that that you know

266
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:24,529
works as good if not better than STS but

267
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,830
now we've kind of taken it to the next

268
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:31,179
step in that research I found out some

269
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:33,920
other things and now we have a true a

270
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:35,509
nanoparticles silver that we that I'm

271
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,269
producing and that we're gonna be

272
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,590
launching here soon and this one's

273
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:42,740
actually really exciting for me you know

274
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,210
it's about just as safe as Clothilde

275
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,519
silver you know no silver is totally

276
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,960
safe but how to save this colonial

277
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,149
silver but we've gone into a

278
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,019
concentration plank where you're mixed

279
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:56,449
in one mill to one gallon and it's

280
00:13:54,019 --> 00:14:00,529
discretion the game that's it's exciting

281
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:03,020
for us to something new something safer

282
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:06,309
or something simple one part you know no

283
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:11,090
mixing and it's stable table you can

284
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:13,219
well like you mix it with well water you

285
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,590
can you know use the spray day after day

286
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,259
you don't have to start over fresh no

287
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:20,470
keep itself in refrigerators you don't

288
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:23,500
want it too much in the the light

289
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:26,420
overdoing it with sort of UV light or

290
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,659
anything of that nature but as long as

291
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:30,889
you can pretty much keep it generally

292
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,809
out of the light

293
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:35,600
this stuff's stable and it will just

294
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:37,219
keep on rockin yeah I've honestly never

295
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,710
seen anything like it it's just so

296
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,580
simple I mean with STS there are several

297
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:45,560
steps involved with with making it with

298
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,060
the traditional collodial silver unless

299
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:49,339
you're making it yourself it's really

300
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,799
its hit or miss and it's probably not

301
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,259
the smartest thing to do I mean I think

302
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:56,389
it's just the simple solution moving

303
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:58,700
forward and colloidal silver is just so

304
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:00,549
much safer than silver thiosulfate for

305
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,350
people to be handling as far as plants

306
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:05,120
if you process your plants you know

307
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,420
post-harvest after you've harvested your

308
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,710
seeds if you do any sort of you know you

309
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,079
don't want you don't want silver

310
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,360
thiosulfate in there where's Claudia

311
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:18,200
silver at those concentrations and not

312
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,909
dangerous no not at all I mean the worst

313
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,379
comes to where's your killing like some

314
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:23,500
of the micro life on your skin and

315
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:26,240
obviously want to keep that around so

316
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,070
you know I still recommend you know

317
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,950
proper protective wear and everything

318
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:35,450
but um you know it's drinking so I don't

319
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:49,100
I feel pretty good have you become

320
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:52,850
feminized gonna mention the only way to

321
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,950
do it yep yeah so we're excited about

322
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,540
this product really can't wait to get it

323
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,670
out on the market and you get in some

324
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:03,589
more people's hands it's a real

325
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:20,120
game-changer yeah it's pretty amazing

326
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:22,460
stuff yeah definitely whoo definitely

327
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,820
get some in your hands there get your

328
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:29,060
opinion on it yeah I've been making

329
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:32,090
seeds in a spot up north where I we used

330
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:35,109
Tim's spray and I learned a valuable

331
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,700
lesson on doing large-scale production I

332
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,940
decided I was going to spray my donors

333
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,070
in the field and you can you can totally

334
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,440
do that there's you know it's requires a

335
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:48,140
lot more labor but Tim when he was up

336
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,570
helping out he suggested that and it's

337
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:52,720
just a game changer is that you take all

338
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,790
your males and you put them in one place

339
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,250
spray them bring them out in the field

340
00:16:55,789 --> 00:17:00,259
that way you're not taking up your roast

341
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,539
your space racing your rows with your

342
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:04,750
donors you can have them pollinate your

343
00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:06,649
receivers and then pull them out

344
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,940
especially with something like we're

345
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,610
using tech line where you can actually

346
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,529
take emitters put the emitters onto the

347
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,299
tech line into the pots right off your

348
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:19,059
tech line that's providing water for

349
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:21,680
your other plants you know game changers

350
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:24,859
when you experience scaling man it's

351
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,078
like it's a whole new world yeah that's

352
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:33,529
an understatement

353
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:35,720
yeah yeah I think you're able to spray

354
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:37,899
them more evenly you know you're not

355
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,000
walking step so it takes a lot less

356
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,250
labour to do it that way and you can

357
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,740
control the donors a little bit more

358
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,990
yeah overspraying ministry big time if

359
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,410
you don't contain your spray suddenly

360
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:57,809
you're flipping everything yeah making

361
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:59,730
all kinds of weird seeds so yeah well

362
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:02,490
then we're doing some of the stuff I'm

363
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,349
doing up there it's like yeah it's it's

364
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,940
been a real learning experience I can't

365
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,709
wait till next year actually and like

366
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,100
I'm only halfway through this year and

367
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:13,319
I'm like I can't wait till next year but

368
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:13,740
yeah that's farming so that's kind of

369
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,450
how it goes

370
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,480
so I guess I didn't really do

371
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,100
introductions for everybody but now that

372
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,099
Odie's here we can kind of go around and

373
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:25,199
talk about ourselves for a second but

374
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:27,089
yeah my name is James lab do you guys

375
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,940
may or may not know me but I have a book

376
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:31,500
called cannabis breeding beginner to

377
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,120
advanced techniques and that should be

378
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,690
out relatively soon I think it's

379
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:39,389
available for pre-order on Amazon still

380
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:42,750
EDD Rosenthal's publishing company is

381
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,340
publishing it the Tim is in the book we

382
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,759
have some stuff from short in the book

383
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,949
Joseph is in the book as well and OD has

384
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,660
been helping me with some seed projects

385
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:56,279
so some of his stuff and photos are

386
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:58,470
gonna be in the book as well so yeah Tim

387
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:03,119
Tim you want to talk about a little bit

388
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,500
what you do and your I'll talk about Tim

389
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,679
for a second here actually because I

390
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,779
feel like he's the Einstein of cannabis

391
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:13,710
he always comes up with crazy original

392
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:16,589
ideas and concepts you know for instance

393
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,329
like spraying that your sprayer is

394
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:22,049
amazing he's a pollen sprayer he gave me

395
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:24,179
the idea of by using it it's not a here

396
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:26,369
you little airbrush works good but then

397
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,049
you can do if you want to go field you

398
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:31,379
can actually get a sandblaster and

399
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:34,919
convert the sandblaster it's pretty

400
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,480
pretty amazing stuff yeah all that no

401
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,340
you know if you're just doing small

402
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,799
rooms you know one thing that we started

403
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:42,709
doing a while back was using exactly

404
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:47,490
what James has there's a little

405
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:49,110
airbrushing yeah handheld airbrush you

406
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,640
can put your pollen in the top as long

407
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:53,490
as this is top loading you can put your

408
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,610
pollen in there I blend my pollen with

409
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,589
rice flour so

410
00:19:55,609 --> 00:20:00,439
works extra good as long as it's a dry

411
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:02,209
you works great long as everything's dry

412
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,509
and it's not humid it works great for

413
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:12,529
site pollination is that something you

414
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:14,359
can pick up on like Amazon or Ebay it

415
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:17,539
works great this is battery operated it

416
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:20,000
doesn't have a cord it's real simple you

417
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:22,159
want to clean it up good between pollen

418
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,029
but you know water neutralizes pollen as

419
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,370
well so and what's it called this is a

420
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:32,379
hand I think this is a makeup airbrush

421
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:32,379
gun yep exactly

422
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:37,219
yeah they got him for like spreading

423
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,229
mineral makeup or applying mineral

424
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:43,039
makeup you know where it is a powder

425
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:44,808
actually and I mean it's it's pretty

426
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,750
much the same application just different

427
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:50,450
powdered yeah well then this is the

428
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,240
traditional so you guys can see here

429
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,490
this is more of the traditional power

430
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,069
sprayer this is like for for dusting

431
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,808
roses a plant duster you it requires a

432
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:04,879
lot of fallin for this thing to work

433
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:09,470
effectively it does work farmers use

434
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:13,040
this stuff out in the field and but this

435
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:16,339
is way more advanced simple it

436
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,109
definitely targets it better yeah we'll

437
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:19,789
say if you want to go bigger and you're

438
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:21,019
gonna have to use an air compressor or

439
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:23,240
something you gotta be really careful

440
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:25,190
that you're not getting anything with

441
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,589
moisture you know will actually use

442
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,330
compressed gas either compressed co2 or

443
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:31,668
compressed nitrogen because both of

444
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,899
those are pretty dry but if you say you

445
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:34,220
just hook it up to a normal air

446
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,690
compressor you get yourself in trouble

447
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,480
because that's gonna start spitting out

448
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:41,720
some moisture no one thing to really

449
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,179
think about depending on what scale

450
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,370
you're taking it to yeah and basically

451
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:49,370
moisture reverses the magnetism on the

452
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:53,389
pollen and then becomes you know it

453
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:56,569
doesn't work so I've experienced that

454
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,919
for sure you were telling me you met

455
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:02,750
with some guys that we're actually

456
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:05,840
applying it and with water what does

457
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,549
that turn out to be true I have been

458
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,289
followed up more on that but yeah that's

459
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:12,230
what we're saying that there

460
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:15,619
with water and it's like okay well you

461
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:18,009
know maybe someone has something new I'd

462
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:20,389
be scared you see your big try

463
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:22,039
especially with the volume cuz you guys

464
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,980
are like the hep stuff that you guys are

465
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:26,599
doing down south is like you screw up a

466
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,460
couple acres man that's that's a lot of

467
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:36,679
money yeah especially with the hep

468
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:38,750
prices these days so yeah so Tim you

469
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,720
want to talk about your hamper canto

470
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,539
organics a little bit sure I could I

471
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,509
could just touch them both so yeah we

472
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:52,119
have Ken organics up here in Washington

473
00:22:46,509 --> 00:22:54,140
just 30,000 square foot canopy grow

474
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,879
having a lot of fun with it you know

475
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,530
when in a lot of awards just kind of

476
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,580
staying at the top of our game up here

477
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:04,220
we got five six dope cups a couple high

478
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:06,049
times got voted best greenhouse

479
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,319
production a couple years in a row up

480
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:12,559
here so that's that's a lot of fun and

481
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:15,859
then down south we have another company

482
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:20,089
me and a few other three other friends

483
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:22,219
you know how pound it and that is pretty

484
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:24,740
much a contractor for HGH so we're

485
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,990
producing feminized hemp seeds on on

486
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,230
really large scale down there I'm

487
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:33,109
probably larger than I've seen done

488
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,849
before and that's going pretty well

489
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:36,319
we're definitely there's some humps and

490
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:38,719
bumps in the road there's a learning

491
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:42,619
process there once you scale up to you

492
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,940
know acres wise and but yeah that's

493
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:47,839
going great too

494
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:52,250
definitely a learning process but we're

495
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:54,679
picking it up pretty quick no that's the

496
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,539
beauty of it we are literally out in the

497
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,299
middle of nowhere you know we did that

498
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:01,399
intentionally getting out really hilly

499
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:04,159
area somewhere that can never be farmed

500
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,780
with tractors and stuff like that so

501
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,540
we've kind of gotten ourselves in an

502
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:11,000
area where you know large-scale hints

503
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:14,089
just not gonna happen around us it's

504
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,980
awesome pretty ideal for what we're

505
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:22,970
doing awesome so yeah and then sword

506
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:25,380
I've known sword for quite a while

507
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:28,799
no no short for quite a while we've been

508
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,030
friends for the last couple years we've

509
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,950
been on a bunch of panels

510
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:37,950
I think Tim and I in short have been on

511
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:41,759
panels together Joseph as well and short

512
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,259
has a Dutch consulting company and he's

513
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:46,859
got one of the biggest libraries of

514
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,329
checks out of anybody that I know and he

515
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:53,099
runs some of the biggest greenhouse

516
00:24:48,329 --> 00:25:00,210
facilities in the world anything else

517
00:24:53,099 --> 00:25:02,129
you want to touch on they're short we

518
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,630
had a question come up from one of the

519
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:08,700
viewers about putting a mail a donor

520
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:11,490
into with the with the receivers now I

521
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,980
think we want to touch on that as far as

522
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,170
a cut it can kind of be a group question

523
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:19,710
OB you can kind of get in on this Tim

524
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:22,800
and short as well what as far as ratios

525
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:26,150
if you're doing rag seeds I feel like

526
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,980
nobody could probably answer that or

527
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,259
even better or even back it up and just

528
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,660
like start with males in general like

529
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:35,549
you know your process of selecting males

530
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,320
and then into this part of the question

531
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:42,109
which would be kind of like bringing

532
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:42,109
them into putting them out to stud

533
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:51,269
redundancy that I'm sure you've heard

534
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:54,930
from other people you're also looking

535
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:57,389
for structure and other things but the

536
00:25:54,930 --> 00:26:01,830
old-school way I mean we can test stuff

537
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:03,030
now we can reverse males into females

538
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:06,689
there's all kinds of interesting things

539
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:08,160
you can do as far as testing wise but

540
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,990
the old-school way is I always rubbing

541
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,130
that stem again you good smell already

542
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:15,660
and also just breeding with it and

543
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,840
seeing what comes out and then if it

544
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,880
doesn't come out good but I think a lot

545
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:22,409
of good breeders use the same males over

546
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,410
and over a lot of good readers save

547
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:29,509
their meals I have a tendency to lose my

548
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:32,009
males but I've saved some over the years

549
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:34,329
I've saved some for seasons I've saved

550
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:36,220
some for a couple years

551
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:38,889
but it's it's tough keeping me alive

552
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:43,298
also requires a decent size nursery now

553
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:45,038
as far as you only need a small amount

554
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:49,418
of males compared to females now that

555
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:52,359
just depends on the room size od what is

556
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:56,470
your ratio that you would use for male

557
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:58,750
to female donor two receivers the one

558
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:02,230
date is what you're seeing Augie yeah

559
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:05,288
one day one male to females usually

560
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:07,480
where I like to be we we laughter we do

561
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:10,419
about three days with the pollinating I

562
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,429
don't do it a large window pollen flying

563
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:14,919
that way everything's kind of done

564
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:19,179
pretty much at the same time so yeah you

565
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:21,730
know right about that also dependent

566
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:24,820
upon the size of females right right

567
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:27,519
totally so yeah and just a little

568
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:28,148
touching on Odie here he he's an old

569
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,169
school breeder

570
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:34,569
he started with TGA with sub and and

571
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:37,690
Shane and and jinx and all those guys

572
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:41,138
over there and he's an outdoor breeder

573
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:44,679
and so his experience but greeting is

574
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:47,048
definitely outdoor regular seed yeah he

575
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:52,090
created the doctor who he's done a lot

576
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:54,369
of amazing work over the years so yeah

577
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:56,048
big seeds he makes big-ass seeds I mean

578
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:59,678
his seeds are significantly bigger than

579
00:27:56,048 --> 00:28:01,359
the seeds that I make indoors you know

580
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,019
just just looking right out and you'll

581
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,308
see you'll notice that from outdoor

582
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:08,259
breeders to indoor breeders the guys

583
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:11,308
that are using the HPS their seeds are

584
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:14,440
typically a lot smaller I've had gotchas

585
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:16,388
seed where I did the same cross indoors

586
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,278
and outdoors and then ended up with

587
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:22,178
bigger seed outdoors from the same exact

588
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:24,269
cross so Tim what about you

589
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:26,970
as far as for him

590
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:29,849
how generally it's like a one two six

591
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:33,089
one two six so yours is even more

592
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:35,490
concentrate just do you feel like you

593
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:37,009
you get more seeds by using one to six

594
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:42,029
as opposed to something like one to nine

595
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:46,558
is that you guys have tested you know

596
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:48,359
this is just more I call overdoing it

597
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:53,730
let's just overdo it make sure we got

598
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:56,459
enough right and then short what's

599
00:28:53,730 --> 00:29:09,839
what's your experience with donor to

600
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:11,579
receiving ratios what like with regular

601
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,279
breeding indoors you can make hundreds

602
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:18,589
of thousands of seeds with one now in my

603
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:21,269
experience accidentally seating rooms

604
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:24,659
yeah it's interesting my typical ratio

605
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:28,019
for idea one to twelve with regular

606
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:32,820
rating and I do one to 9 with feminized

607
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:36,089
if I'm not experienced with it so yeah

608
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:37,950
it's really interesting on the donors as

609
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:39,539
far as like if you have tested donors

610
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,250
it's so much easier to you know what the

611
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:44,730
donors gonna do I think a lot of ringers

612
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,200
out there just breed with whatever and

613
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:50,519
don't have a lot of experience testing

614
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,259
and stuff and that you know you reflects

615
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,089
in the industry by the stability a lot

616
00:29:52,259 --> 00:30:01,109
of this of the genetics getting pumped

617
00:29:54,089 --> 00:30:03,899
out so and I see the future as companies

618
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:05,719
you know advance that we're gonna have a

619
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:10,140
lot more stable genetics I mean I think

620
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,779
it used to be what 1% mail was okay now

621
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,790
if you're talking about a sort of

622
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:17,190
company that does old seed sales you

623
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:19,139
want to have like that one in a thousand

624
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,570
or one in two thousand or one in five

625
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:27,240
thousand that can be achieved over time

626
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:28,950
by doing selective breeding so and I

627
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,750
think the Dutch stuff man back in the

628
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,120
day some of it was like you called

629
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,759
feminized C but it was like 5% nails

630
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,839
sometimes or 5% male and then some of

631
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,460
the stuff her

632
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:46,359
and even even today some of that stuff

633
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:50,440
is like that as far as do you have a

634
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:52,569
preferred climate or you prefer Oregon

635
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:57,100
or California you're mostly west coast

636
00:30:52,569 --> 00:31:00,519
now so since I moved to Oregon I kind of

637
00:30:57,099 --> 00:31:04,179
started doing more breeding indoors just

638
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:07,049
because of humidity factors pomerode Oh

639
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:10,660
outdoors is good and easy to super dry

640
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:12,339
super dry super dry don't have the

641
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,230
corneas kind of in the middle there's

642
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:15,759
Washington that's super wet where Tim's

643
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,980
that there's California which I feel is

644
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,420
perfect and then Colorado is great from

645
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,460
breeding in the sense that it's dry but

646
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,860
it also the pollen fucking travels all

647
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,480
over the place so you can have pollen

648
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:29,558
traveling miles from some Hempfield

649
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:33,009
pollinating your stuff yeah that's very

650
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:35,259
very true so yeah you know just depends

651
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:38,440
on we're doing we're we're doing the

652
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:41,049
breeding at is you know preferred method

653
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:45,039
obviously what do we feel gonna do

654
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:51,940
better but you know yeah a dry warm

655
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:55,000
climate is preferred for sure Tim do you

656
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,980
guys do any redundancy for your stuff as

657
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,319
far as for your part you you apply

658
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,808
pollen in the field that you've gathered

659
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:05,439
or do you just go direct with your

660
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:08,308
receiver donors a little bit of both you

661
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,650
know because well let's take the donors

662
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:13,990
after they release the you know the

663
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,910
majority of their pollen or you know

664
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,259
that however much we want to release and

665
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,308
will actually take those dry them out

666
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:20,799
collect the pollen

667
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:24,099
I'm just humble I'm gonna you know I'm

668
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,799
pretty much a tumbler they'd use for

669
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:29,439
like collecting Keith and then batch

670
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,389
that and then we'll use that on the next

671
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,480
round you know just gonna nice always

672
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:37,000
have a backup supply you know as much as

673
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,380
we much as I want to say everything goes

674
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,450
perfect every time you know you get

675
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,980
those flips or it just doesn't work as

676
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,779
good as you wanted it to so it's nice to

677
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:48,480
go to pull up hauling out of the

678
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:48,480
cupboard and get the job done

679
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:54,360
short your experience you guys collect

680
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:59,280
pollen as well and then apply it along

681
00:32:54,359 --> 00:33:35,909
with as a redundancy or do you prefer

682
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:39,660
just as far as you guys preserving

683
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:43,019
pollen what are your thoughts on

684
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:44,820
preserving pollen and long term you know

685
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,480
I I personally I blend it with rice

686
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:47,490
flour

687
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,110
I feel like rice flour is typically

688
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:53,069
finer than your traditional although you

689
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:56,009
can get fine wheat flour I blend it and

690
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:58,379
I do 50/50 although I hear some people

691
00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:01,019
do more and I can hear some people do

692
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,550
less freezing pollen works but I feel

693
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:05,609
like keeping the pollen dry is the

694
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:16,320
single most important thing what what

695
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:20,190
are your thoughts on that short Tim do

696
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,910
you preserve pollen long term and how do

697
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:27,179
you preserve it got a serious library of

698
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:30,210
pollen yeah I definitely do you know so

699
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:32,250
the hemp sides one thing but on the THC

700
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:35,010
realm

701
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,840
you know I in that realm I pretty much

702
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,210
specifically just collect pollen and

703
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,450
then apply it you know I don't do too

704
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,760
much open pollination in that realm and

705
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:46,259
I like store and pollen

706
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,570
keeping it around you know for those

707
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,910
future endeavors so primarily with that

708
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,100
you know I'm store it in a jar put in

709
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:55,079
the silica packet to build absorb any

710
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,759
moisture and then typically what we're

711
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:00,029
doing is we're back flushing with some

712
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,270
nitrogen getting all the oxygen out of

713
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,010
there

714
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:05,759
the general you know atmosphere out of

715
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:07,290
there and then get in the freezer and I

716
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,150
just store a long term in there you know

717
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:10,679
the real thing the real danger that you

718
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,059
have stored in the freezer is a lot of

719
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:16,319
people will pull it out of the freezer

720
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:18,119
and pop it open and it's cold and you

721
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,789
know there's humidity in the air and

722
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:24,599
that that moisture in the air condenses

723
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:26,519
on the cold pollen so biggest thing you

724
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,019
know probably biggest tip I can give is

725
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,030
if you're freezing it like that you want

726
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:31,949
to get it out let it get to room

727
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,850
temperature before you even open it up

728
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:37,289
and start messing with it at all yeah

729
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:42,839
plastic in not glass I feel like that's

730
00:35:37,289 --> 00:35:44,489
another one plastic yeah yeah the static

731
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,870
can be an issue with plastic at times

732
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:50,189
I've had some trying to get pollen out

733
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:52,409
of plastic where I just have a little

734
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,929
bit left and uh it's just stuck to the

735
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:58,349
side right scraping off it sticks to the

736
00:35:54,929 --> 00:36:01,619
other side and my palmera stuff and you

737
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:10,199
know butts into a plastic pile and just

738
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:11,549
a fall so do males Express do we have a

739
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,469
question dude males expressed

740
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:17,640
differently in the presence of females I

741
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:26,069
would say we're still talking about

742
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:32,730
plants here what what's your take on

743
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:34,760
that I can't say I've noticed that you

744
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:37,679
know but I've never been looking I guess

745
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:41,780
yeah

746
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:44,159
Odie I've never noticed a difference

747
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:46,890
although when you do have a male around

748
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,629
females seem to get seem to produce more

749
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:51,329
resin I don't know if that's just for

750
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:53,610
trying to catch more pollen or what but

751
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:56,849
I've never really noticed that am L

752
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:58,590
looking different what cuz you know it's

753
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,779
good to run your mouth full term before

754
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,010
you introduce them to anything so you

755
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,510
can make sure that it's got the

756
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:06,690
structures that you're wanting to pass

757
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:09,960
along but I've never noticed them really

758
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:12,510
to look different than being in a room

759
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,608
with the room full of females

760
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,470
yeah and I mean I've seen females

761
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:20,069
definitely grow more vigorously around

762
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:23,459
males and males you know I feel like

763
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:24,930
they I don't know that they express

764
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,250
themselves differently especially if

765
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:27,750
you're talking about a terpene or

766
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:36,420
structure or anything like that

767
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:38,579
but a interesting question yeah we need

768
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,159
to check out so there was also a

769
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:42,869
question about separating males and

770
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:46,230
females collecting pollen and then

771
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:50,750
applying rather than introducing the

772
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:54,420
male and female or donor receiver and

773
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:56,820
you can do both I feel like having the

774
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,880
plant side by side is more effective the

775
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,190
pollen is magnetic and it will go from

776
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,920
the female direct pollination where

777
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,389
you're applying Collin I think there's

778
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,300
some breeders that are super successful

779
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:10,739
like Cantor Otto

780
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:14,570
Kevin's freshman I think he does a lot

781
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:19,019
of collecting pollen and employment I

782
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:20,609
prefer having redundancy so I like both

783
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:22,530
where you actually have your male and

784
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:26,639
female and then if you need the problem

785
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:29,010
you have it there's just so many

786
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,289
different ways to do it and and there's

787
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:36,869
no right or wrong way in that sense if

788
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:39,300
you're getting seeds I will say you know

789
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:40,890
it does seem that when you have a male

790
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,250
in the room within your letting it fly

791
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:47,400
directly off the male that you get a

792
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:49,619
better you get a better set flying

793
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,139
pollen you know until the airbrush thing

794
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:59,070
came along you know applying Paul and

795
00:38:52,139 --> 00:39:01,019
really yeah mornings in itself you know

796
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,960
suddenly next thing you know you're like

797
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:06,119
you know you put enough pollen for the

798
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,240
whole room on one bud trying to reapply

799
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:11,250
it if you can just let it fly natural

800
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,639
you're gonna have a better you're gonna

801
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:16,559
have a better set yeah I remember people

802
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,379
back in the day taking like mason jars

803
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,059
of pollen and a fan and and dusting

804
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,800
behind the fan where is blowing the

805
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,420
whole room for the pollen

806
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,060
not the most effective way it's

807
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:30,150
definitely interesting we used to take

808
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:31,619
our fingers me and my partner Luke we'd

809
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,900
take our fingers and dip it in the

810
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,449
little pollen jar brush it on and then

811
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,639
we had multiple types of pollen we link

812
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:39,949
our fingers between the pollen and dry

813
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:44,279
them off

814
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:47,489
old-school hippie style and that works

815
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,060
but it's not as effective for sure yeah

816
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:52,500
the good old fashioned paintbrush flick

817
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:54,150
yeah I'm fairly effective you know

818
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,190
you'll see guys actually painting it on

819
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:57,570
with the paintbrush not realizing

820
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,630
they're getting resin glands all over

821
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:02,039
the paintbrush and the next is you gotta

822
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:05,390
flick it you're not gonna flick the

823
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:10,019
paintbrush and that method still works

824
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:12,449
yeah kinda so I guess another great

825
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:16,500
question how how many seeds do you get

826
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:18,210
per plant and then I think that's just

827
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:23,820
it varies so much on the size of the

828
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:26,070
female plant you know calyx is timing is

829
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,320
huge on that one just due to the fact of

830
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:29,820
if you do it too early you don't get

831
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:35,400
that many seeds and if you do it too

832
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:37,440
late they're all deformed yeah yeah it's

833
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,530
hitting that pollination the window is

834
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,909
important getting it in you know and

835
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,280
everybody has a different take on that

836
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:46,319
too like you keep on it on week three

837
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,750
and a half week for week four and a half

838
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,280
anywhere in there works you can

839
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,889
pollinate later but the thing is is your

840
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,620
plants the later you go the litter you

841
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:59,369
have to go to finish all the seeds

842
00:40:54,619 --> 00:41:02,339
mm-hmm so but yeah I mean it's it's a

843
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:05,609
tough thing averaging you know indoors

844
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:08,789
I've averaged 2,000 to 3,000 seeds per

845
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:11,340
plant on a good pollination and on a bad

846
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:16,170
one I've gotten you know mix and match

847
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:17,340
500 per plant and auto flowers 2004

848
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,309
plant that's a great number if you're

849
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:23,579
hitting 2,000 seeds per plant on auto

850
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:27,269
flower you're doing great auto flowers

851
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:28,199
typically are smaller but uh you know

852
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:31,980
those kind of numbers are good

853
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:33,779
especially if you have 500 plants yeah

854
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,059
things a lot easier to quantify it on

855
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:41,849
like a per square foot basis

856
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:44,390
canapé yeah sighs you know plants can be

857
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:47,609
take up three square feet they can take

858
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:52,528
60 square feet yeah you got nine

859
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:54,028
Skittles plants per square foot and hey

860
00:41:52,528 --> 00:41:55,679
you know any skittles is definitely one

861
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:57,059
of my favorite plants and it's not with

862
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,669
the structure it's for the terpene

863
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:03,660
profile which I think we can kind of

864
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:06,298
touch on that too what are your thoughts

865
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:07,409
on skittles Tim and I know you grow a

866
00:42:06,298 --> 00:42:13,349
lot of skittles and you grow some

867
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:16,018
amazing skittles man it's a bitch it's

868
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:17,809
literally one of the hardest plants to

869
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:21,958
really get to do what you wanted to do

870
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:25,019
just finicky you know - doesn't want too

871
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:27,538
much water doesn't want too much food it

872
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:29,368
took us probably five or six rounds

873
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:31,289
before we really kind of got it down to

874
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:33,150
a point where we could run it you know

875
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:35,729
in a production environment and have it

876
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,009
be worth our time yeah I feel like it's

877
00:42:35,728 --> 00:42:42,509
just the evolution of og cush it was

878
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:44,309
like it was like Girl Scout cookies was

879
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:47,548
the same finicky bullshit and now we

880
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:49,048
have skittles and it's like the skittles

881
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:50,518
work isn't done though I feel like

882
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:54,688
skittles will evolve into something that

883
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:57,088
has many cool things like the chrome

884
00:42:54,688 --> 00:43:00,838
rose a skittles that you made which is

885
00:42:57,088 --> 00:43:02,578
phenomenal and like rosewater candy with

886
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:04,108
with hopefully better structure I think

887
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,509
that needs to be Fino hunted a little

888
00:43:04,108 --> 00:43:08,909
more but yeah unfortunately with those

889
00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:10,798
ones the the ones that the best herb

890
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:13,288
profiles again just started the

891
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:14,969
structure structure just degraded got

892
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:16,199
worse and worse but the Turks got better

893
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:19,309
and better next thing you know I was

894
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:21,479
back at a you know skittles structure so

895
00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:24,329
but I stayed there because the Turks

896
00:43:21,478 --> 00:43:26,518
were better so it's a rough thing I mean

897
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:29,068
you gotta if you love turps

898
00:43:26,518 --> 00:43:30,598
you got a prioritized turps and I feel

899
00:43:29,068 --> 00:43:33,268
like you know that's kind of what

900
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,769
happened in Europe years ago why

901
00:43:33,268 --> 00:43:38,159
oh gee Chris got messed up was because

902
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:40,438
they were going for more of the

903
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,118
structure on the og Trishna and it was

904
00:43:40,438 --> 00:43:45,089
something that was like a white widow og

905
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:48,870
Trish they didn't have any gas

906
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:50,820
Sardarji no you know G is all about that

907
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:53,460
gas eater profile you know you get the

908
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:56,280
pine the lemon and the gas it's got to

909
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:59,550
have that chemi gas you know what what

910
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,769
evolved from like we saw it at 91 with

911
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:06,269
like chem dog starting in the earlier

912
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:08,039
90s that that pungency and I think the

913
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:11,190
Europeans have kind of got back on track

914
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:13,889
for the most part not all of them but a

915
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:16,349
lot of them especially with the gas

916
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:17,940
you're seeing gas over in Barcelona when

917
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:23,519
I was over there earlier this year there

918
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:25,980
was a lot of gas and then Ray Ray works

919
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,690
with a lot of fruit forward yeah he was

920
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,360
doing desert strains before they're even

921
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:32,970
called desert strains he has one of my

922
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,610
favorite doctor who fee knows it's

923
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:38,239
called the grape Heights you let me get

924
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:42,390
you let's talk about that it all right

925
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:45,529
sure just really fruity we get a lot of

926
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:48,389
grape that comes through on that strain

927
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:50,370
fruits are my thing I just like fruits I

928
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:52,769
think every breath every breeder has

929
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:55,230
more of their own thing in pilot that

930
00:44:52,769 --> 00:44:57,360
that they like to use you know and for

931
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,460
us it was more fruits my kids would like

932
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:04,010
dirt so you know we have the sweet Irish

933
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:07,670
crosses but but yeah with the fruits

934
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:11,480
they're nice they're they're complex

935
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:15,050
it's easy to get straight from but

936
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,909
you've been working on them for a while

937
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:21,030
the gray pipe here is just a specific

938
00:45:17,909 --> 00:45:23,369
cut that we found really in the first

939
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:26,730
seed pop we did of the strain when we

940
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:28,319
made the cross so many years ago well

941
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:30,030
there's so many different fee knows of

942
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:33,240
the Doctor Who and I know you made a lot

943
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:34,950
of seeds when you guys made them you

944
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,049
want to talk about the lineage from that

945
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:41,369
and you know kind of how you guys pieced

946
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:44,010
that one together so dr. Hugh is a mad

947
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:47,849
scientist which mad scientist is

948
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:50,430
Medicine Woman by sweet tooth Medicine

949
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:55,719
Woman was created by a gentleman in

950
00:45:50,429 --> 00:46:03,129
Oregon Dave it's a

951
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:04,449
let me think here so yeah I'm drawing a

952
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:06,099
blank right at the moment it's been kind

953
00:46:04,449 --> 00:46:10,239
of a long day and I just smoked so I

954
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:14,760
apologize oh god am i dynamite by d13

955
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:22,269
hash plant dynamite is a grapefruit Fino

956
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:24,730
and yeah so that to sweet tooth came out

957
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:27,818
with our mad scientist which is kind of

958
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:32,139
a fruity funky that we did well with we

959
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:35,889
won two cups in Oregon at the om CAS

960
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:40,029
with that and then we hit that with our

961
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:42,338
time wreck mel that when we were testers

962
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:45,670
for TGA in the very very beginning of it

963
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:47,349
all time wreckers one of the new strains

964
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,909
the dioxide had created and we were

965
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:50,530
fortunate enough to be one of the

966
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:53,799
testers and we found a mal that we

967
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:55,390
really liked I got it the okay to go

968
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,510
ahead and read with them and we started

969
00:46:55,389 --> 00:47:00,489
reading with him and you know we the

970
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:03,119
name wise just kind of worked a mad

971
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:06,039
scientist in a time wreck right but uh

972
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:10,450
the the pheno has turned out fantastic

973
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:13,000
we did like 30-something 40-something

974
00:47:10,449 --> 00:47:15,669
females the first run and every one of

975
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,750
them was like super fruity - rotten

976
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:23,980
fruit had rotten through yeah awesome

977
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:26,019
you know geek farms they found one that

978
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:30,460
really goes back to the hash plant

979
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:34,420
lineage so that's beautiful it's more of

980
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:37,179
a funkier taste to it than fruity but

981
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:41,858
it's really really stony so it's it's

982
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:44,828
nice but yeah you know it was just as

983
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:48,309
all crosses more more novelties than

984
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:50,769
anything else right some of them do did

985
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:52,900
some of them don't but that one doesn't

986
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:55,358
really good and it's done really good

987
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:59,180
for several years

988
00:47:55,358 --> 00:48:01,248
yeah yeah it's been around a while it's

989
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:04,759
been crushing the NorCal scene for quite

990
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:08,988
a while yeah yeah it does well wherever

991
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:10,728
wherever wherever it goes we've reached

992
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:12,978
a point now to where we've had an

993
00:48:10,728 --> 00:48:13,969
unfortunate had a bad winter and lost

994
00:48:12,978 --> 00:48:17,149
all of our males

995
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:20,748
so Doctor Who and quantum fish and all

996
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:28,099
those will no longer be made and you

997
00:48:20,748 --> 00:48:30,768
make a feminist you know we'll see how

998
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:32,900
it goes yeah I mean you got my attention

999
00:48:30,768 --> 00:48:35,058
I'm enjoying up there working on all

1000
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:38,180
this I'm learning a lot I'm waiting to

1001
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:40,278
see how it goes you know I mean it's

1002
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:43,338
interesting and I can completely see the

1003
00:48:40,278 --> 00:48:45,940
future of this on commercial large-scale

1004
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:49,748
levels gonna be feminized autopen seeds

1005
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:52,849
yeah auto fan regular fan full term

1006
00:48:49,748 --> 00:48:55,189
doing these hybrids these semi autos I

1007
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:57,798
think has a huge potential I mean

1008
00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:01,940
there's all these different things and

1009
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:03,409
man it's like I can't wait for the next

1010
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:06,409
five years to see what people are

1011
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:08,389
crushing out I you know it's like

1012
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:10,399
another thing with feminized seeds so

1013
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:13,278
when you're breeding feminized when

1014
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,079
you're doing selections you're something

1015
00:49:13,278 --> 00:49:16,789
yeah you don't always stuff but you can

1016
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:18,979
sell if something is the most ideal way

1017
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:20,749
and you're getting rid of 50% of the

1018
00:49:18,978 --> 00:49:22,399
alleles so you're working with half the

1019
00:49:20,748 --> 00:49:25,218
genetics so as you're making something

1020
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:28,219
that's more stable meaning less you know

1021
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:30,858
typical variation you can achieve that a

1022
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:33,858
lot faster now the only thing we need to

1023
00:49:30,858 --> 00:49:37,219
do is actually learn how to tissue

1024
00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:38,778
culture autos that's that's a comment

1025
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:43,190
for someone who's watching hopefully

1026
00:49:38,778 --> 00:49:46,429
from dsg labs one of mine Joseph's good

1027
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:49,099
friends we need to work on that ASAP so

1028
00:49:46,429 --> 00:49:52,960
we can get the tissue culture autos I

1029
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:52,960
feel like that's gonna be a game changer

1030
00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:04,729
stable lines because right now one term

1031
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:07,670
finishes and that's it the future is to

1032
00:50:04,728 --> 00:50:09,018
be able to breed with one phenotype so

1033
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:11,630
you're basically selling it on

1034
00:50:09,018 --> 00:50:14,268
self and the only way to achieve that

1035
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,919
would be through tissue culture and if

1036
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:18,828
there's any tissue culture people

1037
00:50:15,918 --> 00:50:22,278
watching there's a lot of big money that

1038
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:24,499
would be paid for being able to tissue

1039
00:50:22,278 --> 00:50:27,648
culture an auto flower plant and Jay

1040
00:50:24,498 --> 00:50:30,078
from finest he died around this time

1041
00:50:27,648 --> 00:50:31,548
last year him and I were in talks of

1042
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,289
trying to figure it out he thought he

1043
00:50:31,548 --> 00:50:37,909
had a solution for it and then ended up

1044
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:40,640
dying like four days later so I'll tell

1045
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:42,798
you what it was yeah he actually did he

1046
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:45,259
told me that it actually needed to go

1047
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:47,568
into flour he's done the carbohydrate

1048
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:49,248
you had to have the Brix levels the

1049
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:50,929
carbohydrate in the plan at a certain

1050
00:50:49,248 --> 00:50:55,009
point before you started to do the

1051
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:56,838
tissue culture process and Joseph might

1052
00:50:55,009 --> 00:50:59,478
be able to touch on that a little bit

1053
00:50:56,838 --> 00:51:01,009
but that's what he thought as a starting

1054
00:50:59,478 --> 00:51:02,898
point because it's so similar like

1055
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:16,429
that's that's how they do tomatoes

1056
00:51:02,898 --> 00:51:19,458
apparently ideas like degrees edging and

1057
00:51:16,429 --> 00:51:23,119
Easter culture I find it super

1058
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:26,418
interesting a Canadian group came out

1059
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:31,009
and actually did exactly that in the

1060
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:32,989
period flowers in various plants where

1061
00:51:31,009 --> 00:51:37,929
they sent plants eight sent the flower

1062
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:40,668
and basically reached in those tissues

1063
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:45,559
back to get vegetative growth is

1064
00:51:40,668 --> 00:51:48,228
difficult it's been laid to like read

1065
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:56,959
bitch a flowering plant in disrepair

1066
00:51:48,228 --> 00:51:58,698
just people just need to try it and yeah

1067
00:51:56,958 --> 00:52:01,308
I mean with all the accelerated breeding

1068
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:04,489
we're doing you know I mean it's amazing

1069
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:07,909
some of these companies like energy and

1070
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:10,728
guys like Eric Mathur who are doing

1071
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:12,619
these advanced greeting they're finding

1072
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:14,028
markers and then using those markers to

1073
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:16,690
breed where you're able to breed with a

1074
00:52:14,028 --> 00:52:20,650
small plant rather than happen

1075
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:23,200
being you know that's definitely part of

1076
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:25,480
the future you know not only just

1077
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,279
reading faster because at the end of the

1078
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,000
day what we really want to be doing I

1079
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,190
mean we're so hyped up on these s ones

1080
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,659
the future is creating stable lines and

1081
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:36,519
then making your own F once from your

1082
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:38,079
unstable lines that's what all the big

1083
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:40,300
companies are going to be doing we're

1084
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,219
gonna be creating IP and that IP is

1085
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,619
created for making your own stable lines

1086
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:46,959
with your own genetics and taking those

1087
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:51,220
to whatever it is whether it's an f7 or

1088
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:54,190
f9 and then adding heterosis heterosis

1089
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:56,739
is hybrid vigor so you take two stable

1090
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:58,690
lines that they don't have heterosis

1091
00:52:56,739 --> 00:53:01,509
because they've been inbred and in

1092
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:04,750
breeding actually makes the plant weaker

1093
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:06,280
and more susceptible to problems you

1094
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:09,550
take those stable lines you breed them

1095
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,290
together to create your own F ones that

1096
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,700
that's the way of the future in my

1097
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:17,019
opinion and that's kind of what I'm

1098
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:18,309
working on on a small scale compared to

1099
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:19,659
some of these big companies but that's

1100
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:22,119
what I'm working on with a couple

1101
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:23,920
companies in you know Marlon Asher and I

1102
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:26,470
are working on some stuff in Saint

1103
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,760
Vincent and Trinidad we were trying to

1104
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:29,259
get rolling we were about to launch a

1105
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,350
seed company in Spain before the whole

1106
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:33,850
kovin thing hit and then Tim and I are

1107
00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:37,389
working on some seed stuff hopefully

1108
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:41,319
that he's knocking out and we got some

1109
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:44,349
big news coming up that is true you you

1110
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:46,359
can't break it now oh no we're not gonna

1111
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:48,159
break it now on the show we it has to

1112
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:50,279
happen before we break the big news and

1113
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:52,779
then we'll break it on your show okay

1114
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,269
but it's gonna be big it's gonna be so

1115
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:57,910
we got some game-changing stuff and you

1116
00:53:55,269 --> 00:54:00,460
know my books coming out all these guys

1117
00:53:57,909 --> 00:54:03,969
are pretty much in my book and we got

1118
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:06,340
some really cool stuff not only about

1119
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:10,719
feminized seeds but just about breeding

1120
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:14,230
in general and Tim's mr. ya mister uh

1121
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:16,839
mister wizard because his cool ideas in

1122
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:19,840
there why I want to hear you had

1123
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:23,280
mentioned kind of Oddi being kind of

1124
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:26,260
about fruit-forward I once I want

1125
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,619
someone else first to talk about you

1126
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:31,869
like Tim what do you think gene

1127
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:33,940
is about or OD or short what do you

1128
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:38,318
think like tell me in your mind like

1129
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:40,809
what's James all about you know where he

1130
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:43,358
knows right now of James and stuff and I

1131
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:45,660
think every single pretty much every

1132
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:49,808
single cultivar had the word gas in it

1133
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:52,629
the name actually yeah I'm old school

1134
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:55,210
they guessed that gas is what got me in

1135
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:57,490
whose cat piss first and then Kappas

1136
00:54:55,210 --> 00:55:00,220
disappeared go I've been smoking since

1137
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:02,558
91 and we had cat piss and then we had

1138
00:55:00,219 --> 00:55:04,318
chem dong chem dog was cum Doggett Sour

1139
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,730
Diesel were like game-changing strains

1140
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:08,199
for me because you could smoke them down

1141
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:12,490
to the roach and they still tasted

1142
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:15,429
amazing and so to this day it's totally

1143
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:17,348
stuck with me the gas I love I love yes

1144
00:55:15,429 --> 00:55:18,730
but it's now we were at a point where he

1145
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:20,499
can't just be gas because there's a

1146
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:22,269
fucking million oh geez so now it's got

1147
00:55:20,498 --> 00:55:24,248
to be something else you gotta have gas

1148
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:27,219
with fruit you know I'm all about

1149
00:55:24,248 --> 00:55:29,078
complexity so if you know me you know

1150
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:30,879
I'm a chef as well and I've owned

1151
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:33,249
restaurants and I've been in the

1152
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,259
culinary industry I'm all about layers

1153
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:37,419
of complexity and I think those things

1154
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:40,719
are important and gas is an almost an

1155
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:43,480
essential layer for me I think so

1156
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:46,328
so get give me on on the food side with

1157
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:48,489
your food analogy a food that you like

1158
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:54,190
that that you like to cook that has lots

1159
00:55:48,489 --> 00:55:55,838
of layers and what are those layers well

1160
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:58,119
I mean you can do that with anything

1161
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:59,588
because I food you actually layer the

1162
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:01,930
dish like if you're if you're making a

1163
00:55:59,588 --> 00:56:05,170
plate you have seven components you want

1164
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:06,868
a layer texture you want a layer flavor

1165
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:08,889
you want to have complementary flavors

1166
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:10,630
but you want each one of the Flair

1167
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:14,858
flavors to stand out I worked at Chez

1168
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:17,920
Panisse years ago and it's very rustic

1169
00:56:14,858 --> 00:56:19,538
style and they use the minimum amount of

1170
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,829
ingredients but the best ingredients you

1171
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:24,489
can get in the whole world I've never

1172
00:56:20,829 --> 00:56:26,559
seen ingredients as close now maybe some

1173
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:28,449
of the places around the area and Bay

1174
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,130
Area have better plating but you will

1175
00:56:28,449 --> 00:56:32,889
not find fresher ingredients and what

1176
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:34,599
they do is they layer the flavors so if

1177
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,248
they're using a couple of different

1178
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:39,190
herbs you taste all those herbs it's not

1179
00:56:36,248 --> 00:56:41,558
just in there to enhance the flavor

1180
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,760
there's not 50 ingredients I like my

1181
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:45,730
layers

1182
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:48,000
to be subtle sometimes and I like

1183
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:51,340
sometimes stuff to be bold but I'm more

1184
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,980
leaning towards the subtleties whether

1185
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:56,380
it's in alcohol whether it's in I don't

1186
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:57,849
smoke tobacco anymore but even tobacco I

1187
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:00,849
like you know the subtleties with

1188
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:02,380
tobacco I think all these guys their

1189
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:06,789
tobacco except for justice I don't think

1190
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:08,500
Joseph smokes but uh yeah you were

1191
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:10,329
talking about one one type of food you

1192
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,480
can you can do that with pasta you can

1193
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:14,679
do that with pizza I love sushi so she's

1194
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:19,539
like one of my favorite things in the

1195
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:22,929
world to eat and also to make yeah fuck

1196
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:24,849
noodle soup huge into Vietnamese and

1197
00:57:22,929 --> 00:57:28,269
even burritos it's like you want to yeah

1198
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:31,868
the broth firt like a good broth has a

1199
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:33,670
ton of complexity yeah totally that's

1200
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:36,220
that's what you want is that complexity

1201
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,630
and you know ramen is an example of

1202
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,969
something that has like a creaminess

1203
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:42,070
where they're not adding dairy to it I

1204
00:57:39,969 --> 00:57:45,069
love those kind of things and it has a

1205
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:47,559
thickness in a mouthfeel those things

1206
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:49,210
are important and also with cannabis you

1207
00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:52,299
know I think that the new wave is going

1208
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:53,800
to be creaminess so a lot of people have

1209
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,539
talked about fruit-forward that was a

1210
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,240
big thing with like the sherbert sand

1211
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:59,590
then even going blueberry muffin that's

1212
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:02,949
another great one and all these hitters

1213
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:07,059
and then moving forward I feel like the

1214
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:12,539
new thing is like cream the creaminess

1215
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:16,920
the smoke all right so so who wants to

1216
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:16,920
analyze short

1217
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:23,710
yields he likes he likes trichomes short

1218
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:26,920
is not the biggest smoker I mean I

1219
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:30,880
smoked with them at least two times in

1220
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:32,200
the last three years but uh yeah he's

1221
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,240
not the biggest smoker but he knows

1222
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:36,489
cannabis more than anybody I know I mean

1223
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:40,449
he the greenhouse facilities that he's

1224
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:44,019
run and just watching him analyse plants

1225
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:46,809
and people he's a you know he's a macro

1226
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:51,789
guy but also he's able to spawn out the

1227
00:58:46,809 --> 00:58:55,059
micro issues and I think my guess would

1228
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:56,050
be he likes all cannabis plants that

1229
00:58:55,059 --> 00:58:58,719
produce

1230
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:01,510
okay so he can be dispassionate when it

1231
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:04,599
comes to like flavor and smell and taste

1232
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:06,490
because he's he's not other things yeah

1233
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:10,029
I wouldn't say that he's like a gas or a

1234
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:15,250
fruit forward or a Dutch strain he likes

1235
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:17,980
perks he likes he knows chirps yeah

1236
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:19,949
cooking he can identify plant problems

1237
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:24,309
before their project which is an amazing

1238
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:27,519
art and teach other people to do it I

1239
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:29,889
think he's a you know as far as also

1240
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,289
picking out breeders and what's gonna be

1241
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:35,559
a good breeder you know I feel like he

1242
00:59:32,289 --> 00:59:40,829
is an ak47 a long time scale that he's

1243
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:44,409
worked at they've been able to work a

1244
00:59:40,829 --> 00:59:46,380
lot of people don't have so Accord what

1245
00:59:44,409 --> 00:59:49,559
what do you look for in a breeder

1246
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:52,720
someone I work with

1247
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:56,139
well I mean most of the breeders that

1248
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:59,259
we're kind of working with now have a

1249
00:59:56,139 --> 01:00:02,319
wide range like ray luvs you know kind

1250
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:05,230
of fruits or rotten fruit I've grown a

1251
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:06,760
lot of Ray's seeds out there's you can

1252
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:10,449
grow them in a field and be really happy

1253
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:15,760
with the results within each population

1254
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:17,469
there's enough differences slight

1255
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,380
differences to really be able to choose

1256
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:23,399
something really good karma genetics is

1257
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:26,769
all about the sour diesels and the gas

1258
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:29,860
so it's really encompassing the widest

1259
01:00:26,769 --> 01:00:31,750
range possible and to answer the

1260
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:34,660
question about what I like I like grease

1261
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:36,969
so you know we used to make a lot of

1262
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:39,069
hash so I know the resin glands have to

1263
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:41,799
have a certain consistency to make good

1264
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:44,200
hash but I really like that grease that

1265
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,269
just drips you know and when the day

1266
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:48,819
gets hot those those trichomes are

1267
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:52,119
leaking and that's kind of reminiscent

1268
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:55,330
from the old Afghani strains and that

1269
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:57,489
kind of kerosene caramel chocolate

1270
01:00:55,329 --> 01:01:08,449
that's really my that's really what I

1271
01:00:57,489 --> 01:01:10,098
look for Tim tell me about Tim okay

1272
01:01:08,449 --> 01:01:14,210
I want someone else to tell us about

1273
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:16,760
your he's a he's a farmer he's

1274
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:20,119
old-school he's worked in California and

1275
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:22,339
he's worked down in South America as far

1276
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:24,950
as what he likes he likes stuff that

1277
01:01:22,338 --> 01:01:28,309
gets should get you ripped he likes terr

1278
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:30,649
Peter Peter piece tough and he's a

1279
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:36,049
sun-grown sort of guy he likes that

1280
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:39,139
green house profile over that indoor but

1281
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:41,240
like he's he's a he's on the hot modern

1282
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:45,828
streams but also using the old school

1283
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:48,469
stuff alongside it I feel like he likes

1284
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:52,130
gas to a little bit he likes fruit he

1285
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:53,779
likes that pungent skunky smell he's a

1286
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:56,150
big proponent of wedding cake I know

1287
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:59,359
that they do some wedding cake crosses

1288
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:00,950
that are amazing up there and gelatos

1289
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:07,210
we're big we're both of us are getting a

1290
01:02:00,949 --> 01:02:07,210
lot of students too so yeah gelato Pluto

1291
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:17,119
yeah the real Pluto the only one I know

1292
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:21,579
yeah yeah I think you've pretty much

1293
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:26,260
nailed it excellent

1294
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:29,030
so we got a question about breeders

1295
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:32,599
remember how Oakland indica was similar

1296
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:35,150
to a G chem if I remember so we had

1297
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:35,769
Oakland I remember the indica from

1298
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:38,960
Oakland

1299
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:46,389
that was gassy and it probably did have

1300
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:48,889
some sort of it wasn't men so Oakland

1301
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:52,309
back in the day this isn't the 90s that

1302
01:02:48,889 --> 01:02:54,650
are probably 94 95 which is forever ago

1303
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:57,380
that's almost 30 years ago which is

1304
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:59,420
crazy but we had this indica and it was

1305
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:04,730
it had a pungency to it but I wouldn't

1306
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:05,990
say that it was chem or og I would say

1307
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:09,519
that the one I'm thinking of is

1308
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:16,250
definitely more of like on the skunky

1309
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:18,050
Afghan like acrid pungent stuff there

1310
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:21,829
was a lot of that stuff going around we

1311
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:23,568
used to go down this too to not

1312
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:25,400
Santa Barbara but Santa Cruz and get

1313
01:03:23,568 --> 01:03:27,228
this skunk number one I found out it was

1314
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,880
not one number one years later but it

1315
01:03:27,228 --> 01:03:30,108
was actually we call it the strawberry

1316
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,749
because of those strawberry signs

1317
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:34,880
Nuggets they called it strawberry $60 in

1318
01:03:32,748 --> 01:03:37,759
a straight up you want to buy an ounce

1319
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:41,349
in $60 in a we're going back to those

1320
01:03:37,759 --> 01:03:45,528
prices to it's crazy

1321
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:46,880
bleh yeah any other questions first

1322
01:03:45,528 --> 01:03:49,400
Peter I think we got to wrap it up

1323
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:53,749
pretty shortly here yeah well just for

1324
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:56,088
me kind of what what's a like I know you

1325
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:57,558
guys have big libraries and access to

1326
01:03:56,088 --> 01:04:00,199
stuff well what's like a cut you've

1327
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:03,849
recently gotten from someone else that

1328
01:04:00,199 --> 01:04:08,169
you're having fun playing with right now

1329
01:04:03,849 --> 01:04:10,489
I've got creme Rose a skittles from Tim

1330
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:13,190
what do I got something from short as

1331
01:04:10,489 --> 01:04:15,889
well and then I just got some stuff from

1332
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:18,229
OD I got the I can't remember what I got

1333
01:04:15,889 --> 01:04:19,548
from OD but I'm actually not allowed to

1334
01:04:18,228 --> 01:04:23,629
talk about what I got for Milly it's

1335
01:04:19,548 --> 01:04:25,608
really amazing so but the way the other

1336
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:28,309
stuff like what do you psyche to explore

1337
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:31,338
with them okay so with Tim's Primrose a

1338
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:35,509
skittles I just what what I get excited

1339
01:04:31,338 --> 01:04:38,568
about is when I find something novel and

1340
01:04:35,509 --> 01:04:39,949
that seems to be pretty rare I think a

1341
01:04:38,568 --> 01:04:42,199
lot of people you know there's a million

1342
01:04:39,949 --> 01:04:44,150
gelatos out there there's a literally

1343
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:45,559
there's a whole bunch of gelatos that

1344
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:47,599
are the same fuckin gelato there's a

1345
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:50,390
million yeah we see these different

1346
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,430
routes cuts and gelato cuts and there's

1347
01:04:50,389 --> 01:04:53,629
there's all these similarities what I

1348
01:04:52,429 --> 01:04:55,759
like is finding something that's

1349
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:57,979
absolutely novel that I've never tried

1350
01:04:55,759 --> 01:05:01,009
before he usually blows my mind and that

1351
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:04,038
creme Rose a skittles from Tim creme

1352
01:05:01,009 --> 01:05:06,528
Rosie is a strain from aficionado from

1353
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:08,539
leo that's amazing

1354
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:11,088
and pull with the skittles you get this

1355
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:14,959
this candy flavor from the skittles and

1356
01:05:11,088 --> 01:05:16,849
then it's complementary with the with

1357
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:19,578
the rose and it's actually rosewater I

1358
01:05:16,849 --> 01:05:22,160
hadn't tasted rosewater like actual

1359
01:05:19,579 --> 01:05:24,440
rosewater in cannabis ever before in my

1360
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:27,649
life till I tasted that stream I taste

1361
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:30,769
it grows like rose petals but not that

1362
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:32,838
intense like rose oil like you smoke the

1363
01:05:30,768 --> 01:05:34,218
joint down and your two end of the joint

1364
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:37,630
they're like fuck it still tastes like

1365
01:05:34,219 --> 01:05:37,630
rose that's what I

1366
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:44,269
good one too now we need to get

1367
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:46,309
structure better yeah yeah we'll get

1368
01:05:44,269 --> 01:05:48,110
there we'll get there I got I got a

1369
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:50,809
bunch of those beans we got to just sort

1370
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:52,780
through them and find a winner yeah I

1371
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:56,269
got some of those we popped so we'll see

1372
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:58,550
right on and just quickly going down the

1373
01:05:56,269 --> 01:06:00,289
line sim what's something you've got

1374
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:03,170
your hands on recently that you're

1375
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:05,750
having fun with and I what do you want

1376
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:08,030
to do with it yeah you know that's a

1377
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:10,670
good question to be honest with you we

1378
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:12,200
we were having a bunch of James's he

1379
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:14,780
knows right now we're just getting into

1380
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:17,239
them besides oh so you know we a while

1381
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:19,519
back close our doors to new genetics cuz

1382
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:21,139
it's just sketchy out there with all the

1383
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,420
viruses going around with everything

1384
01:06:21,139 --> 01:06:25,759
that that's able to come in on these so

1385
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:27,950
we you know we have a huge library we're

1386
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,570
just kind of working through our own I'm

1387
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:31,309
at the moment we are doing a pretty

1388
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:32,930
significant hunt right now a lot of

1389
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:37,159
James's stuff and I know we're gonna

1390
01:06:32,929 --> 01:06:38,569
find some real winners in there yeah I

1391
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:42,289
can't say I have anything though you

1392
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:45,140
know we got some some Pluto kind of bag

1393
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:49,699
seeds that we're gonna see see what

1394
01:06:45,139 --> 01:06:52,279
comes of those and yeah I'm just excited

1395
01:06:49,699 --> 01:06:54,469
to see what pops out of this stuff and I

1396
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:56,210
could I could I answer you better in

1397
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:57,349
about two months exactly what I'm

1398
01:06:56,210 --> 01:07:02,960
excited about

1399
01:06:57,349 --> 01:07:04,489
yeah and Ray yeah you know I'm kind of

1400
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,639
in the same boat really haven't brought

1401
01:07:04,489 --> 01:07:08,989
in much very new stuff I'm kind of

1402
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:13,039
digging through some old stuff that

1403
01:07:08,989 --> 01:07:14,899
hasn't been played with that much I find

1404
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:18,019
it more interesting there's a lot of the

1405
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:19,639
newer stuff so what's something what's

1406
01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:28,849
something from the archives that you're

1407
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:30,619
going back to we're so at one point in

1408
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:33,559
time here's the farm and I did some

1409
01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:36,920
collabs I think I'm gonna dive back into

1410
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:38,570
a few of those we have a blood wreck

1411
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,059
back cross that we did that I'm going to

1412
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:44,720
dive into breath moment we're doing a

1413
01:07:41,059 --> 01:07:47,090
lot of back back crossing work as I said

1414
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:49,099
we lost our mouths so we're kind of in

1415
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:49,400
the middle of looking for what we're

1416
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:51,679
going to

1417
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:54,079
work with next and figured back crossing

1418
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,329
our main mothers back out would be a

1419
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:58,639
good start way they're a little bit more

1420
01:07:56,329 --> 01:08:02,269
true as we go forward and work with them

1421
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:05,480
more so but you know we did some smaller

1422
01:08:02,269 --> 01:08:07,280
batch seeds here recently that some

1423
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:10,670
really nice stuff came out of we did a

1424
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:15,320
lemon G by dr. who those turned out

1425
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:28,279
fantastic you know so just some of that

1426
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:40,569
kind of stuff got it Joe alright you

1427
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:43,719
know is short and sweet and assured

1428
01:08:40,569 --> 01:08:47,569
because you are a library right

1429
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:51,199
yeah we've consolidated I mean when when

1430
01:08:47,569 --> 01:08:55,519
we do see no hands we usually run them

1431
01:08:51,199 --> 01:09:00,470
three times from clone usually end up on

1432
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:02,690
about 0.3% they're really looking for

1433
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:05,240
primary flavors you know everything

1434
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:09,589
washes out so quickly so getting back to

1435
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:11,689
real primary flavors to work with we're

1436
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:14,960
running a bunch of Sour Diesel BX threes

1437
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:17,619
right now for breeding and seeing from

1438
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:21,859
karma genetics and seeing how they

1439
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:25,099
crossed with other plants and so far

1440
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:27,649
this you get a really nice range from

1441
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:29,590
Sour like the guava gelato with the Sour

1442
01:09:27,649 --> 01:09:33,289
Diesel there's a really nice range

1443
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:34,789
complexity throughout so the sour stuff

1444
01:09:33,289 --> 01:09:37,489
is really nice and then but the base

1445
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:39,979
thing is to really add II get back to

1446
01:09:37,489 --> 01:09:50,449
basic flavor profiles without ending up

1447
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:53,209
with 1985 schwag challenge got it well I

1448
01:09:50,449 --> 01:09:59,750
James you got a rap right cuz everybody

1449
01:09:53,210 --> 01:10:01,489
has to go yep okay so thank you James

1450
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:04,010
and to the

1451
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:08,139
everybody else on the call and the

1452
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:11,630
hundred and fifty people still tuned in

1453
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,400
we appreciate it and we'll see you

1454
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:16,579
actually so basically tomorrow we're

1455
01:10:13,399 --> 01:10:20,259
doing something on IPM tomorrow night we

1456
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:24,979
