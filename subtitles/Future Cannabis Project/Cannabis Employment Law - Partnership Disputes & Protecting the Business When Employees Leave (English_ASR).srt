[Music]

2
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:29,629
encountered and a lot of handshake

3
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:32,719
agreements folks that sort of put to put

4
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:34,969
companies together on the ground level

5
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,369
and sort of trusted each other that they

6
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:39,379
would do the right thing so we've had a

7
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:41,358
lot more partnership disputes where

8
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:44,030
somebody would show up to a dispensary

9
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,370
or a manufacturing plant and literally

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,010
the locks are changed and people pretend

11
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:50,839
not to know each other and so you gave

12
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,719
to these disputes about who owns what

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,980
whether its revenue of the company

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,039
intellectual property that sort of stuff

15
00:00:54,979 --> 00:01:01,009
so there's that going on at an

16
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,300
increasing rate and then I think another

17
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:04,579
thing that the industry is starting to

18
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:07,489
figure out as it comes away from

19
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:09,769
licensing and a focus on compliance

20
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:11,719
there they're starting to look at

21
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:14,750
branding and the importance of branding

22
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,219
really I think in the context of I want

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,709
to get investment in my company or I

24
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:20,780
want to build this and sell it so I have

25
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:23,359
to have brand recognition and brand

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,070
protection and IP protection but there's

27
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,200
not really an understanding or a focus

28
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:29,989
on the fact that that has to start with

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,520
your employees because we've seen cases

30
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,530
where individuals have worked for a

31
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,799
company that company has been building

32
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,359
client base it's been building a product

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,879
it's got intellectual property and how

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,439
it does things and then we see employees

35
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,819
slipping out under the cover of darkness

36
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,859
and either going to work for a

37
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:49,309
competitor or setting up their their

38
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:51,090
business on their own and companies are

39
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,629
sort of left

40
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,430
flat-footed saying what do we do now I'm

41
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,469
not realizing what the landscape is and

42
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,479
again not realizing that there are some

43
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,739
things you can do on the front end to

44
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,840
put yourself in a position where

45
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:08,340
notwithstanding California's sort of

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,099
employee favoring laws you can still get

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,229
some some recourse from the courts in

48
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,209
terms of injunctive relief or damages

49
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:17,729
when employees do that and interact

50
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:21,120
competing is if you were to sort of give

51
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:23,789
best practices around the upfront things

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,670
one could do to protect yourself legally

53
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:29,069
from somebody jumping ship with all your

54
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:29,689
trade secrets your customer rolodex or

55
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,810
know-how

56
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:35,759
your idea and basically setting up you

57
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,769
know it's almost like you go to China

58
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,509
you set up a factory and then the head

59
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:42,530
of the factory goes across the street

60
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:45,149
yeah and creates the exact same product

61
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,689
that's the beauty of doing business in

62
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,090
the United States which for a canvas

63
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:53,099
company you don't have any choice but to

64
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,469
do all your business here in California

65
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,569
but it really runs the same sort of

66
00:02:55,469 --> 00:03:01,049
themes as we've discussed with the

67
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,699
industry as it relates to discrimination

68
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,430
or harassment prevention and sort of

69
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:07,169
setting up some things there so that if

70
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,540
there is a dispute as to why somebody's

71
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,189
let go you've got some documentation

72
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,989
around it so if you are trying to

73
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:15,000
protect your brand trying to protect

74
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,939
your trade secrets and your intellectual

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,919
property do those same things on the

76
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,699
front end identify what you treat as

77
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,108
trade secrets identify what you think is

78
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:27,569
intellectual property put agreements

79
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,010
between yourself and the employees that

80
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,500
say look you're going to work here

81
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,599
you're gainfully employed we want you

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,310
here but if you leave you can't take all

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,409
these things with you so that there's no

84
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,699
expectation that these are sort of out

85
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:43,169
and open to the public and beyond sort

86
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,849
of setting some of those parameters with

87
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,129
employees with written policies or

88
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,479
agreements treating that intellectual

89
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,479
property like it is intellectual

90
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:56,669
property so if it's client or customer

91
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:58,229
data or formulas or products put them

92
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,909
under lock and key treat them like the

93
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:04,569
the kernels

94
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:07,329
spices mix and coca-cola max exactly put

95
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:08,919
it under lock and key and let people

96
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,440
know that that's something that you hold

97
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,089
as intellectual property that you feel

98
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,810
is special to the company it shouldn't

99
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:21,040
be used outside of the company beyond

100
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:22,780
the employee theft which really relates

101
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,730
to having agreements and understandings

102
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:27,279
with him with the employee about what's

103
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:30,640
protected and what's not and treating

104
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:33,579
those things as protected I would say

105
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,729
that this business needs to get away

106
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:38,469
from the handshake agreements as between

107
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,030
partners and business owners it's it's

108
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,790
not that costly it's not that

109
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:44,859
complicated to get businesses into the

110
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,569
correct form have operating agreements

111
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,360
have partnership agreements or joint

112
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:51,310
venture agreement so that it lays out

113
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,129
who's a party - what who has equity who

114
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,319
owns what and so that that's something

115
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:57,790
that every one of these businesses

116
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,639
should have quite frankly for getting a

117
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,419
license that stuff should formalize in

118
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,529
that process

119
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:07,418
you mentioned operating agreements some

120
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:11,759
of the concrete blocking and tackling

121
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:13,449
steps one can do around that topic of

122
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,329
protecting your business when people

123
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:18,579
leave or when their disputes yeah so

124
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:20,139
when you're thinking about your partners

125
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:23,228
and the people that have an equity stake

126
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:25,418
in the business you want to have written

127
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:30,069
agreements in place that outline sort of

128
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:32,079
what that our rights are in that context

129
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:33,339
probably the biggest one to talk about

130
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,019
is non-competes

131
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,929
in California typically speaking you

132
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:40,478
can't prevent someone from leaving you

133
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,310
or leaving your company and competing

134
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,769
against you it's a restraint on trade

135
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,410
and California doesn't like it if

136
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:50,680
somebody has a ownership in the business

137
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,030
I won't go too deep into it a material

138
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,319
ownership in the business and there's

139
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:56,739
some sort of an event where they are

140
00:05:53,319 --> 00:06:00,279
liquidated they sell that to back to you

141
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,949
or you all sell to a third party because

142
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,469
they have that ownership there's an

143
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:08,129
exception to the non-compete law so

144
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,850
those sort of non-compete should exist

145
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:14,100
in those sort of agreements moving away

146
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:17,430
from sort of the partners and more

147
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,320
talking about the employees I would on

148
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,180
the front end when you're giving

149
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,839
somebody all those those forms that we

150
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,519
were talking about the application maybe

151
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,229
an offer letter with some of the terms

152
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,959
and conditions of their employment the

153
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,520
state-mandated notices copy of your

154
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,709
handbook with an acknowledgement

155
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:36,180
well there's in the handbook or not

156
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,699
there's there should be some sort of

157
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,110
standalone document that says maybe it's

158
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,810
in the offer letter or somewhere in that

159
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,879
process a documentation that this is

160
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,100
what our intellectual property procedure

161
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,620
is this is what we consider in the our

162
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,110
trade secrets and you can't go outside

163
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,329
of this company with them if you work on

164
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,610
a formula for an extraction method and

165
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:58,589
we come up with something amazing you

166
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,980
don't take that invention with you down

167
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:05,429
the road those are the big goes on the

168
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:07,590
front end and then on the back end just

169
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,090
