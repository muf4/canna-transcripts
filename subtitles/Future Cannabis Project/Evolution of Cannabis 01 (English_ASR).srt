1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,888
[Music]

2
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:17,689
demolition of canvas is really actually

3
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:19,579
a really really interesting subject

4
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:21,289
because if you talk to a lot of people

5
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:23,479
today the impression that one would get

6
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:25,880
is is that oh my gosh were we're in the

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,268
Golden Age we we you know technology has

8
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:32,960
has dragged this plan up a hill and and

9
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:34,850
it's never been better and and I think

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,859
that that's controversial actually I

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,840
think that we have lost some things

12
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:41,179
along the way and so what we're going to

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,490
talk about today is both a very very

14
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:45,259
bright future an interesting future but

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,630
also I think we're going to address some

16
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:50,710
of the things that maybe kind of got

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:53,719
lost in the in the green rush and

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:56,299
so I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of open up

19
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,969
with the panel on with very very short

20
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:01,489
bio so I want you to basically just kind

21
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:04,219
of help the audience get some sense of

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:06,618
who you are and what you're into hi I'm

23
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:09,439
Swami Chaitanya visvakarma brahmacharya

24
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:12,109
Gandhi Ananda and you say that again

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,299
rapidly right so I've been initiated in

26
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:18,140
several branches of yoga in India by

27
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:21,049
various priests and temples and gurus up

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,670
in the mountains and so on at the moment

29
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:24,978
you don't need to know where I went to

30
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,379
grammar school right and at the moment I

31
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:29,209
am a cannabis grower up at Mendocino

32
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:32,119
County where we grow the best cannabis

33
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:33,250
in the world and we're proud of it and I

34
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,430
have

35
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,200
90 acre farm and because of our legal

36
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,210
restrictions I've been able to grow very

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,609
few plants so I can't supply all of you

38
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:45,649
just yet but I'm hoping to get there

39
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:48,109
someday I'm very happy to be on this

40
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,090
panel and I think the idea of evolution

41
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,739
of cannabis is actually something we

42
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,000
really need to pay attention to so

43
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:55,000
thanks for being here

44
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,890
and I'm I'm Josh wars er the president

45
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,870
of SC labs analytical testing laboratory

46
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,270
and

47
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,310
before I was a chemist I was I loved

48
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,420
cannabis

49
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,310
as soon as I first started smoking it

50
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:15,829
than I had to start growing it and see

51
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,140
see how that worked and and so I saw it

52
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,630
through college and from high school to

53
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:22,069
college I was thinking of the cannabis

54
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,680
industry got my degree in chemistry

55
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,719
moved to California worked in

56
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,159
pharmaceutical industry electronic

57
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,349
materials doing research and development

58
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,599
and

59
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:35,629
saw saw a job opening for for laboratory

60
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,659
director at that time was the only lab

61
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:40,699
in the state

62
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:42,439
where was the only lab in the state that

63
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:44,209
would do cannabis testing and that was

64
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,159
that was Steve Bell sorry I took that

65
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:49,250
job and it realized like that I could

66
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,409
actually marry my two loves and from

67
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,969
from then on

68
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:54,289
I've been testing cannabis so I worked

69
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:55,789
there for about a year and then we

70
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:59,389
started SC labs so I've been doing this

71
00:02:55,789 --> 00:03:00,650
now for over seven years so it's been

72
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,019
really cool to kind of see the evolution

73
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,539
of at least the testing industry for

74
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,739
cannabis and as such that the labs kind

75
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:09,469
of the nexus in the industry the

76
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:11,569
producers come through the dispensaries

77
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,310
come through and a lot of patients come

78
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,719
through and so it's been a really cool

79
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,159
window to be able to kind of just watch

80
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,509
the last seven or eight years of the

81
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:26,199
industry of all ml prank and I've been

82
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:30,549
write writing about menopause since 1971

83
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:34,849
so I've written three books 1974

84
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:37,070
1977 and 1988 on growing marijuana also

85
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:39,680
published them the last one was I

86
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,319
updated in 1997 the marijuana growers

87
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,180
guide deluxe

88
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:47,060
also in the editor and publisher for Rob

89
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,300
Clark's hashish and to currently iced

90
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,239
consult I still contribute botanical

91
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,390
texts and photographs most recently the

92
00:03:53,239 --> 00:04:00,140
survive days encyclopedia of cannabis

93
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,239
over 100 photographs - that also - Ken

marijuana horticultural fundamentals

96
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,049
also botanical information over

97
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:17,298
good morning Jeff Raber I'm the CEO and

98
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:20,420
founder of the workshop in analytical

99
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,609
testing laboratory I got a bachelor's in

100
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,800
biochemistry and a PhD in synthetic

101
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,660
organic chemistry from the University of

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,569
Southern California I don't for any

103
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,100
Trojans out here and I you know

104
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,439
certainly got an interesting perspective

105
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,879
in cannabis being in the testing lab as

106
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,560
Josh mentioned do you kind of have a

107
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,259
bird's-eye view of the entire industry

108
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,269
and what we've been able to do with that

109
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,539
position is publish 5 peer-reviewed

110
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:46,969
literature articles most noted probably

111
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,680
on the chemo taxonomic profiling how to

112
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,690
look at terpenes and many of the

113
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,509
secondary metabolites of the plant to

114
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:56,600
start a identification system that means

115
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:58,610
more towards patients and doctors and

116
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,129
how he can communicate better about

117
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,360
which cannabis compositions were using

118
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,060
as opposed to just calling them an

119
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,110
indica and sativa and I'm very grateful

120
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,360
to be here today and appreciate the time

121
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,879
this idea that the evolution of the

122
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,580
plant and our relationship with the

123
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,279
plant we potentially may have lost a few

124
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:21,680
things on the way or we may want to look

125
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,239
back a little bit not that we've lost

126
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,759
but there are things that we can learn

127
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,610
from the past so I'd like to have each

128
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,339
of the panelists kind of address um what

129
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,569
are the things from from the past a

130
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:35,149
little bit you're interested in learning

131
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,250
about whether you're a lab or a

132
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:38,899
cultivator

133
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:42,529
what kind of opportunities are on the

134
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:46,069
horizon that could have enabled the past

135
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:48,289
a little bit for example in the case for

136
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,509
me I'm really interested in heirloom

137
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,410
varieties I'm interested in the low

138
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:56,569
yielding ultra interesting chemistry's

139
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,630
of some of the tropical varieties that

140
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:03,230
really are easy to spot by a helicopter

141
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:05,659
and but don't yield much and so I'm not

142
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,600
interested always in these the mythical

143
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,780
7-pound plant I'm interested in the one

144
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:15,350
pound of crazy interesting or I'm

145
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:17,168
interested in that one gram of dry sieve

146
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:21,249
that

147
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:23,348
really retains a terpene profile that I

148
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:26,229
current currently cannot find in

149
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:28,718
conventional extraction so that that's

150
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:30,998
we're looking to the past I think I can

151
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:33,248
actually bring a better future I'd like

152
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:34,389
to have any of your ideas on it well we

153
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:36,789
were talking the other day and you said

154
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:39,400
is there any skunk left right is there

155
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:40,959
any true skunk and so you know in a

156
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,388
sense like we don't really know how to

157
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,568
make stained glass for Gothic cathedrals

158
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:48,430
anymore so stuff gets lost you know and

159
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,749
with a skunk well is there some so

160
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,189
anybody have a skunk out there we want

161
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:53,620
some seeds because we want to grow it

162
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,419
but there's something well I just want

163
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,278
to make a little statement about what we

164
00:06:55,418 --> 00:07:00,240
lost in terms of our cannabis culture

165
00:06:57,278 --> 00:07:03,069
because of all this regulation and

166
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,228
we used to be in the cannabis community

167
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,449
could deliver cannabis to every small

168
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:09,399
town in this country for the last 40 50

169
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,379
years California's been doing that and

170
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,149
we've done that without brick and mortar

171
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:14,439
we've done that without advertising

172
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:17,049
we've done that without bank account's

173
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:19,838
without cash we've done that without it

174
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,759
you know without any protection every

175
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:24,399
police force is trying to stop us right

176
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,158
and there was no plan and there was an

177
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,019
amazing way that we could do this and no

178
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:31,360
one quite knows how but the cannabis

179
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:33,579
community could deliver all across the

180
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,580
country a cannabis to just about anyone

181
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:39,038
right and that was done by a million

182
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:41,198
random decisions of a million different

183
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:44,288
people that Johnny knew Susie back in

184
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,149
Ohio and you know Sam knew Linda back in

185
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:48,490
Boston and they sent them a pound and

186
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,528
this went across and you know whatever

187
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,838
trillions of dollars have been spent on

188
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:55,180
it they couldn't stop it right and

189
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:56,879
that's because the plant has this innate

190
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,259
character the plant has this innate

191
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,910
spirituality that connects to everyone

192
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:04,220
on a Bay but what I want to talk about

193
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,080
is that community that we had that you

194
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,760
know thousand dollar ten thousand

195
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,918
hundred thousand dollar deals were done

196
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,430
between people on a handshake and a look

197
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:15,829
in the eye and it worked and we were

198
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,480
able to do this and it's something that

199
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,430
I don't there's this community feeling

200
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,990
that we were all together and there's

201
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,449
another thing also just about the fact

202
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,220
that it was in legal that we had an

203
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,469
underground community that actually came

204
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,630
out of the anti-war movement that can

205
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,000
came out of the civil rights movement we

206
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:33,320
were all used to being in opposition as

207
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,629
activists who are used to being

208
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,969
underground and just cannabis came along

209
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:39,740
and and chilled us all out so is that

210
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,680
underground community of recognition

211
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,000
that were a secret you know where is you

212
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,919
know it's almost like the Harry Potter

213
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,690
thing we're all the Wizards in here and

214
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,759
we're trying to and we keep this

215
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,830
knowledge amongst ourselves and we pass

216
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,149
it around and and it is a sacred

217
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,120
knowledge and it's a sacred knowledge

218
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,588
that's at least 10,000 years old and so

219
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,750
we want to keep that sacred knowledge

220
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,750
amongst us Wizards but now

221
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:10,549
so so what's funny is is that if you go

222
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,850
back to the 1940s one of the popular

223
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:15,319
slang terms for cannabis was muggle yeah

224
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,960
alright so if you go back to miss miss

225
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,629
Rose

226
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,730
yeah so um Josh what do you think of

227
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:25,700
what about the best well I agree with

228
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,470
everything Tommy just said it I I do a

229
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,870
hundred percent it and I think you know

230
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,670
it's sad but at the same time you know

231
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,039
I'm glad people aren't gonna get locked

232
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:36,110
in cages anymore for for forgetting

233
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,240
cannabis out there and but but it is sad

234
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,820
to see see see kind of the culture go

235
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,860
and it's just inevitable it's it's I

236
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,540
guess everything changes but but I give

237
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,000
you a hundred percent with all of that

238
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:48,620
it is kind of sad and you know there

239
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,809
used to be a secret place where you know

240
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,310
you go to any party and you know the

241
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,229
people you're going in let's go let's go

242
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:55,639
stand over here and now now everyone's

243
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,000
showing up to that circus a look in the

244
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:01,069
eye little not ya know woman but but but

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,350
but beyond that and I'm gonna I'm gonna

246
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,830
rip on the lab industry for a second um

247
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,480
you know we I think it's great that

248
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,120
we're finally you know getting quality

249
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,670
control for the plant and I and I think

250
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,340
it absolutely needs it and it's such a

251
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:17,860
safe plant that it were very lucky that

252
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:21,009
that we haven't had any any anyone died

253
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,720
or any instances of you know for

254
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:24,519
instance e.coli outbreaks in cannabis

255
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,070
that would have really put a damper on

256
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,289
legalization but but nonetheless

257
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,879
cannabis does need quality control just

258
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:33,189
like everything else and who knows was

259
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,360
sprayed on your your pot and us doing

260
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,680
their testing there's there's a lot of

261
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,009
things sprayed on your pot is the answer

262
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:41,259
but I think one of the real detriments

263
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,539
the testing industry has done to the

264
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:45,490
cannabis industry is is you know no one

265
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:48,279
wants to grow plants at tests under 20%

266
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,220
now and we've lost a lot of great

267
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,409
strains a lot of interesting strains

268
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,500
that really unique protein profiles

269
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:58,870
really unique eyes because no one's

270
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,659
growing those 14% 12% strains no one's

271
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,639
growing then the public pushes and in

272
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:05,409
the great be purples anymore because

273
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,049
they don't test too low and hopefully

274
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:09,519
that'll go away as as prices come down I

275
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:10,629
think of you know that as I said the

276
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,819
pressure I think a big part of it was

277
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,559
getting the most bang for your buck and

278
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,910
maybe that's one of the good things

279
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,619
that's coming along with legalization is

280
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:19,029
that prices have come down to to where

281
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,009
people can afford it people who want to

282
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:22,209
pay more for

283
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:23,769
really high quality cannabis can but

284
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,509
people who don't have the money and just

285
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,460
need to go in and get some cannabis law

286
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:29,409
will have their options too but but I

287
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,200
think that the the laboratory industry

288
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:35,799
really kind of did a disservice by by

289
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,360
just testing for for THC content and it

290
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:39,609
got to be just a numbers game bigger is

291
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,169
better now that terpene testing is

292
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,350
available we're realizing that that

293
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:47,649
really THC content is is I guess

294
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,659
irrelevant as far as quality goes you

295
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,129
you know take an extra hit I I enjoy the

296
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,719
process of smoking I'd rather smoke

297
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:54,490
twice as much and smoke a joint all the

298
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,800
way down then get a few hits and have to

299
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:01,080
put it down and you have a taster

300
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:03,120
so so I'm you know it's just kind of a

301
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,740
byproduct of what we did and so

302
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,970
hopefully now people are going to start

303
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,190
realizing that that what's interesting

304
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,840
about one kind of a strain or another it

305
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,460
has nothing to do with you know how much

306
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,250
THC it has and it's it's all about

307
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,750
what's the terpene profile how are those

308
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,389
terpenes preserved in a growing process

309
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,769
who can who can grow and dry their

310
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:21,269
cannabis in a way that preserves those

311
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:23,939
terpenes and who can grow unique strains

312
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:26,340
that have unique profiles so and I'll

313
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,450
riff on that that's a great comment one

314
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,790
of the things I'm really interested in

315
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,259
is this thing that I interviewed Raphael

316
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:33,120
Michelle and we got discovered THC and

317
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:36,600
CBD and what he said was he was talking

318
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,759
about the stinkiness of nature where

319
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,740
where the plant basically only has a

320
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,929
limited number of chemical precursors

321
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,210
from which to make these compounds of

322
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:47,250
interest and if you skewed the plant

323
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:50,009
towards cannabinoids which have no

324
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:53,179
flavor or aroma then you're sacrificing

325
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:55,830
something and I remember the great

326
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:59,250
Hawaiian strange like Kona gold in the

327
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,620
70s that probably tested around 1012

328
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,909
percent but it literally was one of

329
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,980
those things where you opened a bag and

330
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:07,079
you could smell it a block away it

331
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,539
smelled like a Christmas tree and that

332
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,310
that kind of terpene profile has become

333
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,000
rather scarce these days those Christmas

334
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:16,799
tree the altar of roadkill skunk that

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,220
we're in the case of skunk you probably

336
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,229
have a some kind of

337
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:27,570
sulfur molecule a sequester in there as

338
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:29,129
a precursor to coenzyme a and that's

339
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,440
part of the process of making these

340
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:34,039
chemicals and a little bit hangs out it

341
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,060
really reeks and

342
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:38,039
just one more thing if I can get a

343
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:39,439
little bit do a little bit of math this

344
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:41,849
morning

345
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,620
we test for the Emerald cup every year

346
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,930
we have since we opened and it's a

347
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,909
really great kind of testbed before in

348
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:49,079
the Northern California market and you

349
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:51,029
would get a lot of unique strains it's

350
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,600
not just 20 different flavors of OG I

351
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:57,470
mean last year we had you know 450 500

352
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,290
flower entries and if you graph the

353
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:03,240
winners the top 25 samples and in the

354
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:05,009
testing the way they do the testing

355
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,740
there they do a great job of actually

356
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:09,720
testing each strain and they get a

357
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,430
really good panel of experts to do the

358
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,310
testing in if you graph the the THC

359
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:16,949
content of the overall population of

360
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:19,289
Navarone cup samples versus the winners

361
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,329
versus the overall population of samples

362
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:23,189
we see in the lab they're all the same

363
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,528
the mean is the same so what that means

364
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,360
is

365
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:30,299
the amount of THC has no oh come on

366
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,490
whether a sample is judged or our entry

367
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:34,588
is judged better than another the winner

368
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,089
never has the highest THC and the

369
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:39,470
Emerald Cup since we've been testing out

370
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,470
one of the judges emerald-cut

371
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:45,659
the highest THC that year was number 20

372
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,850
but but if you if you graph the chirping

373
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:49,350
content of the winners versus the

374
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,540
chirping content of the overall

375
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,550
population the chirping content the

376
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:56,039
winners is one full standard deviation

377
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:58,109
higher than the chirping content so you

378
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:59,309
see all these bell curves lined up are

379
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,829
these distributions line up with each

380
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:03,479
other with them with with THC content

381
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:05,309
but then you graph chirping content and

382
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,589
the winners are way over here and the

383
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:10,289
top 20 the top 20 SERP themselves out

384
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:12,110
just rise to the top is so obvious and

385
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:14,099
the judges in the ammo cup it's a

386
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,139
phenomenal amount of agreement about

387
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,199
what are the top 20 it's pretty it's

388
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,480
truly amazing actually

389
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:25,229
well I can I can talk to what it used to

390
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,420
be also I actually had about 200 land

391
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:30,629
raises back in the 70s early 80s and

392
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,429
lost them all one in the fortunate legal

393
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:35,578
thing

394
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:39,448
but I donated nine land races to the

395
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:40,979
University of Mississippi in 1977 to get

396
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:43,019
them started because they had heard

397
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,970
about this such potent marijuana out in

398
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,769
California and they hadn't been testing

399
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,829
any

400
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:53,820
but the two things that came up one is

401
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:56,250
about the skunk at that time I was being

402
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,470
visited because I had books out by

403
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,120
growers from around the country and a

404
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,310
lot of them at that time you had the

405
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,240
hippie hashish trail

406
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:08,250
we're hippies would go through

407
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,709
Afghanistan in Nepal and Lebanon and and

408
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,389
bring back seeds it wasn't the political

409
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:14,099
situation you would have now or that's

410
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:17,429
very dangerous

411
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,019
and we would trade seeds and a lot of

412
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:22,049
the seeds that they they were using

413
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:24,959
especially in the East were short season

414
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:27,179
Afghan ease and these Afghan ease

415
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,809
smelled like skunk a lot of them did I

416
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:33,449
mean like a skunk the problem was is

417
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:36,689
that all we had then we didn't have labs

418
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:40,370
we had smoke testing and they didn't get

419
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:42,690
your very stoned and we now know

420
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,328
looking back that that's because they

421
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,089
had a lot of CBD in them also all right

422
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:50,939
so unfortunately that small group of us

423
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:52,890
who are breeding at that time we

424
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,690
basically got rid of all the CBD plants

425
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:56,059
right and that's why it's been so hard

426
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,740
to bring those back

427
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:00,689
so that was an unfortunate consequence

428
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:05,480
of the illegality and the lack of lab

429
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:08,370
testing but in speaking of the terpenes

430
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,500
when I started to grow some of these

431
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:11,659
popular varieties here I actually

432
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,298
thought

433
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,308
that the lack of fragrance was due to

434
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:19,650
the consequence of old age and I was

435
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:24,088
losing my sense of smell because the

436
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:26,459
smells was so weak because I I got Dave

437
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:29,759
Watson was one of the breeders he

438
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:32,308
brought skunk number one and haze to

439
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,440
Amsterdam along with two varieties that

440
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:36,210
I had which was Afghani one and Durban

441
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,400
poison they along with one another one

442
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:41,009
Hindu cush he brought those two camps at

443
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,019
him and started that basically that

444
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,298
started the entire seed industry out of

445
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:48,058
EMC Dale

446
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:51,029
but anyway he had given me a South

447
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:52,529
Indian strain that was so sweet when I

448
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,660
walked into my greenhouse I almost

449
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:57,899
wanted to bite it I mean it was that

450
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,880
overwhelming and and there were other

451
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,860
strains also that was just really

452
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,410
incredible in terms of fragrance I had a

453
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:05,849
cross between an Afghani and the Durban

454
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,190
that I've never smelled anything like it

455
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:10,139
since and these were things that you

456
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,548
could literally just walk into the the

457
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,220
greenhouse to say oh my god this is

458
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:17,210
overwhelming and a lot of that has

459
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:20,819
definitely been lost now fortunately

460
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:23,190
the emphasis now is totally on terpenes

461
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:25,558
I mean that's all I based my breeding on

462
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,190
now is is really the fragrance the

463
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,500
fragrance and the taste

464
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,870
because once you get up into the teens

465
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,259
really it makes little difference

466
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:36,729
whether you're a 20 or you're 15 right

467
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:41,279
one other thing about the potency back

468
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:43,509
then now the reason why I gave these

469
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,930
strains to the University of Mississippi

470
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:50,049
or the government wasn't necessarily

471
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:53,460
altruistic I I wanted to get the an

472
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:57,009
actual lab result which I did get and

473
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,650
someone tested almost 12 percent now

474
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:02,079
that doesn't sound high now but when you

475
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,960
consider what my sampling was what I was

476
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,629
giving them were lower buds that were

477
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,390
fully seated and not manicured and I'm

478
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,860
sure they tested in the high teens the

479
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,380
sense of me I had at the top of the

480
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,849
plant so I mean I think this is kind of

481
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,510
mythical that there was nothing really

482
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:21,509
strong back then

483
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:21,509
so

484
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:30,220
when I think backwards and I hear from

485
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:32,349
other people they've definitely

486
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,360
mentioned how we've lost a lot of

487
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:36,009
varieties where's the Acapulco gold

488
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:37,689
where's the Colombian red where are the

489
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:40,599
things that made me feel like they did

490
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,549
back in the 60s and 70s and I think

491
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:45,549
we've unfortunately had a bit of

492
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:47,919
unnatural selection and trying to select

493
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:50,349
against those types of plants that would

494
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,720
smell very effervescent and strong and

495
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:54,429
alert the neighbor or the authorities or

496
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,130
someone else and we've definitely been

497
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:59,500
selecting against that for rapid highs

498
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,270
and very different types of profiles

499
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,400
than what we might see otherwise I mean

500
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:05,829
you look at John McPartland work and

501
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,480
what he's done across the entire history

502
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,789
of saying where cannabis may have

503
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,370
evolved from how it's been spread across

504
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:14,710
the globe and what we see today is very

505
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:17,019
tight genetic constriction inside of at

506
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,670
least the western United States even

507
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:20,349
over in the Netherlands we can see from

508
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,000
their terpene profiling that they've got

509
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:24,399
a lot of different varieties that we

510
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,349
don't have over here so I'm hopeful that

511
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,150
when looking back we can actually try

512
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:31,269
and guide some of the breeding today

513
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:33,790
like Mel was saying using advanced

514
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:35,650
techniques and analytical approaches to

515
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:37,029
say let's create different terpene

516
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,310
profiles let's create different

517
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,259
cannabinoids profiles and let's maximize

518
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:43,179
the diversity of what we're seeing

519
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:46,029
instead of restricting it like we have

520
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,710
so far up to today so I'm kind of

521
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:50,470
hopeful and looking backwards we may

522
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,509
have temporarily only lost them it's a

523
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,069
flexible plan we know that if we bread

524
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:56,829
this way maybe we can start breeding

525
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:58,029
backwards and capture a lot of those and

526
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,710
I'm hoping that you know we can

527
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:01,889
accelerate that using advanced

528
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,059
techniques in the laboratory

529
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,820
yeah that's a great point thanks Jeff

530
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:10,470
yeah I think that's not this idea it is

531
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:13,829
really really fundamental is is that a

532
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:17,799
lot of people will walk into a

533
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:21,699
dispensary that lists potency and kind

534
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:23,680
of mentally grade the board based on THC

535
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,960
content and I think the message that

536
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,970
we'll try to convey pretty consistently

537
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,460
across the board today is this that

538
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,110
there really is a lot more to it a lot

539
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,380
of a segment embrace this idea of

540
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:37,299
terpene chemistry as being a fundamental

541
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,030
part of that but I guarantee you there's

542
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:42,730
a lot more to the chemistry than you

543
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:45,670
might imagine a friend of mine Matt wall

544
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:48,039
in England does functional magnetic

545
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,620
resonance imaging of the human brain and

546
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:54,069
he recently did a study of cannabis

547
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:55,629
users while they were on campus and and

548
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:59,099
he found something really really

549
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:01,930
interesting in the last six years

550
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:06,429
neuroscientists have discovered that our

551
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:09,400
brain is a bunch of modules and those

552
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:11,680
modules work together in networks and

553
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,150
there are three principal networks

554
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,920
there's the executive control Network

555
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:20,140
I'm gonna do this there's the the

556
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,940
default mode which is daydreaming

557
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,440
thinking about your past thinking about

558
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,150
the future and it's funny that it's

559
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,850
called default mode because it's where

560
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,960
we spend most of our time

561
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:31,569
what I'm gonna have for lunch today

562
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,000
whatever records yesterday what am I

563
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:36,279
gonna call my mom and all that stuff and

564
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,319
then there's the salience network and

565
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:40,829
the salience network is really really

566
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:44,049
important to cannabis users

567
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:47,019
salient what's important what is salient

568
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:50,109
you know and so what it does is it looks

569
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:52,889
at all the sensory inputs we have and it

570
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:55,799
assigns important to them now if you've

571
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:58,650
ever gotten paranoid on cannabis you can

572
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:00,480
see that THC can interfere with your

573
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,519
salience network because suddenly you

574
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,349
think that that thing at the door could

575
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:07,049
be

576
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:09,809
fill in the blank okay what's really

577
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:12,329
fascinating is is that when Matt was

578
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:16,639
doing these studies when people were on

579
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:19,439
THC cannabis alone Jack Herer

580
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,580
they they really had salience problems

581
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,320
and they can have paranoia and they

582
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:24,990
could have dysphoric reactions all this

583
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:29,819
and when they were on THC and CBD

584
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:31,789
together even a small amount of CBD they

585
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:34,009
still showed all of the kind of

586
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:37,980
psychoactive

587
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:39,720
impairment associated with THC but they

588
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,390
had no problems with their salient

589
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,549
network at all there's their ability to

590
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,500
distinguish what was a threat what was

591
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:48,930
important etc etc in their environment

592
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,309
um didn't change that's really important

593
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:52,380
because there's evidence coming out of

594
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:55,679
Australia England and the US right now

595
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,990
that maybe a tiny tiny CBD buffer might

596
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,779
be a really really smart thing to have

597
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,279
in your cannabis diet alright and and

598
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,349
there's a reason that all of these great

599
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,299
hash countries around the world when

600
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:09,059
it's grown as a field crop you end up

601
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:12,000
with a considerably higher titer of CBD

602
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:14,429
in your resin than when you're just

603
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,289
singly selecting plants for potency

604
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:19,080
which have a tendency to skew the

605
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,859
population towards THC content so I'm

606
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,960
going to talk a little bit about the

607
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:23,819
future right now I want to ask you what

608
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,380
in the last couple of years as far as

609
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:27,149
the evolution of cannabis have you been

610
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,220
most excited about and what have you

611
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,620
seen either in your garden or your

612
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,269
laboratory or your life that really has

613
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:36,359
gotten you kind of excited about where

614
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:38,579
cannabis is going right now okay I want

615
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,579
to bring the TA the CBD thing also

616
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:43,559
because you said though that we kind of

617
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:44,849
lost the CBD thing and we did for a long

618
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,519
while and then it became kind of the

619
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:49,139
Holy Grail and now we've got it back and

620
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,569
you could say we some people are

621
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,390
reporting what 20 percent CBD and so on

622
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:58,529
but the research is showing that all the

623
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:01,560
different healing aspects of the can of

624
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:04,349
plan are a function of all the different

625
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,720
400 least elements and we call out the

626
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:08,969
entourage effect the totality of it and

627
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,610
that's why I extractions don't really

628
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,710
know I mean this sense of sin that

629
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:15,209
Sabbath anyway the synthesizing a

630
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,950
singular molecule or something like that

631
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,200
to say this it's not really working

632
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,509
because it's the whole plant that really

633
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,600
does it now we've got the CBD back I've

634
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:26,789
got CBD plants that and the people who

635
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,289
brought Harlequin from from Switzerland

636
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,599
and he's a good friend of mine and so on

637
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:32,970
so now the genetics it's happening

638
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:36,149
that's the future right now in the

639
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,950
growing world and the genetics is

640
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,930
happening up in Mendocino County I use

641
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,940
seeds that all come from my area with

642
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,140
young guys who are crossing this and

643
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,450
they've been doing it since they're 12

644
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,220
years old and they're master geneticists

645
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:50,279
and they're creating some wonderful new

646
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,490
strains with amazing terpene profiles as

647
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:55,789
well so that's that's and the other part

648
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,870
about future in farming is that

649
00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:00,480
particularly in the Emerald triangle

650
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:03,109
Mendocino County and so on there's a

651
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,539
whole movement towards either

652
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:08,759
biodynamic gardening or

653
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:11,279
by a pro diet probiotic gardening and

654
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:14,279
things of nature where you're using only

655
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,710
natural ingredients and also going more

656
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,690
towards sustainability so that having

657
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,640
fewer and fewer things come off your

658
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,470
ranch to grow your plants that you grow

659
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,900
your plants you know with a better with

660
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:27,690
with plant material that using compost

661
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,210
teas using Bokashi fermentation things

662
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,720
and you're using ways to make the soil

663
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:35,190
come alive that the soil is actually

664
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,680
biologically and fungicide fungally

665
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,420
alive and that's what grows your plants

666
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,759
and that's what actually is the best way

667
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,009
to grow cannabis in the most natural way

668
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,440
that we recreate the conditions that are

669
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:47,920
in in the forest and in nature and not

670
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,849
putting other attitude

671
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,849
[Applause]

672
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:57,869
and in what we're seeing too I think

673
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:59,099
along those same lines is cannabis is

674
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:01,439
going to be a really interesting kind of

675
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,199
I guess test bet because it is you know

676
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,028
essentially until we get directives on

677
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,159
from the EPA and whatnot about which

678
00:27:06,028 --> 00:27:09,898
pesticides can be used on cannabis we

679
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,639
can't use can pesticides in cannabis

680
00:27:09,898 --> 00:27:13,469
that's gonna be one of the only crops I

681
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:15,479
know where you're gonna have a total

682
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,649
restriction on or at least supposedly

683
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,589
you have a total restriction on

684
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:20,939
pesticide use should be and exactly and

685
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:22,798
it really should be two because we're

686
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,288
not eating it cannabis we can't wash it

687
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,668
off so it'll be interesting to see that

688
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:28,230
and I think some of the things I'm

689
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:30,179
excited about too is is you know one

690
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,778
again you know I'm sad to see the kind

691
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:35,100
of the culture kind of get get faded

692
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,480
away maybe a little bit it is

693
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,519
interesting for me to see some of these

694
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,889
people come in who actually can can

695
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:42,569
invest money in cannabis and who can in

696
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:45,658
and you can do it safely and confess

697
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:47,788
money on creating new new cannabis based

698
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,500
products infused products I'm

699
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:50,788
old-fashioned I like to smoke my joints

700
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,288
but it's really cool to see some of the

701
00:27:50,788 --> 00:27:54,538
things we're doing with concentrates

702
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:56,369
with infused products for people with

703
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:58,980
medical conditions we're making products

704
00:27:56,369 --> 00:28:00,989
that that look more like medical

705
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,819
products that that use this natural

706
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,319
plant-based medicine but deliver it in a

707
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:05,849
way that's that's efficacious for

708
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,278
someone for people with different

709
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:10,278
diseases we're starting to specialize

710
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:13,169
those products for people with specific

711
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:15,058
ailments and and so that's that's been

712
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:17,220
really cool to see is just kind of once

713
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:19,349
we can actually safely put some research

714
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,538
dollars into cannabis what's coming from

715
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:22,829
that and it's been that's been really

716
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:24,148
exciting I think one of the things

717
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:25,949
that's really compelling too is this

718
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:27,109
idea that I'm Kevin mckernon who works

719
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:29,490
for a company called

720
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:31,308
quarter turn on the East Coast

721
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,538
he's been

722
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:35,519
sequencing the canvas genome for a while

723
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:37,619
with other groups around the United

724
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,128
States but what he's also been doing is

725
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:42,869
sequencing the microbiome of the plant

726
00:28:41,128 --> 00:28:44,699
in other words what grows on the plant

727
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:47,428
what bacteria grow on the plant because

728
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,778
there's a single network alright you

729
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:50,759
know we've always said oh there's a soil

730
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:53,519
web there's this and that there's hard

731
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,110
core science now that you're terpene

732
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,829
expression on your plan is going to be

733
00:28:55,109 --> 00:29:01,138
highly driven by the microbial life on

734
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:03,778
your plant now that's interesting

735
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:06,058
because right now certain jurisdictions

736
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:08,038
are rushing out saying oh torille total

737
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:10,648
aerobic count is really important no it

738
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,628
isn't it isn't at all it's like saying

739
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:15,329
Oh total aerobic count in your yogurt

740
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:17,368
could kill you okay no it's pathogens

741
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:19,739
all right we have to build a distinguish

742
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:22,618
between healthy bacteria and pathogens

743
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:24,479
on our plants and if we can't we're not

744
00:29:22,618 --> 00:29:26,638
going to know what's safe and what's not

745
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:28,288
safe and the thing is is that when

746
00:29:26,638 --> 00:29:30,689
regulators come in and try to regulate

747
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:32,819
us they really need to help them

748
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,619
understand what's important in the plant

749
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:37,200
because I guarantee you they are not

750
00:29:34,618 --> 00:29:38,699
going to figure it out themselves okay

751
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,269
there you're gonna have to spoon-feed

752
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,419
them like like a slightly slow four year

753
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:44,419
old

754
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:50,970
well a couple of things I completely

755
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:54,179
agree with the Swami and in terms of

756
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:57,960
organic growing I grow organically in

757
00:29:54,179 --> 00:30:00,979
Los Angeles here I use two things I use

758
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:05,369
BT which is a Mozilla's thuringiensis

759
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:08,519
which is used to naturally kill bug

760
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:10,259
worms and they are a plague here the

761
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,210
second thing I use is I use tanglefoot

762
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:14,639
which I put on the is the sticky

763
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,259
substance that put it on the stem if

764
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:18,508
that prevents crawlers from coming up

765
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:20,970
and now than that is just me going out

766
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:24,179
there looking at my plants and pulling

767
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,788
off anything that's got in an infection

768
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:29,639
let's say

769
00:30:25,788 --> 00:30:31,710
you know by some sort of bug and just to

770
00:30:29,638 --> 00:30:33,748
keep the population down I know that

771
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,190
there's always going to be some sort of

772
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,690
insect out there there's always going to

773
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,489
be grasshoppers or something else that

774
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,278
are you eating it but I'll just go out

775
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:42,778
there and pick off what I can and that

776
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,598
way there I know that whatever I'm

777
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:47,398
smoking is absolutely you know clean of

778
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:49,408
any pesticides or anything else and I

779
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:53,908
think that's the way it should be grown

780
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:56,970
and it leads into this market of indoor

781
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:58,859
growing where an awful lot of pendous

782
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,229
pesticides and fungicides and everything

783
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:04,038
else are used and one of the the main

784
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:06,598
things that should be done with this

785
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:08,669
the evolution of cannabis on the

786
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:11,368
development of strains is the

787
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:13,139
development of resistance names through

788
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:16,089
things like bus riders for the outdoor

789
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:17,799
grow and for how do you mildew for the

790
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:19,629
indoor crow is that sort of thing and

791
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:22,750
now that we're finally going to be able

792
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:25,660
to grow you know vast fields of this and

793
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:27,490
actually see what is it has a natural

794
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,980
resistance to it these things are going

795
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:31,960
to come about because so far they

796
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,809
haven't in that's due to the illegality

797
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,460
and and the inability to grow a massive

798
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,009
amount of plants and find those unique

799
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,470
plants that have a natural resistance

800
00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:43,210
now I just want to one other thing and

801
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:46,539
that is I've been able to witness

802
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:49,930
something in that I know exactly what

803
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:52,480
the Afghani one looked like back in 1979

804
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:55,380
that came from coupled to a land race

805
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:59,890
and the Durbin poison came from Durbin

806
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:03,070
another land race and I recently

807
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,920
acquired a couple years ago a couple of

808
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:08,439
phenotypes of German poison which is

809
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,080
nothing like the Durbin poison that went

810
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,440
from me over to Amsterdam the one now is

811
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:17,319
a much heavier producer it still has the

812
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,110
early flowering quality to it it doesn't

813
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:22,240
have any of the smell that that mine had

814
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:24,039
and and most importantly and

815
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,620
disheartening to me is that it doesn't

816
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:28,149
have

817
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:30,939
the coloration and the stigmas that I

818
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:34,330
saw in that variety that that that

819
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:36,009
strain that strain had purple stigma

820
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:40,269
stigma so the little white hairs that

821
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:42,369
most you probably call pistols and or a

822
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:44,230
lavender lavender purple I've never seen

823
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:45,939
in any other strain and I was

824
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,400
disheartened to see that it wasn't in

825
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:53,320
this drain anymore and the other was at

826
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:56,980
Guinea one Afghani one I got from my

827
00:32:53,319 --> 00:33:00,609
original source so it's about filial

828
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:03,130
generation 37 now and that also that had

829
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:05,889
red stigmas it had bred sting comes in

830
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,510
and had white stigmas and the three

831
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,250
females that I grew this year all had

832
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:11,440
white stigmas and when I asked her about

833
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,480
red singlet she said she she couldn't

834
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,600
remember seeing them so she lost that

835
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,920
quite a long time ago she also also lost

836
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:20,019
a lot of the flavor over the year and

837
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,640
that was pretty much a natural thing

838
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:24,579
because she wasn't a selective breed or

839
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:27,100
she just picked out a few females and a

840
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:28,569
few males and just let them go

841
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:30,579
so it was interesting to see what

842
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:32,288
happened to those things one from

843
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:34,389
selective breeding by Dutch breeders and

844
00:33:32,288 --> 00:33:36,900
the other by just you know reading the

845
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,900
pollination

846
00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:43,200
perhaps what I'm most interested in

847
00:33:40,538 --> 00:33:45,339
seeing as we now enter

848
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,259
legalization also you know

849
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:48,788
standardization should be the next part

850
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,950
of that so now that we're able to grow

851
00:33:48,788 --> 00:33:53,558
and cultivate under license we're not

852
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,419
fearful of someone coming in and raiding

853
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,849
the plants or taking things away from us

854
00:33:55,419 --> 00:34:00,610
we can invest in infrastructure that

855
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:02,980
will allow us to produce in a much more

856
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:05,408
consistent reliable and standardized

857
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:08,079
fashion so that every single harvest

858
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:09,669
every single crop has the exact same can

859
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,190
I have a node and terpene profile as it

860
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:13,690
did the first time that you did it so we

861
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,240
can see consistently in the lab

862
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,099
currently that that is not the case it

863
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,928
is drifting around quite a bit it is

864
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:22,179
exceptionally difficult next to

865
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,918
impossible to create medicine if it's

866
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:26,200
not standardized under those types of

867
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,579
conditions and with capital coming in we

868
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,069
can invest in the right infrastructure

869
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:32,469
and put down greenhouse technologies

870
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,940
other types of sophisticated farming

871
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:36,128
technologies that exist in other

872
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,648
industries utilize those tools to become

873
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:41,199
very efficient effective at producing

874
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:43,509
standardized consistent product we'll be

875
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,579
able to take that cultivated product and

876
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:48,100
marry it towards other types of

877
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:50,259
technologies such as pharmaceutical

878
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:52,599
technologies delivery devices other

879
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:55,060
advanced processing methodologies and

880
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,269
really create the next wave of products

881
00:34:55,059 --> 00:35:00,489
that will deliver much more beneficial

882
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:03,639
therapeutic effects at a consistent rate

883
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:05,379
across a wide range of ailments I think

884
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:07,299
we've all seen that cannabis can touch

885
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,490
many different types of ailments many

886
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,720
different types of people can benefit

887
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:12,519
but we never know which one we're

888
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,399
getting we never know which composition

889
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,929
is going to help us and when this age is

890
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,849
where we're going to now start to be

891
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:20,858
able to see I know exactly what I

892
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:22,779
started with I know how I handled it I

893
00:35:20,858 --> 00:35:25,000
know how I put it in my product form at

894
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,800
the end and now I can deliver and

895
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,719
consistently deliver that type of

896
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,210
response for patients who are looking

897
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,279
for it and not only does that benefit

898
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:35,409
patients but it also benefits the adult

899
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,780
users who may not want to feel sleepy at

900
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:40,059
the concert right so they were going to

901
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,830
also want to pick their specific you

902
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:43,360
know product and product types and I

903
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:45,279
think we're just starting to see this

904
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,590
age come about and to me that's some of

905
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,240
the the most interesting aspects in

906
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,920
addition to different cannabinoids

907
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:52,929
showing up different ratios of

908
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,610
cannabinoids and different terpene

909
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:57,279
profiles we'll be able to capture that

910
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:59,260
and keep them consistently to me that's

911
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,880
some of the most exciting aspects of the

912
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,380
the future that we're all creating here

913
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,670
yeah that's a good point and I think

914
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,380
that the other thing too is is that

915
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,630
there's this kind of one-size-fits-all

916
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,910
where we were kind of fooled ourselves

917
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,309
into believing that every plant will

918
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:14,589
grow the same way every place you grow

919
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:16,029
it and the truth is is that one thing

920
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,519
that we've noticed around the world is

921
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:20,560
is that cannabis plants get very very

922
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:23,139
interesting when they get acclimated to

923
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:26,049
particular environment and what we're

924
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:27,789
seeing right now is is that I would say

925
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,130
and not to insult my friends up north

926
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:32,769
because they're the best cannabis is

927
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,750
grown in California right there but what

928
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:37,210
we're seeing right now is we're seeing

929
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,400
people trying to grow tropical strains

930
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:42,519
you know in the in the mountains of

931
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,760
Trinity alright and are trying to get

932
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:47,619
you know of basically strains that were

933
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,440
developed for the Afghani mountains and

934
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:53,109
grow them in Hawaii and the thing is the

935
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,500
plant will adjust but I think we have to

936
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:58,240
really look at what's a local string and

937
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,699
let some of these landraces have a

938
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,079
chance to re-emerge and I think that

939
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:03,579
that's going to I mean I think it's

940
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,860
gonna be really really fascinating in

941
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:08,710
California to see what happens in the

942
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:12,099
macadamia nut belt okay where you could

943
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:13,449
truly grow these late flowering time

944
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:15,059
Hayes's and some of the things that we

945
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:19,169
haven't seen they're really a long time

946
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:21,579
can I talk to that too it's a strange

947
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,548
Jeff there's the thing that you're

948
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:25,798
talking about is the Stan nation for

949
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:29,400
medical purposes and I applaud that 100%

950
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:30,780
but as we get now away from the strictly

951
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,430
we had to talk about it's always

952
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,319
medicine right we know it's medicine but

953
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:36,358
now we're also talking about the

954
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,009
inspirational market and that

955
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:41,519
inspirational market which will be

956
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:44,190
approved by Prop 64 that is going to be

957
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,858
where you have your fine human Sekar or

958
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,690
you have your your top shelf $80 bottle

959
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:51,179
of wine and those are going to be

960
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,380
artisanal grows that are going to be in

961
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:53,699
nature and they're going to have

962
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,920
variation they're going to have

963
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:58,649
fluctuations and if you think about wine

964
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,960
for example the same vineyard has the

965
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:04,650
same vines year after year in the same

966
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,500
soil but you don't expect 1979 to be the

967
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,930
same as 1984 from any wine strain right

968
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,969
now if we're growing from seeds why

969
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:13,798
would you expect her seeds to express

970
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:16,169
themselves the same way they did last

971
00:38:13,798 --> 00:38:17,969
year when the climate is different and

972
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,409
in fact the seeds different even though

973
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:21,598
we know the strain is trying we're

974
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:23,308
trying to breathe true for the strain so

975
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,338
I think that there's also going to be a

976
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:27,380
market for that really high-end totally

977
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:30,539
unique

978
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,950
small-batch artisanal grown that is

979
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:33,779
going to be you know it's going to cost

980
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:35,669
you because it's going to cost that

981
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,130
farmer a lot of that time and effort to

982
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,559
make that and I guess that's where we're

983
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:42,390
positioning ourselves to put first

984
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,910
appearance medicine out there for people

985
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:47,308
but also the most unique kind of

986
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:48,838
spiritual inspirational high and that's

987
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:50,880
where I think there's going to be that

988
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:53,460
high-end market although you will be

989
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,809
developing if the answers on both sides

990
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,449
of this which is the u.s.

991
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:58,380
standardization when we need

992
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:59,848
standardization but we also need the

993
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,068
artistic expression that comes with

994
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:04,170
craft and the thing is is that wine

995
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:06,298
makers and beer makers have really taken

996
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:09,180
the lead in this in a commercial sense

997
00:39:06,298 --> 00:39:10,798
and and cannabis breeders and growers

998
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:12,690
have done it in an underground sense for

999
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:14,608
a long time and having them be able to

1000
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,019
step into the light and I mean I was

1001
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:17,578
talking to Dave Watson a few weeks ago

1002
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:19,199
and he was talking about yeah I'm gonna

1003
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:20,730
grow seventy thousand hazen seeds out

1004
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,009
and i'm gonna find twelve plants i

1005
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,199
really like alright and i hear that

1006
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:27,180
bitches may tomorrow that's what Luther

1007
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,308
Burbank used to do grow a whole field it

1008
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:32,039
takes me out I mean it's just I mean

1009
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:34,609
like having a bee Dave Watson pick the

1010
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:38,179
best 12 it's on a seventy thousand

1011
00:39:34,608 --> 00:39:41,139
that's me sounds like like that's the

1012
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:43,879
world I want to live it so

1013
00:39:41,139 --> 00:39:47,358
yeah yeah that's a dream come true yeah

1014
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,950
that's a sack come true so let's talk

1015
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,328
about

1016
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:52,189
technology and in what kind of

1017
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:54,200
technologies you're kind of that we have

1018
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,818
right now but also technologies that are

1019
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,048
kind of emerging right now there's some

1020
00:39:55,818 --> 00:39:58,608
really interesting things out there

1021
00:39:57,048 --> 00:40:01,630
right now that I think are kind of

1022
00:39:58,608 --> 00:40:05,048
fascinating to me I think that

1023
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:08,750
vaporizers today will be looked upon

1024
00:40:05,048 --> 00:40:10,608
like tube radios are to somebody who's

1025
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:13,219
using a state-of-the-art laser projector

1026
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:15,469
and that is but but at the same time

1027
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:17,179
tubes have their place that ask any

1028
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:19,368
audio file I think there's going to be

1029
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:21,710
this interesting mix of of kind of new

1030
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:23,358
and old technologies in service of this

1031
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,220
plant and I think there are some really

1032
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:26,509
interesting technologies emerging and if

1033
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:28,759
anybody want to talk about some of the

1034
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,250
ones that they find intriguing well

1035
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,650
it'll it'll be a very interesting

1036
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,239
marriage of hardware and software so

1037
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,759
much like you've seen your iPhone evolve

1038
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:39,679
you're gonna see electronic cigarettes

1039
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:41,088
or other delivery devices evolve that

1040
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,460
hardware is definitely going to evolve

1041
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:45,048
and we're gonna make the concentrates

1042
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,150
and the software that's kind of going

1043
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:49,460
inside of them evolve along with it so

1044
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:51,019
we're starting to see compositions that

1045
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,909
are improved and people including

1046
00:40:51,018 --> 00:40:55,219
terpenes in different ways so that's a

1047
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:57,500
vast improvement from what we had seen

1048
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:59,929
before we're seeing very different

1049
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,690
hardware technologies certainly a lot of

1050
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:04,429
people gearing up towards making

1051
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:06,380
exceptionally new ones that have very

1052
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:08,449
different types of compositions in terms

1053
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,460
of internal mechanisms of how they work

1054
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:12,199
how fast they may turn on what they

1055
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,778
deliver as opposed to when this first

1056
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:17,028
started a number of years ago and I

1057
00:41:14,778 --> 00:41:18,920
think we may even see adaption of some

1058
00:41:17,028 --> 00:41:22,400
of the pharmaceutical delivery devices

1059
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,889
also being utilized in this space so I'm

1060
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,568
I I think that it is a pretty exciting

1061
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:28,278
endeavor we're gonna see like you said

1062
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,960
there's a lot of people that will say I

1063
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:31,940
still trust the old stuff that was right

1064
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,380
for me but we'll see a very rapid

1065
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,809
evolution over the next two to three

1066
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,460
years I believe in seeing very different

1067
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:39,289
types of hardware come out and hopefully

1068
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,509
there'll be improved for both

1069
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:43,220
composition and safety we'll be able to

1070
00:41:41,509 --> 00:41:44,900
study them to say they're delivering

1071
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:46,849
consistently because then I think you

1072
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,680
can really roll on that product being

1073
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:50,960
delivering the exact response every

1074
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:53,119
single time that you wanted and we'll

1075
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,420
also see other delivery technologies in

1076
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,309
terms of patches oral consumption and a

1077
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,170
lot of ways of very you know varying

1078
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:03,039
what types of molecules are delivered to

1079
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,039
me and when

1080
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,970
so it's an interesting time because I

1081
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:09,980
think what you're seeing is you're

1082
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:11,449
seeing companies like I'm psyche coming

1083
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,820
out of Israel right now that says they

1084
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:17,000
can deliver like a cartridge that

1085
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:20,539
delivers exactly the same microgram dose

1086
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,420
of a cannabinoid terpenoid entourage to

1087
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:24,619
the patient every time

1088
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:27,700
when you ask it well how do you do that

1089
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:29,529
well it's a secret processing technique

1090
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:31,549
and

1091
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:33,560
there's a lot of hype out there too but

1092
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:36,710
I think what it is is it is that you

1093
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:39,980
know I still haven't found a vaporizer

1094
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:42,829
that can actually top the taste of my

1095
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,590
technique with a pipe and so I want to

1096
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:46,699
see that happening in vapor Isis I want

1097
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,500
to see somebody be able to deliver a

1098
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:51,169
terpene entourage in a way that's really

1099
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,139
great because right now for me a lot of

1100
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:56,539
these Terp tout concentrates in these ii

1101
00:42:54,139 --> 00:43:00,349
pens it's the difference between crystal

1102
00:42:56,539 --> 00:43:01,730
light and real lemonade okay where it

1103
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:04,009
tastes like oh yeah yeah that tastes

1104
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,889
about as much like grape juice as grape

1105
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:08,230
kool-aid does and and what does it say

1106
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:11,900
oh it's cush

1107
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:14,240
so anyway but I also one thing about the

1108
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,880
vape pens let's not forget that they are

1109
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,409
landfill and the whole sort of you know

1110
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,180
some of them are better than others but

1111
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:22,039
most of those vape pens out there you

1112
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:23,839
use them and you throw them away that's

1113
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:25,670
just one more thing in the trash heap so

1114
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,110
keep that in mind also now there are

1115
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:30,200
other ways to vapor course with the

1116
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:32,660
volcanoes and so on and so forth but you

1117
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:34,969
know I'm such an old hippie I just like

1118
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:37,039
to smoke my joints but the reason I like

1119
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:39,139
to smoke my joints is actually I think

1120
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,329
that the joint is the only way you get

1121
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:43,219
everything and what I mean by that is

1122
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:45,559
when you start out your joint it's at

1123
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:48,439
room temperature and it's already off

1124
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,880
gassing vows to organic terpenes and

1125
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,769
you're taking those in it you can dry

1126
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,930
hit and get a really delightful taste I

1127
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:56,920
recommend that but now as you light it

1128
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:59,389
and that cinder moves through what the

1129
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,700
stuff at the end of the joint at your

1130
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:03,619
mouth that goes from room temperature on

1131
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:05,689
a continuous scale all the way up to

1132
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:07,489
combustion so as the cinder moves

1133
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:10,010
through you are actually getting

1134
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:11,659
everything that's in that cannabis if

1135
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:15,050
you're vaping you got a very limited

1136
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:17,029
temperature range and TAC volatize is at

1137
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:19,070
a different temperature than CBD and

1138
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,240
every other compound has a slightly

1139
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,880
different temperature at which it

1140
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:25,129
vaporizes so if you're smoking a vape

1141
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,099
you're getting two or three maybe a ten

1142
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,840
degree range of thing but if you're

1143
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:31,779
smoking a joint you're getting the whole

1144
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:35,390
thing that's why

1145
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:37,670
by the way by the way see that's what

1146
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:40,299
happens when you go to the top of the

1147
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:43,099
mountain and smoke the joint okay okay

1148
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,620
so so the bottom line is that kind of

1149
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:49,009
insight I guarantee you you won't get

1150
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:50,960
that in a lab but you need to okay okay

1151
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,550
well well in just kind of I think I

1152
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,860
think that kind of speaks to the the

1153
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,600
standardized experience versus unique

1154
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,680
experience situation I think I think

1155
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:59,509
there's a little something for everyone

1156
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,519
that's coming in the future and I think

1157
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:04,370
maybe a lot of these like these pens

1158
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,960
that are more processed or the terpenes

1159
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:07,279
are added back there you go you can have

1160
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,420
your standardized experience you can buy

1161
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,640
you know what you're gonna get every

1162
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,869
time for those people seeking a new

1163
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,179
experience every time a unique

1164
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:17,089
experience chasing that perfect strain

1165
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:18,710
that perfect taste then then you go with

1166
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:21,079
the joint or some of these extracts that

1167
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:23,539
are that are minimally processed that

1168
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:26,090
that also provide a unique experience

1169
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:27,949
and unique flavor the like the rosin

1170
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,110
yeah yeah the way that cannabis was

1171
00:45:27,949 --> 00:45:32,599
growing that season is gonna also come

1172
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:33,740
through in that extract and so I think

1173
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:35,029
there's a little something for everyone

1174
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:37,099
I think and then I think the infused

1175
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:38,240
products absolutely need Standardization

1176
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:39,230
I think if there's one thing you can all

1177
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:40,939
agree on that if you're gonna eat an

1178
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:42,289
edible should know exactly how many

1179
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,630
milligrams that edible is going to

1180
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:46,940
contain because it's gonna hit you hard

1181
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,769
if you get it wrong and any what we see

1182
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,630
is that's where the standard a yet

1183
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:52,699
actually we have growers that come

1184
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,260
through and test every batch with us and

1185
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:56,989
they're growing the same strain and if

1186
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,790
it's off point five percent one one girl

1187
00:45:56,989 --> 00:46:00,689
they're they're calling us up and asking

1188
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:02,489
us to retest it they've got at that

1189
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,500
standardized even outdoor growers or

1190
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:05,489
even even the same strain across a few

1191
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,800
different growers either there's a

1192
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:09,419
couple percentage points variation where

1193
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,010
we see that why this swings are with

1194
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,260
edibles and there's so many edibles out

1195
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:16,170
there or infused products but most of

1196
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,790
the edibles where it's just there's

1197
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,950
certain edible matrices that are almost

1198
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:22,289
impossible to get homogeneous there's

1199
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:24,149
there's you know add well we're you know

1200
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:25,619
beef jerky for gonna infuse beef jerky

1201
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,900
the the jerky itself isn't even the same

1202
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,579
size and so I think I think where we

1203
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,490
would we can all agree that we need to

1204
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:35,400
see standardization and are these

1205
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:37,109
eaten eaten PhD I still have an issue

1206
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,650
with infused beef jerky but that's

1207
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:42,630
another thing either I do think I bet

1208
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,760
I'm also kind of the libertarian side of

1209
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:47,809
me really wants to support the Roulette

1210
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,810
class of edibles

1211
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:53,480
you know you buy your ticket it takes a

1212
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,850
ride you know

1213
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,619
but but but seriously I do pay the

1214
00:46:56,849 --> 00:47:03,000
slimes out that the juice products is

1215
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:05,509
important work yeah we call it becoming

1216
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,900
a cookie casual tub

1217
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:15,560
yeah so one more thing from Jim and

1218
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:18,950
will we're gonna go to questions okay

1219
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:22,380
just following up on what Swami said

1220
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:23,819
the the Pens are fine for convenience

1221
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,650
they're great for traveling that sort of

1222
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,960
thing but my preferred method is smoking

1223
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:30,990
a joint and not smoking a giant blunt

1224
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:34,619
either I like to smoke a regular ol

1225
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:37,139
little joint that I've been growing all

1226
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:40,259
my life and what I've always thought is

1227
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:42,319
that when you're smoking like a blunt

1228
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:45,440
with an enormous amount of

1229
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:48,059
grass in it and you're

1230
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,800
dropping in on that and creating huge

1231
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:51,630
amount of smoke you're really burning

1232
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,150
this stuff you know you're not

1233
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,490
vaporizing it at all because I've always

1234
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:58,500
thought that as you draw on the joint

1235
00:47:56,489 --> 00:48:01,919
what you're really getting is what's

1236
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:04,139
heated before that red-hot coal our

1237
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,090
ember is burning this stuff so it's

1238
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:08,980
really that heating process of slowly

1239
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:10,450
drawing on the joint that gives you

1240
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,980
everything that's really there it gives

1241
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:14,049
you all those dirt beans that are

1242
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:17,380
boiling off at a much lower temperature

1243
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:19,420
than THC and so forth down the line so

1244
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,309
that's why I smoke like that and that's

1245
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,019
because I think that's where you get the

1246
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:25,299
most flavor and absolutely the most

1247
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:27,909
effect of what is in that plan and how

1248
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:30,789
you roll the joint is key - yeah exactly

1249
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:32,829
and I've seen him roll a joint with one

1250
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:36,369
hand on the back of a speeding Ducati

1251
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:37,900
motorcycle okay but but it's also really

1252
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:40,210
important I mean the thing is is it I

1253
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:43,690
mean nothing I've watched people like

1254
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:46,840
Kyle kushman watch somebody incinerate

1255
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:49,929
his creation with like taking the

1256
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:52,390
lighter and going you know and it's it's

1257
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:55,299
ways things where you just want to heat

1258
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:57,549
you want to just kind of liberate this

1259
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,530
this kind of incredible operatic on the

1260
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:01,090
plant and so I couldn't agree more I

1261
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:04,300
mean if there's one big takeaway today

1262
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:06,690
an insight it's it's really take care of

1263
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:09,250
your cannabis in how you're consuming

1264
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:17,139
that is the evolution of

1265
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:17,139
