1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,140
so Sabrina brought up an excellent point

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:08,820
the July first transition so the bureau

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,638
took a lot of heat when we did not

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,469
extend the transition period there was a

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,769
tremendous amount of pressure on us to

6
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:19,890
extend it we did not we did not change

7
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:22,890
our regulations and we did not extend it

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,719
I am one question two questions for the

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,699
panel how did you feel about that

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:31,500
decision and how did it affect your

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:34,109
business operations you know my personal

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,238
feelings about the decision were that I

13
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,829
had been approached by some retail

14
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,399
operators and other operators in

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:45,299
industry to to put my name with those

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,270
who were asking for an extension and for

17
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,159
ourselves as the laboratory an extension

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,840
wasn't really going to be material one

19
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,308
way or another in terms of readiness or

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,199
our execution because we were already

21
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,858
doing what we needed to do for July

22
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,448
first but what I was seeing was that

23
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:02,550
having to do with the inventory that was

24
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:04,618
being held an evaluation of inventory

25
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,750
that was either owned by yourself or by

26
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,790
another party that you were in contract

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,409
with that the particulars around the

28
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,040
ownerships of those inventories and the

29
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,618
date of its production in some cases

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,990
because the deadlines either weren't

31
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,400
understood or anticipated with respect

32
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:21,569
to when things were manufactured or

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,700
harvested and when they could continue

34
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:25,529
to be sold that I became aware of

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,600
certain people who I personally cared

36
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,310
about a lot that we're going to take

37
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,478
enormous losses that could potentially

38
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,579
put them out of business as small

39
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,560
business owners and so as a small

40
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:38,578
business owner entrepreneur I have a lot

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,040
of compassion for those people and I was

42
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:42,509
I was dismayed that they were having

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,689
such a negative impact because I've

44
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,549
known them since my company was founded

45
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,839
eight and a half years ago and to be in

46
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,790
business for eight and a half years or

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,409
ten years and suffer that kind of blow

48
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,770
and you know in one that you really

49
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,180
can't affect and and and maybe if their

50
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:58,319
own responsibility in their own fault

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,460
because they weren't prepared or they

52
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,529
weren't engaged and that may have been

53
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,438
what happened but it was unfortunate

54
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,540
just as from a humanistic perspective it

55
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,859
was unfortunate to watch that happen for

56
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,280
people yeah

57
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,620
I personally I would have liked to see

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:21,020
an extension for all the reasons that

59
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,580
you said the I do wonder though if we

60
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,500
had extended I'm sure this is part of

61
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,180
what inform the decision not to us would

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,330
it have been any different another six

63
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,069
months hence right so personally I would

64
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,390
have liked to see extension an extension

65
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:36,829
because I think that it needs to be a

66
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:38,899
smoother transition from the unregulated

67
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,270
to regulated market from business

68
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,000
perspective though anticipated that it

69
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:48,110
would be held hard and so to that July

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
date so we amped up for it and there was

71
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,730
a lot of market share to be got during

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,680
that period of result and then lastly

73
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:57,349
just you know kind of embarrassed by the

74
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,330
Instagram and social media posts of just

75
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:01,759
all these empty shelves throughout our

76
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,370
state one of the biggest you know

77
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,859
concerns I have is the the lack of

78
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:10,909
dispensaries in our in our market being

79
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:13,040
a supply chain company so I hope to see

80
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:15,049
those shelves filled again and that's

81
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:19,729
robust market so it's a little scary how

82
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:21,379
much of a reset it was yeah I agree I

83
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:24,560
think it would have been delaying the

84
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,689
inevitable if you had just moved it and

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,430
there the reactions would have been the

86
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:33,500
same it I made sure that you know that

87
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,689
the buyers at BPG were in communication

88
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,549
with their vendors to make sure that

89
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:39,560
they were as prepared as they can be and

90
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:42,140
and you know how that communication gets

91
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,689
through and whether it's received on

92
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:47,629
that end I I don't know but I I I think

93
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:49,549
that it it definitely helped to provide

94
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,780
a sort of a process for them because a

95
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,640
lot of them didn't really know what to

96
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,390
do or what was even going on or that

97
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,309
there was even a July first deadline and

98
00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:00,859
you know just to ensure that we did have

99
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,599
enough products and and you know didn't

100
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,060
lose out on any of that and all of the

101
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,459
testing and Berkley's testing standards

102
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,750
have always been extremely high than the

103
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:10,069
highest in the state so most of the

104
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,650
vendors that we worked with were pretty

105
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:15,319
used to you know meeting those rules

106
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,810
anyways so the testing wasn't as much of

107
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,699
an issue as the packaging and labeling

108
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,560
which also kicked off a lot of

109
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:23,629
discussions and arguments but I think

110
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,069
that yeah I mean a better

111
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:27,439
to happen now and to have everybody

112
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:29,480
adjust right now if this is all it's

113
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,339
inevitable and you know we've been

114
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,189
fighting for this for a really long time

115
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:35,719
and here we are so this is what it looks

116
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:39,139
like and I just look at it as growing

117
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,720
pains and you know it's it's really hard

118
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:43,879
to see you know like you said some of

119
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,670
the these own smaller business owners

120
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,310
that just don't have the resources or

121
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,230
the bandwidth to really keep up with all

122
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,259
of these things and and find themselves

123
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,660
in a situation where they're not

124
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,039
completely able to comply to the extent

125
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,140
that they can get their stuff online

126
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,520
right away I think a lot of this is a

127
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,870
very flexible creative industry that has

128
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,759
managed to survive through many

129
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,910
challenges in the past and I think that

130
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,360
that spirit will continue on and people

131
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:18,410
can be innovative and and find a way so

132
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:21,009
I I think it was it was good yeah I

133
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:24,130
would say that despite preparation

134
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:28,430
beginning in June for the July 1st

135
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:30,980
changes the end of that grace period you

136
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:35,449
know flow Cana suffered significantly in

137
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:38,150
early July as we didn't agree with our

138
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:41,120
retail clients on what were the

139
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:43,939
packaging requirements and that was that

140
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,280
was really challenging to not see eye to

141
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:48,500
eye have us all trying to comply but

142
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:52,129
disagree about what the rules said that

143
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,439
was very challenging and at the same

144
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:57,769
time despite the pain that we felt and

145
00:05:54,439 --> 00:06:00,199
what I assume many many companies felt I

146
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:03,139
would say that I still salute the BCC

147
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,800
for not flexing on that because this is

148
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,539
the beginning of the relationship of

149
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,949
there's an open period where we all get

150
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,140
to talk about what the rules should be

151
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,779
and then we will enforce the rules and

152
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,219
so I salute you for enforcing the rules

153
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:20,239
when it was time to enforce the rules

154
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:24,020
and we learned that this is this is a

155
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,519
sort of a weak link situation a weakest

156
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:27,349
link situation in the industry where

157
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,969
those who and we're gonna confront it

158
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:32,390
again in the near future probably when

159
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:35,800
these regs go final we will have those

160
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:38,899
who didn't prepare enough and

161
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,340
businesses will choose oh you're not

162
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,289
prepared I'm not going to do business

163
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:43,789
with you right now and that may be a

164
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,790
make-or-break moment for those who

165
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,950
didn't prepare and yet that is the way

166
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,080
this industry and any industry works

167
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:53,180
you know it's competition and we can

168
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:57,439
seek to out-compete each other on

169
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,120
compliance to the state's benefit and I

170
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,129
think a lot of farmers were kind of

171
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,990
caught off guard I mean granted the

172
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,120
transition period was published but

173
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,480
we're transitioning away from kind of a

174
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,040
bulk flour market so traditionally

175
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,439
cultivators have provided bulk flour

176
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,420
into the retail sector and that's how

177
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,819
it's gone into vending departments so a

178
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,670
lot of cultivators weren't prepared for

179
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:22,670
packaging they didn't have a brand they

180
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,830
didn't have containers they're used to

181
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,080
bringing whole pound units and then

182
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:31,039
having the dispensary package and so

183
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:35,079
when you're in a position to try to or

184
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,819
have to start figuring out packaging

185
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:41,060
first of all the timeframe on that is

186
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:43,639
you know six to six months to a year to

187
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,410
just try to figure out how to source and

188
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,919
how to put together compliant packaging

189
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,590
so as humble its finest we started our

190
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:56,120
rebrand for compliant packaging in

191
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:58,729
January and what we what came what we

192
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,649
came up against was that as early as

193
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,600
April the distributors we were working

194
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:04,549
with were like oh no no we're not taking

195
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,920
anymore product unless it's prepped for

196
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,020
July and we're like oh my gosh this is

197
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,530
kind of crushing because here we have

198
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:14,089
packaged product that you know should

199
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:16,759
have been able to be on the shelves

200
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:18,889
until July and then our our distributors

201
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,659
were kicking it back because they didn't

202
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,149
want to have anything in their stock

203
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,550
right come July 1st that wasn't

204
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:27,500
compliant so we'd already been doing the

205
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,569
testing and for us it was dealing with

206
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,579
the child resistant packaging component

207
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:33,950
especially when we looked at pre rolls

208
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:35,809
we do a lot of pre roll cigarette or

209
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,420
cannabis cigarettes so trying to figure

210
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:41,389
out how to especially in single serving

211
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,719
sizes manage that CRP component was

212
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:47,179
really challenging and it was expensive

213
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,490
but we're there and I think if people

214
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:51,409
didn't plan you know six nine months

215
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,649
in advance they really got caught off

216
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:56,539
guard with it and so it's it's a yeah

217
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,220
basically have a point person that you

218
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:00,610
could put on that and the resources to

219
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,899
do it to be prepared as what we found

220
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,399
you know one point to add on I think

221
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,100
that was actually really important about

222
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,289
the July transition that's very focused

223
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,209
on the lab sector was the increase in

224
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:13,399
testing requirements and the increase in

225
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:15,229
the compound lists because the phase 1

226
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,059
pesticide list really didn't encompass

227
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,230
what's normally used on cannabis and the

228
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:20,449
things that were usually the most

229
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,269
concerned about finding and so I think

230
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,459
that delaying the implementation of the

231
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:30,230
face to pesticide list especially would

232
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:32,208
have definitely been an error yeah that

233
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,149
really it's really helpful to your

234
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:53,579
perspective

235
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:53,579
