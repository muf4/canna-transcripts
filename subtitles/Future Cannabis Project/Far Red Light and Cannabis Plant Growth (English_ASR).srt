[Music]

2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:11,460
everybody's always focused on the red

3
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,169
and the blue and later research has come

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,519
along and started to show that maybe

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,730
there's other wavelengths that are of

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,368
importance McCree was one of the first

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,939
people that usually is cited as the

8
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:25,618
wavelengths that we should be selecting

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:27,300
and part of the research that he ended

10
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,879
up doing was actually defining what par

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,689
was so it was defined as between 400

12
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:35,879
nanometers to 700 nanometers but most

13
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:37,829
people want to say that between the 500

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,870
to 600 which is the green spectrum is

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,850
not quite as beneficial because the

16
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:43,140
plant reflects a lot of that light and

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,179
we're finding that as we start looking

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,710
to that the the actual efficiency of the

19
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,869
plants through the green spectrum are

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,390
actually quite high specifically as we

21
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:53,070
get to the the amber wavelengths and so

22
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,719
the potential of actually using amber

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,210
for growing plants is exceedingly high

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,370
the Makri curve shows that that's a

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,808
possibility and then research that we've

26
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:02,608
been doing at McGill University is

27
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:04,140
actually shown that it's probably one of

28
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,430
the most beneficial wavelengths for

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,320
plant growth at least from a

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,150
photosynthetic standpoint if you're

31
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,129
after secondary compounds there's other

32
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,380
factors that are driving that but as a

33
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,259
base level photosynthesis then it's the

34
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,118
amber light that drug drives that if you

35
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,650
look at the work that Bruce Bugbee has

36
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,200
been doing which is on the emerson

37
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,969
effect so this is the impact of far red

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,118
as it starts to push into the infrared

39
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:28,828
possibilities we've typically saw that

40
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,478
in the Makri curve it kind of drops off

41
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:32,489
and it basically goes to zero there's no

42
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,739
good photosynthesis that seems to happen

43
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,688
with that but the work that he's been

44
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:41,548
doing has just been recently published

45
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:43,618
shows that if if you take a far red

46
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,390
wavelength of light and blend it with

47
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:46,769
other wavelengths of light and exactly

48
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,810
what the ratio is still has to be

49
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,060
debated it seems to have a beneficial

50
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,579
effect so it's almost you need to have

51
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,129
one photon a blue light with one photon

52
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:58,589
of far red will actually give you the

53
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,839
same result as two photons a blue of a

54
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,210
red light so it seems to result in the

55
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,799
same kind of effect on this one if we

56
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,809
provide just far red

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,819
there's no photosynthetic activity or

58
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,830
almost zero photosynthetic activity that

59
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,539
happens but the the potential of

60
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,060
actually blending different wavelengths

61
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,560
of light

62
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,939
so there are some growers that like to

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,129
say well I'm gonna give far red light

64
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,609
and has this beneficial impact to my

65
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,530
plant

66
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,150
you're giving a bit of infrared so

67
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,068
you're increasing your temperature but

68
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,689
you're not driving photosynthesis with

69
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:28,899
that but if you're blending it with

70
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:31,900
background sunlight or other wavelengths

71
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,789
of light so like a white LED amber LED

72
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,289
or some other kind of LED now you're

73
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,359
getting this benefit so the Emerson

74
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:39,579
effect is an additive effect but it is

75
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,950
not a standalone effect so the lighting

76
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,860
systems that are being made now are they

77
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:47,048
not truly effective do they not do they

78
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,470
have too much red and not enough other

79
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:52,120
colors or amber so there's an ongoing

80
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:54,039
debate between whether or not we should

81
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,140
be like a full spectrum very similar to

82
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,789
sunlight is the one option the other one

83
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:00,159
is saying that well maybe we need to

84
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:02,129
have a the proper ratio of red to blue

85
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,299
or have these other wavelengths in it

86
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:05,949
what we're finding in our lab is that

87
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:07,689
the certain wavelengths that seem to be

88
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:10,359
detrimental they don't seem to provide

89
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:12,909
much benefit from photosynthesis and

90
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,560
then outside of those ones so I'm

91
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:17,199
finding that this happens kind of right

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,090
but actually varies there's a bunch of

93
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,488
different places 680 is the easy one to

94
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,019
cite but as you start bringing in these

95
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,879
other wavelengths than having different

96
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,400
ratios of them actually have benefits to

97
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,019
them but I can't at this point I don't

98
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,890
think we've moved far enough to say that

99
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:34,719
we need one percent UV five percent blue

100
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,849
and then add all these things together

101
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,859
when we've added our wavelengths

102
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,129
together into one big group we actually

103
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:43,150
get a less photosynthetic active

104
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,859
productivity out of them than if we

105
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,219
would have done just single wavelengths

106
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:51,100
by themselves so how can growers take

107
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:54,299
this information and put it to practical

108
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:59,500
use what can they do can they use it to

109
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:01,269
in their purchasing decisions in in the

110
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,579
types of lights that they use how they

111
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,489
use them how can they use it practically

112
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:08,680
yes so I get that question a fair bit

113
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,079
about how should growers actually use

114
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,450
this and my normal reaction is that

115
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,730
typically HBS is still the preferred

116
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:17,620
choice it's a good choice and no girl

117
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:19,599
will actually do poorly with that metal

118
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,250
halides also a respectable choice I find

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,539
it a little bit weaker than the high

120
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,120
pressure sodium but still a respectable

121
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:26,289
choice the broad-spectrum fluorescent

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,480
lights that you get from white

123
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,490
these are also very strong and their

124
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,050
efficiency is now surpassing a lot of

125
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,879
these other ones so purely from an

126
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,280
efficacy efficiency standpoint it's an

127
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,079
easy one if you're wanting to start to

128
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,629
push up other compounds so if you're

129
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,939
after the THC the CBDs etc out of this

130
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,889
then there is starting to be a bit of

131
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:46,660
research and it's early stages but we're

132
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:48,789
showing that specific wavelengths

133
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,850
predominantly UV can actually push up

134
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,200
some of these effects if you ask me a

135
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,970
year from now I'll give you a more

136
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,399
in-depth answer but right now it's it's

137
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,650
still early stages but clearly people

138
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:01,569
are interested in developing those other

139
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:04,089
cannabinoids in compounds of Tory that's

140
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,980
the future isn't it so yeah of course so

141
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,899
within the cannabis market being able to

142
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,879
understand how each one of the compounds

143
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:11,289
is being impacted the challenge is that

144
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,659
ultimately they're part of a biological

145
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,520
pathway and so if we're shining one

146
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,200
wavelength we're probably stimulating a

147
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,819
certain pathway but we might be losing

148
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,860
other compounds so if you want to push

149
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,990
up your THC you might be dropping off

150
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,400
your CBD so so there's a lot of

151
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,900
interrelationship that's happening

152
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,209
between those that means there needs to

153
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:30,639
be a lot of testing done correct and so

154
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:33,789
they're very much cultivar dependent

155
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,430
location dependent and so and grow or

156
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,319
how the growers are growing the plants

157
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,060
also dependent so some growers will be

158
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,560
able to say well I don't need to do this

159
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,750
because I'm doing these other tests that

160
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,160
allow me to or other environmental

161
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,410
parameters that allow me to bring these

162
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,020
things up so they kind of play with each

163
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,480
other it is does any of this change in a

164
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:54,449
mixed light situation where it's like a

165
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,250
light depth situation where you've got

166
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,829
sunlight and real lights does that

167
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,389
affect this it does so within a green

168
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:03,399
house situation we typically pull out

169
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,079
the UV light and so then we're changing

170
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,519
a lot of the cabin oeid accumulation

171
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,349
from that standpoint so adding a bit of

172
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,289
UVA would actually be beneficial or

173
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,730
using a plastic covered greenhouse it

174
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,010
doesn't have the same impact so you

175
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,810
don't need to add the UV if you're doing

176
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:19,180
it indoors then you do have to play with

177
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,329
those two different parameters so what

178
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,970
one just comment what you were saying

179
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:28,089
about like the far red stuff like in

180
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,980
conjunction with other wavelengths it's

181
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:32,949
almost like the equivalent of the

182
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,930
entourage effect right so like CBD I

183
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:36,019
slit is not as effective as a full

184
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,598
spectrum

185
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:41,149
medicine in terms of being efficacious

186
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,759
so we know that there will be certain

187
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:46,339
wavelengths that will be beneficial

188
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,288
individually but there's also some cases

189
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,579
that if I add the wrong wavelength it

190
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:52,430
will be a detriment to the whole

191
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:54,348
environment talk to the entourage if I

192
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,400
can pull that wavelength out then I will

193
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:59,689
be beneficial so right now it is almost

194
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,008
you can't just say I'm gonna add another

195
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:03,889
wavelength and it's gonna be beneficial

196
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,300
it has to be more of a understanding

197
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:07,908
some are negative and some are positive

198
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,939
does that mean that the entourage of

199
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:12,978
fact that that it's being misused or

200
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:15,709
miss that people are referring it to

201
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:18,469
sometime at times and maybe not

202
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,329
providing it well the challenge with the

203
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,550
entourage is that it's used as a

204
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:25,459
catch-all to describe everything that we

205
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,038
don't understand and so because we know

206
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:30,198
just using it like if we say just THC

207
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:31,848
unto itself has these benefits but if we

208
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,560
do it as a medical trial we don't see it

209
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:35,180
so we're trying to explain something

210
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,560
because the science hasn't got to the

211
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,269
point that we can explain what's

212
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,280
happening so I won't say it's misused

213
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:41,568
it's just we're trying to interpret

214
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,609
farther than we have a true

215
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,830
understanding of at this point have you

216
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,229
done any research on kind of different

217
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:50,750
spectrum for different stages of plant

218
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:53,149
growth or for different cultivars yeah

219
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,370
so that one's a we know that there will

220
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:57,560
be stage effects on the plant so as

221
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,870
they're young seedling or if you're

222
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,668
going to be doing grafting or tissue

223
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,590
culture there's different wavelengths

224
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:07,189
you should be pushing for that as you're

225
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:09,918
starting this part such as so I'm after

226
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:13,519
a broad spectrum white early on not any

227
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:16,339
know UV and I'd say stay away from the

228
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,839
the far red initially as it starts to

229
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:19,339
push up now you're starting to get more

230
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,598
development of roots and you're wanting

231
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:22,189
to push into these other things you can

232
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,319
start bringing in more of these other

233
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:26,569
factors which has certain stressors and

234
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,580
other parts but then as you start going

235
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:31,098
to the full flowering events now you

236
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:32,208
that that's a ultimately a stress effect

237
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:34,098
that we're wanting to do so the

238
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:36,408
accumulation of the cabins and the

239
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,329
terpenes are purely a stress defense

240
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:40,218
mechanism and so we want to start to

241
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:42,109
stress the plant in some form at that

242
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,899
point and so higher levels of UV light

243
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,528
actually is beneficial possibly changing

244
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,419
the the 10

245
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:49,818
chair of the leaf so that be the afar

246
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:51,198
red or the near-infrared type places

247
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:53,059
will actually start to push these things

248
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:55,159
and so that becomes more of a grower

249
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:57,159
decision at that point what about for

250
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,809
people who are just running nurseries or

251
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:03,219
you know genetics or just clone

252
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:05,929
operations like a dark heart is all is

253
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,999
is this information relevant to them as

254
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:10,008
well so so usually if you're just

255
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:11,540
propagating it up to the veg stage then

256
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:13,220
it's just usually a broad spectrum white

257
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:15,019
usually covers most of what you need at

258
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,850
that point there's probably special

259
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:18,649
cases where they want a certain

260
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,278
coloration or leaf structure or

261
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,568
morphology

262
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,698
then you can start to play with those

263
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:24,799
but majority of people aren't after that

264
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:29,838
what about plants that are grown for

265
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:33,109
specific purposes like to make hash I

266
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:37,249
know or different products so is are the

267
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,839
light requirements different or so this

268
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:40,730
is it actually gets into a larger

269
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,110
question on this and I'm starting to see

270
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,699
there starts to be a bit of a

271
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,669
segregation so there's field based

272
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:48,258
production which is a very I would say

273
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,719
random is the right but it's a more

274
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:52,370
natural broad spectrum everything is

275
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,990
being provided to the plant but it also

276
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,720
provides a lot of variability so it's

277
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,149
like I'm drinking wine and so a 1992

278
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,639
wine is different than a 1993 wine kind

279
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:03,740
of perspective and so if you want the

280
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,419
consistent same level of production then

281
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,339
you have to be able to control all the

282
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,808
wavelengths in the full environment if

283
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,870
you're wanting to have that variability

284
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:13,399
then that and so for some cases of the

285
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,169
people who are the connoisseurs that'll

286
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,389
be after that variability because they

287
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:19,789
want the top end but the ones who are

288
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:21,049
after a consistent medicinal product

289
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:23,000
that's always providing the same level

290
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:24,828
of pain relief or whatever they're after

291
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,839
now we have to start to control that

292
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:28,878
more finely those sound like they're

293
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,309
they're almost two completely different

294
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,199
crops and almost completely different

295
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:34,698
industry they'll have to start to treat

296
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:37,099
them as totally different production

297
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:38,808
systems greenhouses in some cases for

298
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,058
very high precision of like the

299
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:42,558
secondary compounds not your primary CBD

300
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,659
or your THC will have to be even more

301
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:46,308
finely controlled at that point and so I

302
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:48,620
can see as we start pushing down and

303
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:50,178
understand what the the sub compounds

304
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,399
are in the cabinets that we're gonna

305
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:54,169
have to be exceedingly fine in how we

306
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,089
actually control the environment to

307
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:57,990
maintain that those medicinal properties

308
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,790
well somebody who's more on the adult

309
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,200
side doesn't need quite that resolution

310
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:03,569
and then if you're gonna be doing

311
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,550
extracts for where you're already

312
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,110
balancing them afterwards then it's you

313
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:08,759
don't have to be even so still do you

314
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,800
think that there will be production

315
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,470
processes that we'll be able to produce

316
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:16,859
cannabis that is like totally consistent

317
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,540
like a pack of cigarettes or yeah yeah

318
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,610
so it's so under full controlled

319
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:21,870
environment we find consistence as long

320
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,759
as you can maintain your genetic

321
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,379
stability through the system then you'll

322
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,480
be able to hold the same consistent

323
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,309
results genetic stability my

324
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,649
understanding is that the genetics sort

325
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:33,838
of degrade over time you know when

326
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,629
they're they're not allowed to express

327
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,790
themselves fully or changed so genetics

328
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,580
there's there's always a slight mutation

329
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:44,039
that looker and so but we see that

330
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,600
within like the brewery industry also so

331
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,458
with yeast we know that they're always

332
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,350
drifting slightly so if you take like a

333
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,269
company like Coors they spend a lot of

334
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,300
money trying to maintain their base seed

335
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:55,889
stock which is their yeast and so it's

336
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:58,139
going to be the large producers that

337
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:00,088
will be doing the coolers like coolers

338
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,100
like products will have to have that

339
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:03,240
same level of trying to maintain their

340
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,649
stability there might have to be some

341
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,750
back crossing to try to get it back

342
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:09,000
they'll be doing genetic sequencing to

343
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:12,320
maintain this and so trying to hold that

344
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,320
quality all the way through
