2
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:11,660
but you have just been doing some

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,379
research and you're about to write an

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,910
op-ed on Interstate Commerce and are you

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,839
for or against it

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:25,130
well the I've been collaborating with

7
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:27,320
Adam Smith who's been a strong proponent

8
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:29,960
of interstate commerce in the cannabis

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,890
space for quite some time and he just

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,929
recently wrote a report out of the

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,060
concord current i believe that talked

12
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:41,000
about interstate commerce in the

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:44,270
cannabis space he and I are co-writing

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,369
another article talking about the

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,760
economics of this and so that should be

16
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:53,709
out in the next couple of weeks and so

17
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:56,649
but what the numbers say is that as

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,989
people don't have access to traditional

19
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:02,570
financing in order to establish cannabis

20
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:04,969
businesses you have to cash out your

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:08,870
401k or you have to get funding from

22
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:13,039
friends and family and so if they stand

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:16,040
up individual state by state industries

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,130
then it doesn't necessarily bode well

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,740
for those investors assuming full

26
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:25,339
federal legalization occurs what will

27
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:26,539
happen is that the folks in the West

28
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,390
Coast that have the competitive

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,430
advantage on cultivation side they will

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,310
overwhelm the market because they supply

31
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,110
close to over 80 percent of the supply

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,469
and naturally anyway they'll just

33
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:43,060
overrun those markets and it'll create

34
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:45,978
wealth destruction as a result and so

35
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,769
what I do on the analysis is I provide

36
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:50,799
the numbers and then I let Adam opine

37
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:53,599
about it but from a purely economic

38
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,700
perspective it makes a lot of sense to

39
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,819
allow for interstate commerce of

40
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,978
cannabis so that you don't have this

41
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:03,679
potentiality of wealth destruction

42
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:05,060
across the United States I feel like

43
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,060
those were conflicting statements right

44
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,150
you're saying in a market let's say like

45
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,560
Michigan or Ohio or Indiana if

46
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,670
California cannabis could come in it

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,189
would dominate the market

48
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:19,009
yes so that would destroy the wealth of

49
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:22,639
the people in those markets who invested

50
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:25,789
in indoor operations greenhouse

51
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,419
operations even outdoor cultivation yep

52
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:28,340
that's right

53
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:31,299
so there would be wealth destruction for

54
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:35,030
those people yeah I have a question so

55
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,920
after a federal legalization if that

56
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,680
happens and the market has settled down

57
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:43,909
is the scenario that you see that there

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:49,010
is robust cultivation in every state

59
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:53,199
supplying you know a nationwide or will

60
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:55,849
certain states be better agricultural

61
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,009
suited to produce cannabis right like

62
00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:01,609
avocados aren't growing everywhere yeah

63
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:05,120
Ian as assuming full federal

64
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:08,030
legalization occurs there will be a room

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
for small niche markets in each and

66
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,629
every state there'll be the indoor

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,480
growers the trafic growers and the like

68
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:16,909
but from a commercial perspective the

69
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:21,048
supply will come from the states that

70
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:22,370
have the greatest you know viability in

71
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,290
terms of the climate and the soil

72
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,700
composition and the rainfall and the

73
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:32,569
like so look for California and Oregon

74
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:35,810
Washington even Hawaii to be too big be

75
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,729
big players in the space on a national

76
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,860
basis in international basis and they're

77
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:43,009
already starting to position themselves

78
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:46,010
accordingly from a branding perspective

79
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:48,169
from a regional perspective like

80
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:51,560
Humboldt or you know Southern Oregon

81
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:55,000
grown son grown all those brands are

82
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,829
coming out now in order to cement that

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,870
for me you know a lot of the craft

84
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:02,810
farmers up and let's say that let's say

85
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,269
California Emerald triangle globally it

86
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,219
has brand recognition people would love

87
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,579
to smoke Humboldt weed obviously they

88
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:13,569
can't get it even in Ohio or wherever

89
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:15,829
the LA market doesn't really appreciate

90
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:20,779
Emerald triangle weed they want their

91
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:23,000
indoor so for those small farmers I feel

92
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,619
like if they could sell nationally it

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,850
would alleviate a lot of the issues that

94
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,389
are facing now and the

95
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,129
California market and then couple that

96
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:32,719
with things like you know for example

97
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:35,120
used to be able to do farmers markets in

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,830
California where Emerald triangle

99
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,209
farmers could bring their amazing

100
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:42,740
harvest and December down to SoCal and

101
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:44,180
smoke everybody out and sell it and

102
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,129
people would love and appreciate it and

103
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,949
that could they could sell a good

104
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:51,769
portion of their small harvest and be

105
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,329
set for the next season so can you talk

106
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:56,299
about the data you had mentioned earlier

107
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:57,709
about how much cannabis is produced I

108
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,750
think we had talked about just humbled

109
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:05,779
or the Emerald triangle in general yeah

110
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:09,860
so I recently put together a calculation

111
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:13,189
of the entire output of cannabis in the

112
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,370
United States both illicit ly and

113
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:22,089
legally and bifurcated that between

114
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:25,250
indoor outdoor and greenhouse roughly

115
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:27,439
fourteen million pounds of cannabis are

116
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,829
cultivated and produced in California

117
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,709
alone and that's by far the largest

118
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:35,359
amount and of that fourteen million

119
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,879
pounds twelve million of that is

120
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,740
actually exported to other markets so

121
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,990
they say 2 million is going into the

122
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,530
regulated California market track and

123
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:50,569
trace yeah 2 million pounds will satisfy

124
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:51,709
the legal demand in California at the

125
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:54,670
present time

126
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:57,560
not all of it necessarily is making it

127
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:00,350
into the market right now you know

128
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,819
because of the limitations that have

129
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,280
been created by the California

130
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:08,089
regulators and you know all those

131
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,309
obstacles but you know roughly 2 million

132
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:12,379
pounds still pretty significant it's

133
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,649
larger than most of other markets around

134
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:18,199
the United States but like I said that

135
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:20,329
12 million pound figure that's being

136
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,420
exported to every state in the country

137
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:26,449
and elsewhere that's a significant

138
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,350
amount that will and those growers will

139
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:32,360
benefit from the either full federal

140
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:35,090
legalization or for the allowance for

141
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,330
exports out of California so this

142
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:40,909
interstate play to allow interstate

143
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:43,579
sales what would it look like would it

144
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,830
be and first of all do you need federal

145
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:47,629
approval obviously you do to do it right

146
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:50,089
because you're crossing state lines or

147
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:51,439
how would that work yeah I I guess to

148
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:54,079
follow up in that question like you

149
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,969
can't have California and Nevada

150
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,620
agreeing that they'll do interstate

151
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,970
commerce between them and the federal

152
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,149
government would be ok with that

153
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:07,160
right well it's still kind of in a gray

154
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:09,829
area right now essentially because of

155
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,640
the legacy of the Kohl memorandum

156
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:15,620
there's an opportunity that says that

157
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,180
you can't have funding if you're doing

158
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,090
things legally in one state versus the

159
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:23,240
other and so so it's still a gray area

160
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:26,329
at the federal level but what it takes

161
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,009
at the state level is one to say hey I

162
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:30,879
want to export to you and then the

163
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:33,740
governor and the other state saying

164
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,529
assuming it's legal there as well that

165
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,939
they'll be willing to receive it but but

166
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:40,250
but but actually on that what if you

167
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:43,610
have to go over other state like it's

168
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:46,009
easy when it's state next adjacent but

169
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,379
what if it's what if California strikes

170
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:51,740
a deal with New York State and you have

171
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:53,899
to transport that by air well I wanted

172
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,990
to follow up on that too because that

173
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:59,870
would make sense now if you had Oregon

174
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:04,009
in California those are two cannabis

175
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,780
mature markets but in your in your world

176
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,509
in the economic world do we want to

177
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:10,668
develop those relationships between a

178
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:13,789
California and in New York or a

179
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:16,129
Californian of Florida less less

180
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,689
developed to Canada's market yes you

181
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:21,620
definitely want to establish those

182
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:23,629
relationships now and to develop those

183
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,850
markets and those relationships in order

184
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:28,699
to say your supplier in California

185
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:31,310
Oregon or what elsewhere to establish

186
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:35,389
your distribution channels in New York

187
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:37,460
now Governor Cuomo has already kind of

188
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:41,088
laid the foundation for this he's going

189
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,589
to his adjacent markets and Pennsylvania

190
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,990
and Massachusetts and elsewhere and

191
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:49,670
saying hey we need to harmonize our

192
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:51,329
rules and regulations in order to allow

193
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:55,498
for something of this

194
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:58,258
or at least not to have a you know one

195
00:08:55,499 --> 00:09:00,540
state having more favorable policies

196
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,269
than another state but they do they also

197
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:06,360
want to up their their regional leverage

198
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:10,980
like like a NAFTA of the northeasters

199
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:14,999
exactly well I'm not sure about the

200
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,949
intention but European Union but what is

201
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:19,649
interesting though is I've talked to a

202
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:22,318
lot of state regulators executive

203
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:25,708
directors and that level directors of

204
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:28,948
these regulated programs and they really

205
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:33,088
want to have these harmonization of

206
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:36,149
rules so that the packaging requirements

207
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,980
in one state is identical to the

208
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:41,610
packaging requirements in another state

209
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,789
and they're trying to harmonize this via

210
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,589
the state-by-state meetings where we

211
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:49,860
were where we were was kind of the

212
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:51,629
harmonization of like the different

213
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,730
markets and you mentioned like packaging

214
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:55,918
like examples of things that they would

215
00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:00,539
kind of coordinate on yeah labeling

216
00:09:55,918 --> 00:10:03,600
dosage packaging license requirements

217
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:07,078
and like because the intention of these

218
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,360
regulators is to lay the foundation for

219
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:12,388
full federal legalization at the state

220
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,668
level so that when it does go federally

221
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:17,489
legal the feds don't come in and try to

222
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:19,438
mandate rules and regulations in a

223
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:22,290
market that they don't understand so a

224
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:24,568
lot of these regulators at the state

225
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:27,599
level like this oh my god there's one

226
00:10:24,568 --> 00:10:29,159
right there there's Massachusetts come

227
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,119
on wait wait actually can we ask you one

228
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:35,059
quick question no no we come sit come

229
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:39,259
sit

230
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:41,349
no she can't okay j-just quickly are you

231
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:43,850
trying to harmonize

232
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:47,389
Massachusetts state regulations with

233
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,490
your neighboring states as we go gene

234
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:51,500
requirements and things like that yes as

235
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,090
we go forward all of the states are

236
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,309
talking to each other obviously the

237
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,560
states near us are just coming online

238
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:59,719
like New York and Connecticut Rhode

239
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:02,779
Island has an existing market and New

240
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,029
Hampshire and Vermont are more consumer

241
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:07,129
focused rather than a commercial focus

242
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,329
but yes we've worked well with Maine and

243
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,559
we look forward to working with the

244
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:14,180
other New England states as they go

245
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:15,739
forward all right thank you I actually

246
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:18,109
have a fall what does she mean by

247
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:22,029
commercial focused as a place she's I

248
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:25,450
think she meant meant medical right no

249
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:28,069
commercial like in the production and

250
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,930
manufacturing and cultivation versus

251
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,840
because some of these some of these

252
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:35,329
markets are only just retail right so

253
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,600
where do they so source for are you

254
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:41,240
serious so they're legal retail but

255
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,570
they're they're like going like this

256
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,460
like where it may not have in state some

257
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,110
are vertically integrated right so you

258
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,200
have to be vertically integrated versus

259
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:55,430
like and that's an interesting topic in

260
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,580
itself because in Florida they they

261
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:00,409
ruled that vertical integration is

262
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:03,590
unconstitutional in Florida and so they

263
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:06,409
blew up that whole system but what these

264
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:09,320
as was validated and do you agree with

265
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:11,629
that like do you do like that Florida is

266
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,350
not letting people vertically integrate

267
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:18,289
it I do because it it gives more

268
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:22,190
opportunities more jobs more wages more

269
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:24,610
economic opportunities for city and

270
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,050
state and local municipalities to

271
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,129
benefit from the cannabis industry and

272
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:32,539
so yeah I'm I've been a big fan of

273
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:35,870
spreading the wealth as much as possible

274
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:39,559
so which market gives some grades to

275
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:43,730
states that are making it possible for

276
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:46,879
mom and pops to thrive like who gets an

277
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,670
A and who get like who gets a C and who

278
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,029
gets an F

279
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:53,909
that you know that states you know given

280
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:56,429
the fact that I have these great

281
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:58,379
relations with all of these regulators I

282
00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:02,939
think it would be a little bit difficult

283
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:08,009
to grade but you know but who can

284
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:09,900
improve Oh like the Wild West right like

285
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:12,750
they're just like let's let everybody

286
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:16,139
play how's that going what Oklahoma has

287
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:19,259
done is that they've allowed for greater

288
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:21,470
access and so you really just need a

289
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:24,899
note from your doctor in order to get

290
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:28,550
you know access to cannabis and really

291
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:30,569
not a whole lot or a limited number of

292
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:33,870
qualifying conditions so they've

293
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,990
Oklahoma has opened it wide wide open so

294
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,659
it's medical but they're very lenient on

295
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,700
what like my knee hurts I need okay

296
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:44,399
exactly but but I guess where I was

297
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,980
coming from was the the entrepreneurial

298
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,740
side where Oklahoma like if Tom and I

299
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,620
wanted to start a tincture company we

300
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:56,639
could started in Oklahoma and like get

301
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:58,529
go see this is like I said earlier I'm a

302
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,860
firm believer in spreading the wealth

303
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:04,259
out to as many people as possible but

304
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,300
because each state is a closed market

305
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:08,069
there's going to be limited there's

306
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,559
going to be a limit to the amount of

307
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,500
economic opportunity that each state has

308
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:16,559
and a perfect example of this is Oregon

309
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,840
where they issued licenses out to a

310
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,569
large number of cultivators a large

311
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,850
number of retailers and like hoping to

312
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,280
draw in folks from the illicit market

313
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,310
and do things legally but what they

314
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:32,519
didn't do effectively enough is balance

315
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:34,769
the supply and demand elements and as a

316
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,019
result of all of those licenses they

317
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:39,990
sure they spread out the economic

318
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,090
opportunity but what happened is it

319
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,909
created this tremendous tsunami of

320
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:47,250
supply and it really took the prices

321
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:48,990
down substantially and ended up hurting

322
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,450
those small businesses that they were

323
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:55,680
actually trying to support so in

324
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:58,830
California we California does allow

325
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,349
vertical integration licenses but not

326
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,590
everyone gets them

327
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:06,409
the retail sector some people have the

328
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:08,950
micro licenses and then others don't do

329
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:12,889
you see that as an uneven playing field

330
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:15,830
or have you taken a look at that yeah

331
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:20,809
you know oregan allows for vertical

332
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:22,310
integration as well and you know so you

333
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:26,599
know if you can get your license then

334
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:28,849
great but it's just the fact is that you

335
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,610
don't have to write in some states like

336
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:34,250
Florida you had to up until just

337
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:37,220
recently and so that's what's different

338
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:40,190
and so the value of those licenses in

339
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,019
Florida were worth tens of millions of

340
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,300
dollars I think I did a valuation of one

341
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:46,909
of them I think it was like 50 million

342
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:48,979
dollars for that license because it was

343
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:51,309
vertically integrated and you had to

344
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,190
source all of your supply from yourself

345
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:58,309
whereas the value of a license in Oregon

346
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:00,650
was maybe one fiftieth of that amount

347
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:02,539
just because there were more licenses to

348
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,090
be had can you actually talk about how

349
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:08,689
you approach putting evaluation on

350
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:11,300
licenses yeah sure a lot of people are

351
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,520
like we're gonna be an MSO and we're

352
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:15,769
gonna roll up a whole bunch of operators

353
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,059
and you know then it's like okay what

354
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:18,350
are you gonna pay for those operators

355
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,599
and on the other side people are like

356
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,310
we're gonna raise money and we're gonna

357
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,529
start selling stuff and we're gonna have

358
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:27,349
a hundred thousand dollars in sales and

359
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:30,439
exit for a ten million dollar valuation

360
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,180
the consistency of the value of those

361
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,590
licenses which we're seeing can

362
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:36,169
fluctuate and change according to

363
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,300
regulations or other factors so how are

364
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:41,029
you putting a valuation on a company

365
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:43,909
there's a number of ways that you can go

366
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:47,480
about it and what I try to do is I try

367
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:49,549
to use multiple techniques and then look

368
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,860
at the differences in the values that

369
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:55,549
come as a result of it but generally

370
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,889
what you do is you look at the past

371
00:16:55,549 --> 00:17:00,709
history and the future forecast of a

372
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:03,319
company you look at how much revenue

373
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,710
they've produced how much their cost

374
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,340
structure is what their margins are and

375
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:12,759
then you assign a multiplier

376
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,609
to that value right so some in nascent

377
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:17,529
markets there's not a whole lot of

378
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:19,750
comparables or comparables and so

379
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:21,819
there's you can't have there's not a

380
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:25,599
great deal of consistency from one

381
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:27,849
evaluation to another to another but

382
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,339
generally in the nascent markets you

383
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,319
look at the top line revenue and assign

384
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:34,299
a multiplier to it time with that

385
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:38,799
multiplier be higher than in a saturated

386
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:40,809
market like Oregon like the multiple

387
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,700
that accompanies trip like the multiple

388
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:45,940
of earnings that ik that a company is

389
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:50,710
trading at well a lot of the valuation

390
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:52,690
or would be sold at yeah it you do have

391
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,730
to factor in the environment and the

392
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,519
regulatory and all that right so there's

393
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,960
a there's a risk factor or a beta that

394
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,809
you assigned to it as well

395
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,430
right so you do your valuation you say

396
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:07,149
for example if you go this approach

397
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:09,310
top-line revenue assign a multiplier and

398
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,790
they're different between cultivators

399
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:15,849
and processors and retailers processors

400
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:18,700
generally have higher multiples than do

401
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:20,469
retailers and like and there's there's

402
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:25,200
reasons for that and what are some of

403
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:28,630
the reasons well retailers for example

404
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,230
they have a different cost structure

405
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:35,410
different taxation there there's much

406
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,630
greater costs associated with taxation

407
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:40,720
because there's not as many write offs

408
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:43,240
that's 280 right but but but could you

409
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,549
factor in that potential like if that if

410
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,470
280 changed down the road it would the

411
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:49,809
multiplier would increase right the

412
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:54,519
valuations would definitely increase

413
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:57,429
because another strategy is looking at

414
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,930
your profitability and by looking at the

415
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,769
profitability then you assign a

416
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:06,700
multiplier now with a change in 280e tax

417
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:07,990
law that would immediately impact your

418
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,210
bottom line because you wouldn't be

419
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,339
paying as much taxes and as a result

420
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,470
you'd be potential for greater

421
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:17,319
profitability which would make you more

422
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:19,269
valuable in the marketplace so if the

423
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,579
feds don't seem interested in giving up

424
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:22,150
that

425
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:25,879
money at all well that's interesting

426
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:28,509
they're getting there three years ago

427
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,220
when President Trump came into office

428
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:35,509
the group that I work for a new frontier

429
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:37,220
data presented my two ad analysis to a

430
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:40,400
health policy advisor for President

431
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,289
Trump his reaction was why would I give

432
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,960
up six billion dollars in tax revenue

433
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:47,480
right but if you think about it it's a

434
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,730
valid question but what you give up

435
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,529
quote-unquote you pay for more than via

436
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,779
employment via social security's and

437
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:58,910
payroll taxes business taxes and like

438
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:01,369
when you're supposedly a business

439
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,500
friendly republican administration right

440
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:07,279
what you're saying that argument is is

441
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,559
gaining traction the argument they'll

442
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,059
make up more along but you said they're

443
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,789
coming around yeah they're coming around

444
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:17,000
and so now the conversations at the

445
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:19,279
federal level on tax reform and banking

446
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,130
those conversations are heating up right

447
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:25,700
now and so that I mentioned in my speech

448
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:28,310
earlier that there is a briefing that

449
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,009
we're we're helping these folks prep for

450
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:33,500
on the Senate Banking Committee and

451
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:35,539
Senate Finance Committee that is one of

452
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,910
the data points that we gave them was

453
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:40,000
the impact of 280e

454
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:45,850
the impact of doing cash-only business

455
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,880
and the risks associated with that just

456
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:54,109
just can't can you name some policy

457
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,520
sensible politicians in Washington like

458
00:20:54,109 --> 00:21:01,699
some of the people who are like this

459
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:07,639
just makes sense not from Oregon what

460
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:12,049
we're seeing is that as the mainstream

461
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:14,840
population gets more and more accepting

462
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:20,470
of cannabis use in their day-to-day

463
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:23,539
lives as states roll out reform and

464
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:26,059
legalization either at a medical side or

465
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:29,149
at the adult use side those states that

466
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,569
are represented by those legal states

467
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:35,250
that are represented

468
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:38,189
a tend to have more favorable views and

469
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:43,079
influence in Washington DC right and

470
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:45,870
because now 98% of the citizens of the

471
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:48,509
United States have some form of access

472
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:52,500
to cannabis either through CBD medical

473
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:56,519
or adult use and given the Pew Research

474
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:59,519
and other surveys that show there's

475
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,628
sixty four sixty five percent in favor

476
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:07,349
of legalization these types of

477
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:09,658
statistics are helping politicians get

478
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:12,808
the traction that they that they desire

479
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,879
on reform policies but but are there

480
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:17,339
specific people and either the Senate or

481
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:19,859
the house that are like Dana Rohrabacher

482
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:22,408
was a friend to cannabis right like he

483
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:24,298
was out there championing like who's the

484
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:26,149
next wave of people that we should all

485
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:30,950
was a big fan of Russian cannabis

486
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:30,949
Russians and Kant Russians and cannabis

487
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:41,609
Putin yeah it's it's really tough to

488
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:45,599
call out names per se that are more

489
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:49,678
favorable than others but what I will

490
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:53,490
say is that you know now that you've got

491
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:56,639
California online for the most part and

492
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:59,609
all of those votes in the House of

493
00:22:56,638 --> 00:23:00,119
Representative representatives now that

494
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:02,939
year

495
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:06,689
you've got New York and the East Coast

496
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:10,889
starting to consider cannabis reform

497
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:14,909
then those folks that traditionally had

498
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:17,189
so Nancy Pelosi is now supportive and

499
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:21,778
Chuck Schumer I'm thinking of people in

500
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:24,330
those states she's out here Nancy Pelosi

501
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:29,069
she's wacky she's in Washington but she

502
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:31,069
represents right yes so there's like I

503
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:34,048
said there's a greater propensity

504
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:36,089
nowadays to support cannabis reform it's

505
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:37,679
even coming up on in the presidential

506
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:40,138
campaign I mean because it gets you

507
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,169
votes how many times have you heard

508
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:46,829
either that somebody consumed

509
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:49,440
previously or that they're in favor or

510
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:51,750
in the first day of their presidency

511
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,659
they're gonna you know do a presidential

512
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,849
mandate you know D scheduling I mean

513
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,980
this is coming up in practically every

514
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:01,339
debate that we're seeing now whereas

515
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,659
even four years ago or eight years ago

516
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:06,778
it wouldn't even come up it wasn't even

517
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:09,028
an issue so a lot of the politicians

518
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:13,710
that I've talked to are saying that this

519
00:24:09,028 --> 00:24:16,440
is actually a bipartisan issue yeah but

520
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,990
it can be used to differentiate one

521
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,980
candidate over another in these

522
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:24,569
elections especially in the primaries so

523
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,558
just quickly getting back to the initial

524
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:29,819
conversation about Interstate Commerce

525
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:32,398
so when I think of like the Kraft

526
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:35,099
farmers who you know their stuff is

527
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:38,459
appreciated by people in other markets

528
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:42,089
it's obviously also the large scale

529
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,370
growers in Salinas and Santa Barbara who

530
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:49,168
also see a benefit of being able to

531
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:51,839
export globally yeah the you know the

532
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:54,270
benefits are those that have that core

533
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,668
competency in a specific task right

534
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:58,259
either cultivation or processing for

535
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:00,600
that matter if they have that core

536
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:02,579
competency then of course they're they

537
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,798
have a leg up relative to other people

538
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:08,849
that are just trying to start out you

539
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:11,819
know in the market so yeah by allowing

540
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:14,969
interstate commerce of cannabis it would

541
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:17,579
be very beneficial to those that are

542
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:19,589
producing large quantities especially on

543
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:23,278
the west coast it will really help with

544
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:24,898
standardization as well in a big way

545
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:26,519
right now if companies want to go into

546
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:31,048
other states do you have to create their

547
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:34,440
own footprint or have partners and and

548
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:37,048
and those are all extremely difficult

549
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,940
tasks that all these companies have been

550
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:41,299
doing for the last three to four years

551
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:46,100
in order to expand their brand

552
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:48,680
yeah for sure and you know it's with the

553
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:52,569
with regards to MSOs multi-state

554
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:55,940
operators by establishing that brand now

555
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:57,740
and being allowed to export it of course

556
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,690
it's gonna you know it's going to

557
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,640
benefit those guys here's my question

558
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,430
and maybe we can kind of wrap it up

559
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,880
because it rolls in to a de and the

560
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:10,820
states and inner Syria tightest well I'm

561
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,280
gonna try to and coming back to opening

562
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:15,319
up the market when you look at the

563
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,869
nascent markets or states that are about

564
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,339
to come online you're like sometimes

565
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:21,459
when I look at them it seems like you

566
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:23,599
have to be a conglomerate or a

567
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:26,809
multi-millionaire in order to enter

568
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:30,169
those markets and so is that an

569
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:32,509
impediment to the establishment of

570
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:35,150
creation of the type of Industry that we

571
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:37,789
want to see that that has players at all

572
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:40,130
different levels and where the cost to

573
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:42,289
entry is is is not absolutely

574
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,870
prohibitive well yeah because they have

575
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:48,379
a vested interest and keeping it do we

576
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:52,279
see do you see that do you see that that

577
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:56,050
the value or the appreciation for a more

578
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:59,569
diverse economy in the nation states

579
00:26:56,049 --> 00:27:03,169
yeah it each one of these states though

580
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:05,990
it the success or failure and how

581
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:08,390
widespread the economic benefit is is

582
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:11,750
really determined by the regulatory

583
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,610
structure and it's really unfortunate

584
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,460
in some states you know you have to lay

585
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:18,079
down two million dollars in order to you

586
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,970
know be considered you have to have a

587
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:23,149
certain amount of that two million

588
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,529
dollars liquid and so that's a huge you

589
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,780
have an example of one of those days

590
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:30,279
that was I think that might have been

591
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:33,170
Michigan or Ohio right and so you've got

592
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:36,759
you've got those huge barriers to entry

593
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:41,210
at a at the very time where a lot of

594
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:44,240
these communities minorities people of

595
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:47,990
color have been impacted negatively by

596
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,910
the war on drugs those are just creating

597
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,039
these barriers to entry and not allowing

598
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,960
for access to those folks that could

599
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:56,009
really benefit from it you know and so

600
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:00,360
that's the unfortunate

601
00:27:56,009 --> 00:28:04,920
and so but as interstate commerce occurs

602
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:08,399
the intent of that type of policy and

603
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:12,840
legislation would be to actually reduce

604
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:15,180
the harm that would otherwise occur to

605
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:18,629
these small businesses these minority

606
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:21,330
businesses and alike that would occur if

607
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,070
they just get wiped out due to full

608
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:25,079
federal legalization right so it's more

609
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:27,000
of a preventative measure which will

610
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:30,689
actually benefit the communities right

611
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,420
you'll allow for four people with core

612
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,519
competencies and growing to export to

613
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,980
states where there's a core competency

614
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,930
and distribution and retail and so

615
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,750
that's the model and the model makes

616
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:46,920
really really good sense do you guys

617
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:49,500
have a like a an idea about how this

618
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:54,779
might come to pass like a timeline or a

619
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,849
hopeful like road to interstate crystal

620
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:59,819
or a crystal ball like what's the plan

621
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:03,209
what's the strategy for federal

622
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:05,909
interstate or interstate commerce like

623
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,700
one year just lobbying lobbying and

624
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:11,670
lobbying I think that there's two

625
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,920
absolutes in cannabis one is I don't

626
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,890
know how many 19 year olds I've met with

627
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,320
twenty years growing experience

628
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:21,570
everybody has 20 years and then the

629
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,710
other absolute is everything is gonna

630
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:24,899
take five years

631
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:26,880
I mean I've heard for five years that

632
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:30,570
it's gonna be fully federally legal

633
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,490
right and so I think my default answer

634
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:38,609
to your question would be in about five

635
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:43,620
years but but in in reality I mean it's

636
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:45,740
it's it could be accelerated if a couple

637
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:50,069
of these large states like Pennsylvania

638
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:53,609
like New York like New Jersey if they

639
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:55,139
deploy legal programs and they drive

640
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:56,909
this policy because they'll be greater

641
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,259
representation in the Senate greater

642
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,980
representation in the House of

643
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:01,829
Representatives

644
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,819
so that could create a cascade effect

645
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:08,309
which accelerates the pace of reform so

646
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:11,490
is it going to happen in two years

647
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:14,940
probably not three maybe five for sure

648
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:17,190
I'm speaking on camera here as Bo

649
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,019
Whitney of Whitney economics and not as

650
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,240
a representative representatives of new

651
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:23,879
frontier data but new frontier data

652
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,390
doesn't do any advocating at all they

653
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,730
don't take a legal position on you know

654
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:32,910
the legality of cannabis they don't we

655
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,569
don't propose legislation or anything

656
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,040
like that

657
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:40,189
what we do is we analyze the market now

658
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:46,009
under Whitney economics I have a greater

659
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:49,650
flexibility to take on projects like the

660
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:53,579
interstate commerce bills and in writing

661
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:58,320
on that because it could take on a more

662
00:30:53,579 --> 00:31:01,349
advocacy like tone and so that's why you

663
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:04,710
know I've been you know doing a lot of

664
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:07,049
work under Whitney economics yeah it's a

665
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:09,390
consulting business out of out of

666
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:11,639
Portland Oregon it's a company where

667
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:14,370
I've done the business valuations the

668
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:18,900
expert witness testimony I'm currently

669
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:21,149
doing a analysis of retail op retail

670
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,880
chain in Washington and I'm going in and

671
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:27,360
optimizing their operations to drive

672
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,000
greater revenue and decrease their cost

673
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,709
structure so I do all that under Whitney

674
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,720
economic you talk can you talk about

675
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,519
some things how you've whipped them into

676
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,190
business shape like some specific

677
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,519
concrete recommendations you've made to

678
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,410
them

679
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,289
I've made some recommendation they're a

680
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:47,580
little bit proprietary but what I have

681
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:51,750
the capability to do is I can dial up an

682
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:55,409
address say this location right here and

683
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:59,279
I can tell you how many people stood in

684
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:00,990
this location and for how long and if

685
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,670
they've come back over the course of

686
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,099
three months I can tell you what your

687
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:07,440
foot traffic is what your pattern and

688
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:10,230
how long people have stayed and then

689
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,690
also I can tell if they went to another

690
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:16,049
dispensary two miles down the road and

691
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:18,140
how long they stayed there and so so I

692
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:19,609
should turn off my geolocation

693
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,860
you know my cell phone is what you're

694
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:23,599
saying well there's other ways to get to

695
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:27,109
that data but that's one of them will

696
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:29,889
still track you and so yeah but and then

697
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:32,979
in addition to that you can see whether

698
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:35,630
geographically they're in a good flow

699
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,940
location like foot traffic if they have

700
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,340
if they have recursion right so if

701
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,650
people come back when you recurring

702
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:45,230
customers or if they're just you know

703
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,150
one and done and then I can look at

704
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:51,980
these other locations and see if they're

705
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:53,600
one and done and then or if retailer

706
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,759
number one it's losing business to

707
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:59,119
retailer number two so I can do all that

708
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:00,349
analysis but then I can also talk this

709
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,389
also looking at point-of-sale

710
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:04,579
information to or it's my question about

711
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:07,610
that where their data derives from is if

712
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:10,179
you can do it in some markets it's

713
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:14,059
different because point-of-sale data

714
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:16,519
like in Oregon has to be redacted by law

715
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:22,099
and so you can't like anonymized

716
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:25,730
anonymized but but in other states you

717
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:30,079
have a lot more access to data do you

718
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:33,410
have access to metric data only if it's

719
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:36,589
provided to me by the retailer and so

720
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:39,130
some of the upper level metric stuff I

721
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:42,319
would I'd love to get my hands on

722
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:45,440
because I could tell you through pretty

723
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,879
simple quantitative analysis who are the

724
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,070
good actors and who are the bad actors

725
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,700
you know this is actually a great

726
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:55,669
question to ask you is data in the

727
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,640
cannabis industry and you the silo

728
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:01,640
effect of data and what is what is your

729
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,040
impression of that subject it's it's

730
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,900
before we get to that can you tell us

731
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:08,418
how you could tell who the bad actors

732
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,960
aren't the good actors well you know

733
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:13,908
I've I've basically run a vertically

734
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,668
integrated company before I was the CEO

735
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:18,470
of a company and took in public and did

736
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:21,559
all that right so I know the

737
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:23,719
nitty-gritty details of cultivation of

738
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,969
processing retail distribution right and

739
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:28,519
so that's what I leverage in a lot of my

740
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:30,439
consulting work is because I I know the

741
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:31,918
operations are practically better than

742
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,099
they know it themselves right

743
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,558
and so on some of the bad actors right

744
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:41,068
you can look at their production output

745
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,750
you can do a time-series look at what

746
00:34:41,068 --> 00:34:45,358
they're doing two years ago three years

747
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:47,398
ago versus what they're doing now you

748
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,068
can see their yields you could see I

749
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:53,548
mean there's a lot of ways in which you

750
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:55,980
can ascertain you know who's consistent

751
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:59,548
and a good actor versus who is somebody

752
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:06,659
that's you know potentially taking stuff

753
00:34:59,548 --> 00:35:08,400
out the back door there are these hybrid

754
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:09,568
models and that's the unfortunate thing

755
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,048
about what's going on in California

756
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:16,230
right now is that the way that the

757
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:19,588
regulatory structure is set up the

758
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:21,869
barriers to entry all of this stuff it's

759
00:35:19,588 --> 00:35:24,420
really forcing people into that hybrid

760
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:26,220
model of represent everybody is selling

761
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,559
out the back door just to be able to put

762
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:31,980
food on the table and live to for

763
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:35,040
another day all right well hey thanks a

764
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:37,139
lot great questions I appreciate it I

765
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:41,670
could have kept going but let me know

766
