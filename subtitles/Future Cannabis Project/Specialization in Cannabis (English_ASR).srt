1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
and I don't think I know the whole

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:06,028
industry I'm not a master of distally

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,099
that's not where I spent my time when I

4
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:10,109
saw when I went when dis little first

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,490
came out we started seeing extraction

6
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:14,910
and when the first cats will born out of

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,969
PVC tubes cooking it on the oven so this

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,079
would have been 201 you know this is

9
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,479
when his first people started first

10
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:25,349
squirting so I hit up my mom and say hey

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,730
mom from a scientific point of view what

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,410
does this look like in the modern world

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,000
so she sends me all the modern

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,399
extraction pictures of today and I said

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,200
oh I'm frightened enough cases already

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,450
if I could call that shit I'm doing fed

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,370
time there's no way I so I'm gonna leave

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,140
it alone I work with production I'll

19
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:41,849
feed people but I didn't want to get

20
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,230
into doing distillate production because

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,520
I knew that if I go grab with this shit

22
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:48,959
there's yeah and I realized that it was

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,520
going to cause me problems I wouldn't be

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,230
able to get out of because it was going

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,180
to be a huge attraction for massive

26
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:55,500
penalties and if I catch a Fed case I'm

27
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,320
doing automatic thing I'm doing

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,119
automatic them do a five-year bid off a

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,738
settlement I'm gonna have to do five I

30
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,750
might even do greater but I'm gonna have

31
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:07,019
to take the deal or I'm gonna be looking

32
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,719
at 20 and it's not the joint time that

33
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,640
kills me it's the time that kills me I

34
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,679
can handle joint time I can't handle the

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,670
years of not being present in my life

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,220
and I got kids and I got a life and so I

37
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,750
said I'm cool with the distillate so I

38
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,579
messed around with people that are

39
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,379
confident and I go to labs all the time

40
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,450
and I hang out and I got pot as I do

41
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,890
this stuff but that's not what I do so

42
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,109
when I look at pen cartridges I go neat

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,609
they asked me we need varieties to feed

44
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:34,469
into it what are you looking for and I

45
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,328
can go my direction but I don't want to

46
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,340
be brilliant every goddamn room because

47
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,289
you're not you end up defusing your

48
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,270
overall knowledge base so I try to stay

49
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,250
within cultivation I try to stay with

50
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,048
the propagation I try to stay with

51
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,790
organic cultivation so I understand how

52
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,850
to run biologically driven systems

53
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,439
outside and I work on market because all

54
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:54,569
those things would prior what I've done

55
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,699
and it's just an expansion of what I'm

56
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,258
doing now I'm not trying to be a

57
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,060
distributor I don't want to be one I

58
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,459
have distribution company tied to me

59
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,899
the term stripping I don't wanna be the

60
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,599
term stripper I have companies coming in

61
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,939
utilizing my facility the manufacturing

62
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,579
and processing we own the properties and

63
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,750
the facility so it lets us utilize our

64
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,890
resources but when

65
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,990
gonna be the ones that come in and do

66
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,669
that we'll be able to have partners come

67
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,700
in and do it so this way it lets me and

68
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:23,489
my guys stay where we belong and just

69
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,659
stay on point and keep chasing what

70
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,020
we're chasing which is just nasty

71
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,060
varietals stuff this nasty and stuff

72
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,260
that works for the cultivator and stuff

73
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,120
that the market I call it market

74
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,319
velocity but things that leave in the

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,900
money comes back leave money comes back

76
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,430
leave money comes back and you create a

77
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,689
real loop and it's not something that's

78
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,520
going to pop up well I use purple

79
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,259
punches in example yeah this shit looks

80
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,780
incredible in a bag smokers shit twice I

81
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:49,229
challenge you smoke it twice because

82
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,610
really it's horrible yeah no and it's in

83
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:52,139
it I mean I see some people bring me

84
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,550
bags at his stuff at the shop like bro

85
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:57,000
and then it is some of the most

86
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,920
picturesque cannabis ever floured you

87
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,560
couldn't get a better shine off that

88
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,229
shit and I'm just like whoever it is

89
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,080
stellar but as soon as you smoke it you

90
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:09,238
go where's old terpenes and was on the

91
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,070
conch and it's gone and it's and it's

92
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,530
it's it's an OG to a purpose so the

93
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,969
potentials there but but the quality

94
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,890
wasn't selected it was selected off

95
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:18,719
Instagram ability and even though

96
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,759
Instagram drives so much of what you're

97
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,049
doing it's not gonna drive a lot of your

98
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,370
new users because that's not where

99
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,709
they're gonna shop for their weed I

100
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,390
don't buy steak from Instagram I'm not

101
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,030
buying my soda from instant I don't

102
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:32,518
drink soda but using that as an example

103
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,419
I'm not buying enough IG I don't buy to

104
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,709
Facebook either I buy it off of either

105
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:38,819
marketing that's been locally done or

106
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,039
marketing that's into conventional

107
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,870
methodologies and so it's triangle yep

108
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,759
and it's trying to figure out how do you

109
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,799
create that and how do you create

110
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,389
systems that are accurate so that

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,590
there's a bunch of us that work with

112
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,689
these systems so we don't have

113
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,219
redundancy so you and I aren't competing

114
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,490
on the same

115
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:58,159
level you have your product diversity I

116
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:00,140
have my product diversity they both fit

117
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,270
the gradient they're both scientifically

118
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:05,059
accurate they both work for us as

119
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:07,370
cultivators it allows us to work in true

120
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,250
capacity once I started research in

121
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,870
Champaign model in France I saw it

122
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,500
because Champaign model is defined by

123
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,289
the house

124
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,649
so Champaign model is for specific

125
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:20,180
grapes one production methodology if you

126
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:22,399
want to be part of the Champaign gang

127
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,550
you're getting certified on one

128
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,709
production methodology for grapes that's

129
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,960
it and what that does that creates a

130
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:32,449
standardized product that the house can

131
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,219
mine from so most houses not even run in

132
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:36,589
their own fields they don't need to they

133
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,110
can buy from every little farmer gather

134
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:41,359
the grape and then it's how they process

135
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,129
the grape it's how they go through the

136
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,379
carbonation process is how they go

137
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:48,079
through all the holding process that's

138
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:49,459
what defines Champaign what everybody in

139
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,829
cannabis thinks it's going to be the

140
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:53,479
Burgundy model where it's going to be

141
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:55,819
Appalachians where it's my little piece

142
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,490
of property is so unique that it imparts

143
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:01,189
such a quality of experience to the

144
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,139
flower that it will define me but the

145
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:06,079
problem is a lot of that methodology and

146
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:09,110
models work because France was able to

147
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,810
do this in 1860s no one had any idea the

148
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,979
potential of value at the time you think

149
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,918
they're gonna give little people that

150
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:18,050
much money power no and so what we want

151
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,579
to work on is regional power we want to

152
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,110
work on being able to have the regions

153
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:22,370
in California that have outdoor

154
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,160
situations without going into a

155
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,689
different models different markets but

156
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,300
the outdoor models will be able to have

157
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:32,329
region specific cultivar specific so say

158
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,280
you have that Clementine ah squash and

159
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:35,000
you take that and you go into a

160
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,459
genomically

161
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,470
because yours you chase it you chase it

162
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:41,029
out you find the variety that goes into

163
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,650
outdoor production and pretty soon

164
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:45,168
you're able to license it and the farms

165
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:47,689
in a specific geographical regions that

166
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:50,029
are suitable to produce it you make

167
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:51,350
money on it the market gets it the

168
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:54,619
market should get it at a better price

169
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,000
point and in terms of the outdoor

170
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,240
production because cost of production is

171
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,560
lower and you're going to have less

172
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,509
consistency more variability because

173
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,310
climate will affect it but ultimately

174
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,389
you'll be able to get products out that

175
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:10,939
work off of these pieces

176
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:13,539
that product between turf distract from

177
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:13,540
that yeah

178
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:33,889
oh cool and it's kind of neat I got the

179
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,860
Tofino the one that took the more after

180
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:40,279
the Oz and then the one that took more

181
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,389
after the more the orange one more after

182
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:46,609
the fuel but the fuel version has

183
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:49,459
absolutely no fungal propensity

184
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,350
whatsoever so this was the one that we

185
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,219
want to run outdoor because when you put

186
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,189
them both together

187
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,870
the first variant was which was which is

188
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,040
to me I like it a little more in

189
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,750
extracts I like you going a little bit

190
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,189
more on the orange tone but the second

191
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,920
one has more than gas with the orange

192
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:05,870
flow through it both on the stellar both

193
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,650
of them Award winners it's just what you

194
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:11,300
like his preference with the Oz one more

195
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:13,250
fungally prone so in a buffered space

196
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,579
indoor not an issue with that shit

197
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,230
outside man you have a trick but the the

198
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:21,469
second one that we did you know a year

199
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:24,110
later radically different full rainstorm

200
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,570
on it and no problems no botrytis no

201
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,100
p.m. issues so you want to copy that

202
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:30,079
if you guys want to I can throw you one

203
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,340
of those and the same thing - it's in

204
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:36,680
probably three people's hands right now

205
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:47,449
you know I mean that's gassy I can smell

206
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:50,509
the mandarine Antho - beautiful no

207
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,979
because with skittle by itself it it's I

208
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:53,689
think skittle by itself makes some of

209
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,189
the nice ice best ice hash you've ever

210
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:57,139
smoked

211
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:59,209
so when Brandon started washing that

212
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,579
stuff initially and we started smoking

213
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:04,899
that really high level skittle ice hash

214
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:07,129
I would he was he was competing in

215
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:10,159
concentrating cups with that ice ash and

216
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,750
and and doing well they had a quality

217
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,050
with superior so I was like wow that's

218
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:17,180
where it shines but it doesn't have a

219
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,889
long hold ability so when you smoke it

220
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,560
you kind of come down off the quick and

221
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,879
then when the Oscars got into it that's

222
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,060
when it really was cherry

223
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,060
yeah

224
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:31,658
the frosted with a low bar you know

225
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:35,918
fever - next we have a great strawberry

226
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:38,168
cream holy

227
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,149
that's that strawberry yeah but I have a

228
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:42,129
no strawberry banana that that when you

229
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,599
make it into a rosin same thing it's

230
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:45,509
full strawberry in the mouth with that

231
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,680
heavy ah sameen banana that just flows

232
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:49,208
yeah it's brown

233
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:53,289
yeah that's brownie I noticed that too

234
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:55,449
yeah a little-little brownie but sandy

235
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:56,980
sandy resin you guys get like this a

236
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,720
greedy like they have the resin off the

237
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,570
plants gritty it almost looks like

238
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:16,899
oversize like like like sugar chunks

239
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:18,519
yummy salt yeah yeah it's no I got it we

240
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,500
got it in culture yeah we plug it but no

241
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:26,649
matter what it does it'll always be a

242
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,789
fragile frame more prone to pathogen

243
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,009
issue plant because that's just what it

244
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:32,860
is genetically that's just who you are

245
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,480
no nope it's stable it's it's I have the

246
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,970
shy have the sure burden of it that

247
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,649
that's the that's the parent of and so

248
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,420
it was which was ironic cuz a buddy of

249
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,889
mine goes to sure Vince he gets a cut

250
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:43,120
from him he brings it back and says here

251
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:46,809
this was the sherab that we're we're

252
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,639
grabbing for you and so another buddy of

253
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:51,578
mine gets the sherab cut from Jigga and

254
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,169
it's the dark it's the dark shirt and so

255
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:54,939
I have one that says pale green but when

256
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:56,259
Jigga come up and said bro he goes you

257
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,480
got this the one he goes that's what's

258
00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:00,399
directly connected to the skittle and so

259
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,560
I already mapped it and we thought that

260
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,240
the sure was the parent of the skittle

261
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,759
that the skittle was an s-1 in my mind

262
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,009
the skittle was an s-1 of the sherbet

263
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:12,519
was someone got a sherbet cut and then

264
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:16,750
they self tit and out came the

265
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:19,539
intensified orange flavored runty

266
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,669
genetic plant right and lo and behold

267
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:23,620
when we DNA mapped it

268
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:26,528
neasha on the head scientist from

269
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,089
Philo's he can look at the plants and

270
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:30,909
figure out where the transference was

271
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,589
and what he says is the skittle is the

272
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:35,708
parent one of the parents yes a no male

273
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:37,760
a female you can't tell but it is the

274
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,500
parent of that sherbert

275
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,149
and so when you smoke that sure but it

276
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,519
has an orangey flavor so you you get

277
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:45,529
that get that cut off of me and if you

278
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,360
turn it into a concentrate it's very

279
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:49,519
skittle like because the skittle is the

280
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:55,730
parent but it's got sherbert potential

281
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,240
killer killer killer grower yeah

282
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,820
beautiful

283
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,139
you have like 53 days totally yeah no

284
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,580
it's not it's not a long cycle I think

285
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:03,580
the others were like around 60
