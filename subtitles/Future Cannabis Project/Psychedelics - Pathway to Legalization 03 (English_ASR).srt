2
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:22,920
my name is dr. Cole marcha I went to

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:26,219
medical school in Chicago and I did a

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,510
residency at UCLA VA program did a lot

5
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:33,058
of work with people with PTSD II knew

6
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,670
about maps from actually a really long

7
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,729
time ago and sort of caught back up with

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,300
them when I was in medical school and

9
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:45,468
sort of been sort of making my big life

10
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:47,819
choices based on trying to align my

11
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:53,789
direction of my ship with the direction

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:56,549
of maps of ship and we collide and so I

13
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,640
graduated from residency 2015 I've been

14
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:02,718
in private practice doing actually

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,430
primarily ketamine for depression and

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,950
the opportunity to be involved in the

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,250
maps MDMA for PTSD research has been

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,780
sort of the dream since 2010 I've been

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,310
actively pursuing and trying to get a

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:21,420
site here in Los Angeles and my goal is

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,390
for to get as many people involved and

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,849
to make Los Angeles specifically like a

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,909
an epicenter for the psychedelic

24
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:32,030
movement and medicine and and anywhere

25
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,030
else

26
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,810
let's see how I'll do a quick little

27
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,779
recap like you did so I used to be an

28
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,368
oceanographer for nine years I worked in

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,478
marine science and environmental work

30
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:55,540
and about five or six years ago I had

31
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,590
some pretty big experiences with some of

32
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,810
the things that we've been talking about

33
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:02,259
here and really shifted my perspective

34
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:05,920
and and got me interested in advocacy

35
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:08,139
and educational work around psychedelics

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,909
and drug policy so I started a

37
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,889
psychedelic society called the aware

38
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:15,159
project rethinking psychedelics and we

39
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:16,899
have been running monthly events for the

40
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,900
last three years here in Los Angeles we

41
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,670
also have a sister organization called

42
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,860
the inner space integration which is a

43
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:26,139
integration support program for people

44
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:30,519
who have had big psychedelic experiences

45
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:32,439
and need help coming and organizing

46
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,150
their thoughts around what what kind of

47
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:37,030
came up for them during their experience

48
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,760
so we have monthly integration circles

49
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,459
all around the city for that and through

50
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:46,929
my work with the aware project I got

51
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:48,789
unconnected to coal and and maps and we

52
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,390
did a couple of fundraisers for for maps

53
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:54,669
and and then I got invited to come be

54
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:56,828
the study coordinator for the clinical

55
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:59,500
trial of mdma-assisted therapy for the

56
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:02,260
treatment of PTSD so I'm thrilled to be

57
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,389
part of the team and we just opened

58
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:08,259
enrollment for our phase 3 clinical

59
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:16,419
trials last week so we've finally opened

60
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:19,899
phase 3 it's very exciting it's huge and

61
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:21,789
I'm also getting a switching careers and

62
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,539
getting a Masters in Social Work now

63
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:29,679
just like Natalie to become a therapist

64
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:34,750
and eventually get on the team so I am

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:39,010
on the team but be a therapist so

66
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,169
waiting for me to come graduates and

67
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,060
phase 3 does that way you know what like

68
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:45,209
the significance of phase 3 as opposed

69
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:50,229
to phase 7 or

70
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:56,050
jealously feaces yeah so in psychiatry

71
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:59,019
in particular phase 1 2 3 phase 1 this

72
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:02,500
is FDA research specifically how a drug

73
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,780
goes from an idea to on the market phase

74
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,379
one is that you first have to

75
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,979
demonstrate that the drug is safe so

76
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:14,500
it's given to healthy volunteers that's

77
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:18,969
where a lot of that the research was

78
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,769
done sort of for us for people

79
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,410
interested in researching MDMA and and

80
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:26,680
cannabis because there was so much money

81
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,950
spent exploring the dangers that a lot

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,040
of that data was already there so then

83
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,959
phase 2 is the first time you apply your

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,370
actual theory like we think it's going

85
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,759
to be helpful for this particular

86
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,850
condition and we're going to you know

87
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,449
take people with this condition and who

88
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:48,220
typically run out of other options and

89
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,039
give them this potential you know

90
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,140
potential new treatments so usually it's

91
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,840
double-blind placebo-controlled and it's

92
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:59,430
the first time you get you get to see

93
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:02,379
whether you're this idea holds any water

94
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:05,230
there were a handful of phase 2 trials

95
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:08,759
actually done all sponsored by maps for

96
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:13,870
for mdma-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD

97
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:16,349
and then phase 3 is when you try to show

98
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,199
that that wasn't just like a lucky

99
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,270
occurrence in one place or something

100
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,009
unique to in this case like South

101
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:27,519
Carolina where the first study was done

102
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:31,269
but it's something you can expand that

103
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,729
you also part of phase 3 is having a

104
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:36,159
plan in place to actually provide all of

105
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:39,220
that drug to the market should it come

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,390
to market because we don't want to you

107
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,490
know go through all this trouble and

108
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:47,829
then nobody will manufacture MDMA and

109
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:49,810
everybody's waiting around so so that's

110
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:54,909
where we're at we're in the very last

111
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:58,540
step like phase 3 is we are showing that

112
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:01,390
it can be done not just in one place the

113
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:05,830
results were amazing in the face to data

114
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:09,329
and then yeah so phase three is I think

115
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:17,169
we have 14 locations 12 or 14 locations

116
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:21,099
and Los Angeles is one and and yeah

117
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:23,350
we're gonna see I think like 200 people

118
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:27,490
in total we're gonna do actually two

119
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:30,430
phase three studies but essentially if

120
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,569
we can reproduce data even close to what

121
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,480
we did with Phase two

122
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:38,909
like it's gonna be an available drug

123
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:43,290
it's like it's right at the finish line

124
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,290
and following up on what you said

125
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,220
congratulations but following up on what

126
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,719
you said that you know somebody's got to

127
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,010
build it you said there's already an

128
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,560
infrastructure in place for the

129
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,959
production of MDMA can you tell us more

130
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,610
about that

131
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:01,000
[Music]

132
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,100
there there's a contract between maps

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:14,740
and a particular drug manufacturer I'm

134
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:17,080
not sure the name yeah and and it has to

135
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,600
be made by something called good

136
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,430
manufacturing practices so the place

137
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,189
manufacturing the drug if it's gonna be

138
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,019
available to a broad market it has to

139
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:29,230
meet all of these standards of the FDA

140
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:30,549
so up until phase three because you

141
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,180
don't know if it's really gonna work out

142
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,460
or not it's not as important but for

143
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,400
Phase three you have to have a

144
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:41,319
manufacturer it has to be made in the

145
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,359
same way it's going to be made and has

146
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,839
to be manufactured in a place that's up

147
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:51,550
to FDA standards so that was actually a

148
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:53,289
big a big adventure and I'll jump in and

149
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,840
just say a little bit more about phase

150
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,200
three which was that it's kind of unique

151
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,879
in in maps applying to do phase three

152
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,670
because they went to the FDA and they

153
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,668
said okay we want to do one study with

154
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:09,669
around 200 people to show efficacy for

155
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:11,939
this drug and the FDA was like we've

156
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:13,919
never seen

157
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:16,949
a phase three trial that just has one

158
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,640
study and with so few people but because

159
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:23,099
the effect size meaning you know most

160
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,579
drugs you know that's a you it's a very

161
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,379
small effect size in terms of seeing if

162
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:29,879
it makes a difference or not and so they

163
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,980
have to have a very large number of

164
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,200
people thousands of people typically to

165
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,120
see if that is that is a significant

166
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,060
effect size but because our effect size

167
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,269
is so big we need such a smaller amount

168
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,759
of number of people I mean for the Phase

169
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:47,819
two clinical trials it's between seven

170
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:50,939
between 60 to 80 percent of people after

171
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:56,190
three rounds of mdma-assisted

172
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:59,580
psychotherapy did not show any where did

173
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:04,170
not qualify for PTSD afterwards after

174
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:06,330
three sessions so that's huge and so so

175
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,610
the anyway Maps went back to the FDA and

176
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,379
said okay well we're not gonna do one

177
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,350
study then we're gonna do two studies

178
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,759
but with 100 each so it's basically the

179
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,500
same number of people but they made it

180
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,389
into two studies and they're like okay

181
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:33,779
we'll prove that so it's a little funny

182
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:36,990
that so there's a specific protocol that

183
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,100
we go through that we take all of our

184
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,680
participants through and there's a

185
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,379
several screening criteria that everyone

186
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,299
has to meet and for them to be safe to

187
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:46,830
be able to enter into the trial and they

188
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:51,179
take lots of different kinds of tests

189
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:54,780
and so then they have three integration

190
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:58,169
or three preparation meetings with a CO

191
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:00,600
therapy team so each participant is

192
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:04,649
paired up with two a male and female

193
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,970
Kothari's not your typical individual

194
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:21,120
therapy but you are actually working

195
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:23,790
with a pair yeah yeah that's a change we

196
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:33,850
can have female female through

197
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:35,049
I'll have to talk about that so so the

198
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,379
participants go through three

199
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:40,059
preparation sessions and then which is

200
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:43,419
about an hour and a half

201
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:47,619
sessions and then one month apart they

202
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:50,110
have an all-day MDMA experience with

203
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,110
their therapy team and these are spaced

204
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,310
one month apart with three integration

205
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,580
sessions between them

206
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:59,949
so in all they're getting three

207
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,150
preparation and in DMA then 3

208
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,000
integration then it might have even a

209
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:07,809
300 and then the whole protocol takes

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,740
about four months screening time can

211
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:17,469
vary a little bit but it's a you know

212
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:19,720
it's a very efficient therapy yeah yeah

213
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,980
it's and it's a big time investment I

214
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,990
think it's important to communicate that

215
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:33,070
it's a therapy model the the MDMA

216
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:36,970
certainly is a powerful part of the of

217
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:40,900
the whole picture but it's the therapy

218
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:43,810
model is you know it's the reason for

219
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,879
all of those visits it's the the MDMA

220
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:49,869
sort of supercharges the therapy in a

221
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:52,450
way there's there's a trusting and a

222
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:57,310
bonding between the the therapists and

223
00:11:52,450 --> 00:12:02,259
the participants I I'm guessing that

224
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:05,259
that's what happens that is just much

225
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:07,870
much harder to achieve in without that

226
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:09,460
particular aide and for people who are

227
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,220
talking about the worst thing that's

228
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,269
ever happened to them it takes a lot of

229
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:18,610
trust and a lot of bonding and a lot of

230
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:20,919
trust primarily and one of the things

231
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,500
that then makes this so effective is

232
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:26,049
that is that a therapy because in the

233
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,659
integration work that I do through inner

234
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:30,209
space integration we see that people

235
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:32,230
that have experimented either

236
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:36,850
recreational with these things or maybe

237
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,300
done underground therapy that they're

238
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,129
not

239
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:42,159
getting you know either any integration

240
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:45,009
any preparation or not enough and people

241
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,708
either are just not prepared for what

242
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:49,870
can come up for them and so having it in

243
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:52,359
this context creates such a level of

244
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:56,139
safety especially with people that have

245
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,990
severe trauma really makes this very

246
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:02,230
effective I wanted to ask you to

247
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,759
elaborate on the preparation and the

248
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,528
integration and what does it look like

249
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:12,039
if you're a patient you know what does

250
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:14,230
it feel like the preparation the

251
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,480
preparation integration visits are going

252
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,889
to look very similar but obviously at

253
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,350
different points in the process and it's

254
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:27,659
the room the our particular study room

255
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:33,009
is it doesn't look like a hospital room

256
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:35,379
it's it's cozy it's inviting the

257
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:39,939
therapists pairs usually address pretty

258
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:43,889
casual like this and and the first three

259
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:47,459
sessions are getting to know each other

260
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:51,490
building rapport building a relationship

261
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:56,379
talking about boundaries and talking

262
00:13:51,490 --> 00:14:00,190
about talking about at at some point

263
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:03,549
talking about the trauma itself and then

264
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,430
the integration can be and those are

265
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:10,689
about 90-minute visits after the MDMA

266
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:13,239
sessions the integration can can really

267
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,220
vary as far as what comes up it can be

268
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,169
about what came up in the medicine

269
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,629
session itself it can be about what's

270
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:22,958
continuing to unfold in the days

271
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:27,519
afterward or in attempts to like apply

272
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:30,609
insights into their real life or yeah it

273
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:36,370
can really be all over the place and the

274
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:40,839
the therapy model is very non directive

275
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:43,839
or or participant directed its we're not

276
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:46,029
telling people what to do or what's the

277
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,070
right way to think about what happened

278
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:50,850
to them in fact that would be the exact

279
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:54,150
opposite of what we're supposed to

280
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:58,950
it's not we're not interpreting for them

281
00:14:54,149 --> 00:15:00,840
or or or steering it in any particular

282
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,690
direction a lot of times what comes up

283
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:07,950
for people is not what they expected to

284
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:10,280
come up a lot of times what what what it

285
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:13,500
may be a very healing experience to have

286
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,149
isn't what they thought it was going to

287
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,000
be when they went in and so it's just

288
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,769
supporting what's the therapists are

289
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,720
trying to support what's happening

290
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:24,870
naturally for the for the participant

291
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,540
and whatever way that requires and can

292
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:30,240
you tell us about like the all-day

293
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:32,429
therapy session with the medicine what

294
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,039
is the dosage you know what is it like

295
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:37,469
for participants like I'm you know my

296
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,809
experience is limited to I guess like

297
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,910
the night club ecstasy contacts with

298
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:46,679
people rolling nobody's rolling at these

299
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:49,199
things are they I'm not sure what the

300
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:53,669
typical like night club dose is supposed

301
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:57,020
to be but I'd guess around a hundred

302
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:57,019
milligrams or something

303
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:01,110
[Music]

304
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:12,689
so somebody pays like twenty bucks for a

305
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:28,009
pillow at a party so to answer the

306
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:30,900
question yeah so when they first come in

307
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:33,120
there's just general orientation to the

308
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:38,490
room and review of what's gonna happen

309
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:41,339
and they take 120 milligrams and the in

310
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:44,360
the study that we most recently did and

311
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:48,150
a potential booster of 60 milligrams

312
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:51,210
after 90 minutes or 90 minutes to two

313
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:55,500
hours we check in with them and there's

314
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:57,120
a potential booster of 50% more has been

315
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,730
consistent through all of the studies

316
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,590
but it's varied from a hundred to start

317
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,629
with a 50 booster

318
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:08,390
there were some dose finding studies

319
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:11,670
specifically but yeah that's pretty much

320
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:18,170
that's the default default is that

321
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:22,259
people take the bonus and yeah there's I

322
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:27,960
think we've had a participant that

323
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:36,000
didn't take it at one time most of the

324
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:37,890
time they do dr. Marta was describing

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,740
you know it's really not directed by the

326
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:43,050
therapist but so therapists often invite

327
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,839
the participant to go inside and put on

328
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:48,599
a blindfold and listen to music and

329
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,189
that's often how this process starts and

330
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,529
sometimes the you know the session is

331
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,509
like four to six hours long and

332
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,879
sometimes hours of that session people

333
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:58,950
are just like listening to music lying

334
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,240
down with the blindfold on and it's

335
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,029
really I've had the privilege of

336
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,789
watching videos of people like dr. Marta

337
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:07,740
doing the therapy and it's amazing to

338
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:08,849
watch people literally their body like

339
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,950
they'll be lying they're like moving

340
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:13,289
their body is releasing stuff crying

341
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,730
laughing like you know sometimes they'll

342
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:16,859
sit up all of a sudden and take it off

343
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,839
and want to start speaking and there's

344
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,729
just really such varied ways that

345
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,980
they're processing and then after that

346
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,710
is over you know spending the night at

347
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,349
the sleeping over is a really nice piece

348
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,329
of a way to like close it out because I

349
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:32,369
know when I people always say to me you

350
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:34,559
know after doing MDMA I have the worst

351
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:36,809
down the next day I feel terrible all

352
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,329
this stuff and in our studies we really

353
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:41,220
haven't seen that happen and I do

354
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:42,750
suspect when people are telling that to

355
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,009
me they're also like drinking and

356
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,930
partying all night and then go back to

357
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:48,750
work on Monday so there's some other

358
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,670
things in play but I do think in our

359
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,529
studies when people have a really

360
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,210
nourishing dinner spend the night in the

361
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:55,649
space have another session in the

362
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,710
morning with the therapist it's like

363
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,269
kind of closes it out and and and can

364
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,590
creates a container that I don't know if

365
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:03,480
you guys have seen it but I certainly

366
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:05,939
don't hear of people having those like

367
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,000
down after MDMA experiences and our

368
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,100
studies well you know can also I mean

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,019
it's maybe a little hard to tell if

370
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,319
they're having a Down or not because

371
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,879
they

372
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,240
they're going through in a really

373
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:22,390
emotional process right so even if you

374
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,190
know the even if there wasn't it down

375
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,750
from the MDMA it'd be kind of hard to

376
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,870
tell if you know because they're

377
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:33,130
processing you know examined in the

378
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:39,000
moment in their lives so yeah yeah it's

379
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:42,429
hard work I mean it's not easy to do and

380
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,640
I applaud the people that have the

381
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:47,860
courage to do it and they really are

382
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,929
yeah addressing the worst thing that's

383
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:55,990
ever happened to them in a very like

384
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:58,360
face-to-face kind of way so it's very

385
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,659
common for there to be a lot of ups and

386
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:06,129
downs especially after the first

387
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:10,080
experience the first of the three or

388
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:13,260
actually the first where there's a big

389
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:17,079
confrontation of of the trauma sometimes

390
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:19,230
I've seen I've watched a lot of videos

391
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:21,908
too and as part of our training

392
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,339
sometimes the first session people are a

393
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:27,880
little more reluctant to open up still

394
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:32,859
it takes again a lot of trust and a lot

395
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:36,039
of safety a feeling of safety but yeah

396
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:40,928
like it's hard to judge whether that

397
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:42,519
that day after thing is is something

398
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:44,950
that we're actually seeing clinically

399
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,079
because there are so many things that

400
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,370
could explain any state after any

401
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:54,490
session and it really is a continuingly

402
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:57,399
unfolding process like it's not once

403
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,548
they're engaged in the treatment they

404
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,190
need a lot of support both when they're

405
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:06,579
at their visits and when they're not at

406
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:09,340
their visits because again they're

407
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:12,788
confronting something that by definition

408
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:16,629
I mean it's like part of the description

409
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:20,609
of PTSD as a syndrome that it's

410
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:22,060
something they avoid dealing with so

411
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:26,319
yeah

412
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:29,149
it can be kind of erratic I guess that

413
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,490
so I'm I guess I have like so many

414
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,610
questions this is very fascinating for

415
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,130
me you know have you thought about doing

416
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:43,459
like longer-term studies have you

417
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:45,020
considered that and for the first there

418
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,980
there's been efforts to get longer-term

419
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:53,920
data as far as you know how the how the

420
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:57,170
effects good or bad maintain and I

421
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,830
believe the first study that was done

422
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:03,680
there was a follow-up a long-term

423
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:07,609
follow-up and it varied based on when

424
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,769
people had entered the study but for the

425
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:12,199
most part you know the the changes are

426
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:15,200
sustained like a lot long after I think

427
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,710
the average duration or the average time

428
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,240
period after the last session in the

429
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,980
particular study I'm thinking of was

430
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,049
like two and a half years was the

431
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,970
average amount of time some people like

432
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:28,069
eight years since there they stopped

433
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,039
their sessions and the majority of

434
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:31,879
people I don't remember the exact

435
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,720
numbers but the majority of people

436
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:42,410
having maintained the benefits of they

437
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:45,200
have as you were saying before it's like

438
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,519
this process and framework so because of

439
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,819
that the results are often better

440
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:51,589
further out from the study both like not

441
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:53,629
a meet immediately after people also

442
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:56,299
don't call five for PTSD but then months

443
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,190
later their PTSD score decreases and

444
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,919
then the long-term follow-up study that

445
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,870
dr. Martha is referring to also board

446
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,250
that out which is just like unheard of

447
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:08,869
and other kinds of psychiatric

448
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:11,539
intervention so yeah in a way what we're

449
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:14,959
doing you know in in how different this

450
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:17,629
is from typical pharmaceuticals is that

451
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,940
instead of masking symptoms we're really

452
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,830
getting to the core of what people what

453
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,840
people are feeling in the pain that

454
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:26,899
they're feeling in the suffering and so

455
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:29,240
and addressing that directly so and you

456
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,310
know you're also kind of teaching people

457
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,049
how to heal themselves and so I think

458
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,879
that might be kind of what's

459
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:37,819
contributing to

460
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,830
the sustained and an even in long-term

461
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:42,168
improve continued improvement because

462
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:44,778
you've started to teach people how to

463
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:46,100
address what all the feelings that have

464
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:48,319
come that they've been kind of

465
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:50,119
suppressing or and allowing them to

466
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,038
teach them how to bring them up in a

467
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:58,038
healthy way and to be able to process

468
00:23:52,038 --> 00:24:00,109
them in a manageable way I think self

469
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,028
healing I want to bring this concept of

470
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:04,548
inner healing intelligence or inner

471
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:06,380
healer which is something that the Maps

472
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:08,298
framework speaks about a lot and

473
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,070
introduces to the people who are working

474
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:12,288
with to kind of have that concept of

475
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:14,148
like listening to your inner healer and

476
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,669
what that means for you to lead the

477
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:20,959
healing process yourself and not to come

478
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:23,750
from somewhere external good point so

479
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,629
set in setting are very important for

480
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,599
the psychedelic experience and I I'm

481
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:30,949
thinking back to my experiences with

482
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:32,839
ecstasy back in law school it's like we

483
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,879
would always take vitamin C because I

484
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:36,678
don't know if it was actually the real

485
00:24:34,878 --> 00:24:38,599
deal but they're supposed to heighten

486
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,970
the experience and maybe like you know

487
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:43,548
reduce the crash effect do you do

488
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:47,450
anything like that to prepare people for

489
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:51,619
the experience we don't have anything

490
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:53,389
specific you know we want people to take

491
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:59,778
care of themselves prior to coming in

492
00:24:53,388 --> 00:25:02,959
and we have refreshments and snacks

493
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:06,490
available on hand general like self-care

494
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:10,190
items but we don't have any particular

495
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:15,079
regimens I think for a number of reasons

496
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:19,460
but in in the context of a study like

497
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:22,668
this you don't want to add any possible

498
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,528
sort of introduced variables yeah

499
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:26,149
exactly variables that story thank you

500
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:28,250
you don't want to add any additional

501
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:30,408
variables that somebody could point to

502
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,298
and say oh well you know maybe it's the

503
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:36,350
vitamin C that it makes everybody better

504
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:38,028
you know so we want to control as much

505
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:39,990
as possible we try to take people off of

506
00:25:38,028 --> 00:25:44,359
all of their

507
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:47,099
they're psychiatric medications and

508
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:49,619
there are a couple you know things on

509
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,779
hand in case of emergencies but but yeah

510
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:56,729
we we don't have any particular regimens

511
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:58,379
we recommend before or after and just to

512
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,870
step back a little bit for people who

513
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,300
don't know what sentence setting is it

514
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:05,759
was a phrase that was coined in the 60s

515
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:08,369
as these things were coming into a

516
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:11,039
public forefront and the idea is that

517
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:12,479
your set is your mindset so whatever

518
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,420
you're kind of coming in with whether

519
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,220
it's trauma or how your day was that's

520
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,620
what you're bringing into this space and

521
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:23,970
then setting is your context that you're

522
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:25,649
doing the experience and so psychedelics

523
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,890
seem to kind of make you a little bit

524
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:31,500
more permeable to whatever it was kind

525
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,120
of going on underneath in your internal

526
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,460
system but also what's going on and

527
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,549
externally and so the ideas that we're

528
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,740
trying to at least in the studies make

529
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:43,319
sure that we're helping support people

530
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,440
in both that from that psychological

531
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:48,299
perspective but also creating a

532
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,830
comfortable and safe container for them

533
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:52,919
to experience whatever they're

534
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:55,619
experiencing and Maps has another

535
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:59,130
program called the zendo project which

536
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:00,719
Cole and I have any volunteer to where

537
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,950
have all been volunteers for the zendo

538
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,529
project which is a psychedelic

539
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:08,009
opportunity and you can't do is the

540
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:11,910
psychedelic harm reduction nonprofit

541
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:16,879
that no okay like having you here here

542
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:19,350
for my back checking and they provide

543
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,470
services at festivals for people that

544
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:24,149
have had a big experience or in in midst

545
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:30,630
of a big experience and they create a

546
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:33,150
safe container for people to calm down a

547
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,550
little bit get some nourishment to get

548
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:39,509
stay warm whatever it is and so they

549
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:40,649
have volunteers that are medical

550
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:42,480
professionals mental health

551
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,400
professionals and just anyone

552
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,049
volunteering that can help support

553
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,790
people in these spaces so that we're

554
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:49,109
making sure that these people are

555
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:51,329
getting help and then that they don't

556
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:53,339
necessarily have to go to the Med tent

557
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:55,548
or get picked up by the

558
00:27:53,339 --> 00:28:02,339
just because they're tripping too hard

559
00:27:55,548 --> 00:28:03,329
but and their friends bail yeah and then

560
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:06,658
you're creating more traumatic

561
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:08,668
experiences and and you know and so many

562
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:11,100
so many things that I've experienced

563
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:12,799
sitting doing the zener project and also

564
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,240
hurt so many more experiences that

565
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:18,569
having that container with a person that

566
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,269
can compassionately listen to you really

567
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:23,609
can change a very challenging experience

568
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:27,179
into something that they find actually

569
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:29,908
that it was very in in sight and

570
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:31,230
influential so it's a really great

571
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:37,409
project so I highly recommend checking

572
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:39,628
it out and a lot of psychedelic it's a

573
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:41,820
great place to learn you know legal

574
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:47,248
contacts and people and and kind of

575
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:49,099
learn I would highly recommend it it's a

576
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:54,899
really awesome experience anybody

577
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:57,058
interested and that's that kind of if

578
00:28:54,898 --> 00:28:59,638
you're if you're oriented that way

579
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:01,378
towards trying to help people in crisis

580
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:05,189
like that it's a really great way to do

581
00:29:01,378 --> 00:29:09,118
it and meet really awesome people it's a

582
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:11,700
it's a peer support service there's you

583
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:13,589
know access to medical if things you

584
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,980
know we're more difficult or complicated

585
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:22,378
but but yeah it's it's a peer support

586
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:24,868
service and and I think it changes a lot

587
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:26,398
of people's lives really a lot of people

588
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:34,439
who end up in there instead of being

589
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:36,719
arrested like PTSD study you know and a

590
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,740
lot of them a lot of people who have

591
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,950
come in as guests of the zendo have come

592
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,159
back as volunteers there is a really

593
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,159
cool

594
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:52,659
so I just want to prep everybody out

595
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,180
here we want to make this a little bit

596
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:58,330
participatory so if anybody has any

597
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:05,920
questions or comments or in we got the

598
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:09,039
backward can you guys come maybe up to

599
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,960
help therapists connect more with their

600
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,059
patients I was wondering if you can

601
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,400
speak to that and if there's any studies

602
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:19,470
coming up that kind of integrates the

603
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,470
therapist into the experience as well

604
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:27,879
[Music]

605
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,519
was actually developed by Merck a

606
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,759
pharmaceutical company in 1912 and it

607
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:42,250
was developed to be like a blood nothing

608
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:46,839
to do with therapy and then it kind of

609
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:49,690
really cool again then introduced like

610
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:55,029
kind of it's still unclear to me how he

611
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:56,710
like knew that kind of might be helpful

612
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:58,660
to therapists but then I think that's

613
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,029
maybe what you're thinking of that it

614
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,830
was first introduced in like among

615
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:05,109
therapists it wasn't first like a party

616
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:07,689
drug was first given literally by this

617
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:09,069
chemist to therapists across the country

618
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,410
saying why don't you try this with your

619
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:14,079
clients and that's how it kind of spread

620
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,880
yeah it didn't go through the process

621
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:19,319
we're going through now and it wasn't

622
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:23,290
illegal yet so it was just sort of like

623
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:27,399
Shogun was respected brilliant person

624
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:29,200
who had doctor friends and so I can

625
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:35,620
imagine that it could have been used in

626
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:40,870
that way and but and actually a lot of

627
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:42,909
the therapists that that received MDMA

628
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:45,369
and used it in those early days I think

629
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:48,450
primarily did couples therapy and that's

630
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:51,039
a lot of that has sort of seeped into

631
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,350
the way that we are trained now like the

632
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,230
I believe that male-female therapy team

633
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:58,779
came from a model that was for married

634
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:02,400
couples from the MDMA because they

635
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:07,089
advised a lot of like a lot of the

636
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:10,570
therapy model and the technique a lot of

637
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:12,689
those psychiatrists helped to sort of

638
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:16,000
develop the process that we're using now

639
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,529
because they're still around and we're

640
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,009
pretty bummed on that tool got taken

641
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:22,839
away from them I like the premise of the

642
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:24,730
question and I wish therapists were

643
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:26,230
allowed to use MDMA with their patients

644
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,839
I think that they might be able to bond

645
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:31,059
even more quickly well and I'll say one

646
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:34,000
more thing is then maps did make a way

647
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:36,039
for therapists to experience what MDMA

648
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,990
is like so that they can have a greater

649
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,519
level of understanding of what their

650
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,490
patients are going through so they have

651
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,930
a study going on right now and their

652
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,579
plans to be more studies where the

653
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,920
therapists get taken through sort of an

654
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:51,189
abbreviated version of the of the

655
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,779
protocol that that our participants are

656
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,519
going through so where they're the

657
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:56,500
participant they're the participant and

658
00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:03,579
that they get to do the MDMA with to

659
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:06,039
therapy their therapy giving healthy

660
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:07,929
volunteers MDMA just so they can

661
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:17,500
understand how to be yeah it's a very

662
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:19,660
different model more safety data and so

663
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,890
I was gonna ask about the zendo project

664
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:25,090
that you guys are just talking about

665
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:26,710
I've actually signed up online to be to

666
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:28,629
be notified I guess when those volunteer

667
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,640
opportunities I don't see a lot of stuff

668
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:32,200
come through there and I have seen the

669
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,570
downloadable training manual but I

670
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:38,049
wasn't sure if there was face-to-face

671
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:40,349
training locally or if there was kind of

672
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:42,819
a more immediate way to get involved I

673
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:44,109
don't think that there are local

674
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:52,720
trainings but there

675
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:54,069
there is someone in Chicago there that's

676
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,808
a really great question and they

677
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:57,879
basically have been responding to people

678
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:59,558
like you you know wanting to have more

679
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,000
access to the training so they've

680
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:03,190
actually done one I think in Portland

681
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,049
one in Chicago and they're going to be

682
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:10,510
developing more but you're based in LA

683
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:13,269
yeah I think also you know they're there

684
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,800
they work and like burning man after all

685
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:16,059
actually no longer at Africa burn you

686
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,129
know because they supported the groups

687
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:21,009
there so they're trying to kind of go to

688
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:23,440
more training actually unless outreach

689
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:29,020
so hopefully you should could do an LA

690
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:31,480
training the home bases that I believe

691
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:33,190
they're gonna continue to do sort of in

692
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,199
perpetuity at least right now are

693
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:38,470
lightning in a bottle and vision and

694
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:41,439
Burning Man so thank you so much yeah

695
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:43,719
would be a good way locally to dip your

696
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,608
toes in okay great thank you know

697
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:50,259
coordinator based in LA well accordin

698
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:56,648
well connected a couple yes several Z

699
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:59,170
and do project org hey guys thank you so

700
00:34:56,648 --> 00:35:03,309
much for everything you're doing for us

701
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:05,250
so thank you Omar thanks okay I've got a

702
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:08,889
question for you on the criteria of

703
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:12,219
research facilities and I'll put it in a

704
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:16,868
hypothetical scenario like let's say you

705
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:19,629
have a retreat center right I'm not

706
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:21,608
gonna say like esslyn or maybe some of

707
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,460
our Northern California farms that are

708
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:26,799
transitioning from cannabis farms into

709
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,449
you know retreats and spaces where you

710
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,289
know we're sort of like licensing

711
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:33,969
certain things can we register to work

712
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:36,519
with maps and or other research

713
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:39,159
organizations to do set setting guided

714
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,789
meditations and long-term retreats and

715
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:42,639
PTSD

716
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:45,009
you know healing like not just for weeks

717
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,809
but for months residency things of that

718
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,450
nature I mean it would that be a viable

719
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:52,320
business model for us to sort of strive

720
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:54,189
for in the future or do you see that I

721
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,940
hope so

722
00:35:54,190 --> 00:36:00,179
that's the dream for a lot of people

723
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:03,759
myself included is that we would have

724
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:07,058
places like that but yeah we're still in

725
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:10,449
the getting it legalized part or at

726
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:12,400
least the the treatment part but you

727
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:14,558
know once it once it is an available

728
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,930
treatment then yeah you can you could be

729
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:21,190
able to create a specialized retreat

730
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:23,348
place that it almost be like short-term

731
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:25,119
living because it you know several

732
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:28,088
months long but I think it would be

733
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,240
great for people to be immersed and have

734
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:34,739
other healthy activities to fill their

735
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:36,699
day with because yeah it's hard to

736
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:40,479
especially people who are coming out of

737
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:41,949
just traumatic environments you know an

738
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,269
eight-hour session sounds like a long

739
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:47,348
time of therapy but you know the other

740
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:49,808
hundred some-odd hours of the week

741
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:52,630
they're you know listening to gun shots

742
00:36:49,809 --> 00:37:00,190
and trying to make it safely to the bus

743
00:36:52,630 --> 00:37:02,140
or whatever the research is kind of as

744
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:05,200
we're kind of set for Phase three

745
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:06,608
research spaces but before we have full

746
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,288
approval we're actually we're actually

747
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:12,219
expecting approval for something called

748
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:13,990
expanded access so technically if if you

749
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:16,568
were to get a team together of people

750
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:18,578
that would have to be trained that go

751
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:20,798
through the MDMA therapy training and

752
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:22,960
have a Schedule one license and have the

753
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:26,710
appropriate team but if you collected a

754
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:30,369
team and had a space as soon as 2019 we

755
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:32,230
could have expanded access MDMA therapy

756
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:34,960
happening there so it's actually we're

757
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,818
really really close but right now maps

758
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,679
can't you know we've invested in

759
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:40,630
developing our different feet like Phase

760
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:42,848
three research sites but we're not going

761
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,950
to be sponsoring this expanded access

762
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:47,230
it's kind of like an add-on before

763
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:49,808
approval basically we are a grant like

764
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:51,670
this comes because there's such a huge

765
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,470
potential for treatment that they're

766
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,539
like want people to have access you know

767
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:57,368
as soon as possible and so there's that

768
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:59,950
caveat that could allow you if you

769
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:02,759
gathered your team together where would

770
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:02,759
we learn about this

771
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:07,519
say you can also email and we can like

772
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,309
will sent we can send you all thank you

773
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,769
and if I could add like right now

774
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:14,599
ketamine is a Schedule three control

775
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:17,650
substance and there's ketamine therapy

776
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:19,760
and actually you conduct some ketamine

777
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:21,349
therapy for depression can you tell us a

778
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,569
little bit more about that and I was

779
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:25,519
always curious like you know I associate

780
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:27,619
ketamine with a k-hole and falling down

781
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,608
the K hole and you know is that a

782
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:33,710
paradoxical effect of ketamine it's a

783
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:38,088
it's a potential effect of ketamine for

784
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:40,639
sure but yeah in the in the doses that

785
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:42,230
are that have been shown to be helpful

786
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:45,650
there's been a lot of studies with

787
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:47,838
ketamine for depression it's not

788
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,849
something that's likely to get go

789
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:54,219
through the phase 3 process because I

790
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:57,470
think even something like MDMA for PTSD

791
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:59,239
where we're it's all donor funded and

792
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:01,368
it's like a shoestring budget it's still

793
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:05,149
in the tens of millions of dollars so

794
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:06,619
ketamine not having any like reason to

795
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,650
invest tens of millions of dollars

796
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:11,298
there's nobody who is going to unless

797
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:14,990
anybody in here has like forty million

798
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:16,759
dollars I'll do it's just me for you but

799
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:18,558
yeah it's like forty million dollars or

800
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,960
something like that to run a phase three

801
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:26,119
study all the way through so I figure I

802
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,039
was going with that but you don't need

803
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:31,220
right because it's already scheduled

804
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:33,380
through exactly so so the the studies

805
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:35,779
that have been done there's plenty of

806
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:39,500
evidence that it's effective at a dose

807
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:42,200
that also can provide what they call a

808
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,690
dissociative or psychotic effect in

809
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:46,608
studies but it's most people have had

810
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,869
the experience and they're familiar with

811
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:50,989
psychedelics would describe it as a

812
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:53,180
psychedelic experience and those of us

813
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:56,659
trained in working with psychedelic

814
00:39:53,179 --> 00:40:00,529
States and the potential healing its I

815
00:39:56,659 --> 00:40:03,348
see it as like a sort of wasted

816
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:06,170
opportunity not to just set up a

817
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:07,849
treatment plan where we administer the

818
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,619
medicine that's been shown to be safe

819
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:11,510
and effective and also add some

820
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:12,910
psychotherapy that's been shown to be

821
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,190
safe and effective

822
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:17,980
and psychedelic experience which

823
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:21,490
psilocybin and MDMA are starting to show

824
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:23,469
may be safe and effective too so we see

825
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:26,229
very very difficult cases in my clinic

826
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:28,029
we have as good or better outcomes than

827
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:31,300
the research that's done without those

828
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:35,050
considerations in mind and I think that

829
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:37,600
that's one of the reasons why how's it

830
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:39,280
going guys I just had a quick question

831
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,339
so I've heard a lot of talk about MDMA

832
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,590
LSD psilocybin I really haven't heard a

833
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,720
lot of talk or I guess maybe research

834
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,130
maybe I'm wrong about DMT and what's

835
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,679
crazy to me is that it's the most of

836
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:52,780
like crazy of the psychedelics and it's

837
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:54,609
naturally occurring in the brain do you

838
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,800
guys have any insight on that or like

839
00:40:54,610 --> 00:41:01,660
research or anything that you have to

840
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,580
stay on that well yeah I mean DMT I mean

841
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:07,420
besides the research that Rick Strassman

842
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:09,849
has done I mean it's it's hard to to

843
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:13,300
know what the the therapeutic value is

844
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:15,969
but it's it's it's a little bit hard to

845
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,340
contain whereas with something like

846
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:20,289
psilocybin where it's milder and you've

847
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:23,170
got a longer working time whereas in

848
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:26,769
supposed to you know the DMT experiences

849
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:29,139
that people may have in recreationally

850
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:30,880
you know it was a five minute inhaled

851
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:31,449
experience and you're thrown to another

852
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,890
dimension

853
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:34,929
and then you come back and it's like

854
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:38,529
okay what what just happened you know

855
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:41,369
and so I think it's gonna but also DMT

856
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:45,130
is also in the ayahuasca brew which is

857
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:47,589
shown to show lots of effects and

858
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:49,930
beneficial effects for various mental

859
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,059
health conditions so there are there is

860
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:54,179
considerable amount of research

861
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:58,299
happening socially in in places where

862
00:41:54,179 --> 00:42:04,230
ayahuasca is legal so when using it in

863
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:07,720
that context there is some not it more

864
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:10,269
retrospective and sort of survey

865
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:13,719
research around the effects are in the

866
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:15,460
benefits of five mio DMT some research

867
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:17,559
with quite a bit of studies coming out

868
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,179
of that came out of Crossroads treatment

869
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:22,179
center in Mexico that was working with

870
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:23,230
that medicine and has shown several

871
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:26,089
different things about that

872
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,519
it's just both of them

873
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,780
it's a it's very hard to fit those into

874
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:35,570
a medical model because it's it's

875
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:39,830
blasting into an another space and to be

876
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:43,130
able to can create as medical eyes that

877
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:46,429
is very hard there are people that are

878
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:48,309
maybe not so much with DMT in the in the

879
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:50,629
it's pure form

880
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:52,039
but five amino there are people that are

881
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,550
interested in in trying to figure out

882
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:57,469
either moving that through some sort of

883
00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:00,950
religious freedom movement or through a

884
00:42:57,469 --> 00:43:04,429
medical context there is a group out of

885
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:05,960
Boulder Colorado called medicinal

886
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:07,219
mindfulness and they're working with

887
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,019
Rick Strassman to do some really

888
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:14,480
interesting research with extended state

889
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:17,570
DMT but it's more for exploration in a

890
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,550
way than it is for like medical usage so

891
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,440
that's really the only way that you can

892
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,150
research these substances if it's

893
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,380
medical so even if it's like it's

894
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,670
naturally occurring in the brain and we

895
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,039
just want to figure out what the hell it

896
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:31,970
is they're doing like neuro imaging

897
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:34,369
studies with DMT at Imperial College in

898
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:36,649
London so they're actually doing a

899
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:38,210
really cool study seeing what what part

900
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,309
of your brain lights up when you see

901
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,670
entities or something what that could

902
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:44,119
mean

903
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:46,460
so as Ashley it was saying like because

904
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:49,250
there isn't a therapeutic context that

905
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,630
we've created except the ayahuasca which

906
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,730
I really appreciate you saying and I

907
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:55,700
think we can't ignore that the way

908
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:57,740
indigenous cultures have used this DMT

909
00:43:55,699 --> 00:44:00,469
medicine is in ayahuasca that's how

910
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:02,779
these appears great so at you know DMT

911
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:05,629
but it is being examined like

912
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:07,970
academically in neuroimaging and other

913
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:10,910
contexts just not in like maps is very

914
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:12,949
focused on therapeutic research so it's

915
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:14,329
just so stigmatized you know there's

916
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:16,609
very little research money out there

917
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:18,980
even for something that like the study

918
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:22,610
that we're doing there's there's there's

919
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:24,740
you're not gonna get research money from

920
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:27,110
the government to do research on

921
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:28,009
schedule on substances so that's going

922
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,340
to be one of the really interesting

923
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:32,720
things that happens when we get MDMA

924
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,850
rescheduled that's going to open up all

925
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,799
of this federal funding to be able to do

926
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:39,029
more research on MDMA and then we won't

927
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,130
have to be asking people for money

928
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:44,370
may research and doing it through a

929
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:47,340
non-profit model so then we're gonna see

930
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:48,329
this explosion of research around you

931
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,620
know the first ones that are coming

932
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:53,039
through the system is MDMA and

933
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:54,839
psilocybin so I'm we you know our

934
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,929
collective hope is that through that

935
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,250
just rescheduling it will open up so

936
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:00,480
much more money to do so much more

937
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,539
research and then that will open

938
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,860
people's interests and minds about these

939
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:07,440
things to be able to open up more

940
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:09,150
research in the future not necessarily

941
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,400
medical research but just to figure out

942
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:21,329
what the hell it is it's just big

943
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:23,970
mattias I think to conference in New

944
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:26,610
York called tearing em initiative an

945
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:32,359
Imperial College of London okay thank

946
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:35,720
you guys thank you I appreciate it hi

947
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:38,400
you guys folks talked a little bit about

948
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:42,869
stage 3 trial and needing to line up a

949
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:46,349
partner to manufacture the MDMA and also

950
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:49,170
the shortness of how you know a few

951
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:51,960
therapy sessions can can have a big

952
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:53,970
impact has it been an impediment to

953
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,170
finding a manufacturing partner someone

954
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:56,669
that's not looking to like make another

955
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,889
prozac or something I take for the rest

956
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,889
of your life and can you speak on that

957
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:11,070
gossip or anything but I know that it

958
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:15,329
makes sense that you know a small order

959
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:18,030
would go a long way and so there were

960
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:20,909
delays in getting the medicine that we

961
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:22,800
needed to do the phase 3 studies and I

962
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:25,139
don't think it was like a conspiracy or

963
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,140
anything it was just math on the side of

964
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:30,809
people who make their living doing math

965
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:34,759
and it was like that there I think there

966
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:34,759
are higher priority things for sure

967
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,660
means that it was really not like the

968
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,780
amount the quantity we're asking for it

969
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:45,149
was so small that they first feel like

970
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,019
industrial yeah first agreed to do it

971
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,940
with us because they're really

972
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:48,358
interested and then something shift I

973
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,889
mean

974
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:52,318
it wasn't as you said it wasn't because

975
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:54,509
of the MDMA and we haven't actually had

976
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,278
we have far more difficulty doing

977
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:59,639
research with marijuana than with MDMA

978
00:46:56,278 --> 00:47:01,679
based on where we can like with cannabis

979
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:04,108
we can only get it from the University

980
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:05,548
of Mississippi grown by the National

981
00:47:04,108 --> 00:47:08,460
Institute on Drug Abuse so it's like a

982
00:47:05,548 --> 00:47:11,460
government space but with MDMA we can

983
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:13,559
contract with any like they're a pharma

984
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,179
company that's a creating the chemicals

985
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:17,309
not the kind that's necessarily

986
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:18,868
developing those chemicals they're kind

987
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:21,660
of two kinds of fart when you say

988
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:24,358
pharmaceutical companies but that we

989
00:47:21,659 --> 00:47:29,608
haven't I had issues with that thank you

990
00:47:24,358 --> 00:47:31,679
I guess I thank you for being here and

991
00:47:29,608 --> 00:47:34,440
sharing all this information I have a

992
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:36,618
question where like the the studies that

993
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,700
you're participating in are there

994
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:41,999
considerations to like the endogenous

995
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:45,210
parts of the human body like so the

996
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:48,419
variance between someone who has like a

997
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:50,608
really clean digestive system enteric

998
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,528
nervous system liver all these things

999
00:47:50,608 --> 00:47:55,440
that are going to be part of the the

1000
00:47:52,528 --> 00:47:57,268
endogenous activity right so they're

1001
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,028
considerations too like the individual

1002
00:47:57,268 --> 00:48:01,798
the difference between administering

1003
00:48:00,028 --> 00:48:03,989
that dose to someone and like how much

1004
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:06,809
dopamine and serotonin they kick out and

1005
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:09,960
then post use are they looking at

1006
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:11,640
cortisol levels and then like how do how

1007
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,068
do you adjust that kind of stuff I guess

1008
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:16,679
that's what I really can and then the

1009
00:48:14,068 --> 00:48:18,659
delivery system does that change is it

1010
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:20,909
always orally administered are there any

1011
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:23,068
variants in any of these substances like

1012
00:48:20,909 --> 00:48:25,889
is there a sinus spray with MDMA would

1013
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:28,170
that change metabolism with that change

1014
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:30,989
that individualized dopamine serotonin

1015
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:32,818
and then potential kick back of cortisol

1016
00:48:30,989 --> 00:48:39,389
in the post side I know that was like a

1017
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:42,960
lot yeah you know the there's there's an

1018
00:48:39,389 --> 00:48:46,440
invitation out to kind of academia to

1019
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:49,048
throw a Don Studies on this is like in

1020
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,460
my experience in academic research this

1021
00:48:49,048 --> 00:48:53,759
kind of study is sort of like a

1022
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:56,699
mothership study that people can get

1023
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:58,929
grants for ten thousand twenty thousand

1024
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:00,460
to like like we have an ad on

1025
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:03,489
study happening with ours where we're

1026
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,800
gonna do epigenetic we're going to look

1027
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:09,729
at some epigenetic data getting some

1028
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:12,190
like DNA swabs from people or you know

1029
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:16,630
with swabs are spit you know very easy

1030
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:18,809
to add on so there's been invitation and

1031
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:21,099
that's that's pretty standard in

1032
00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:23,260
academic research I think in the earlier

1033
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:25,780
studies there probably wasn't as much to

1034
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:28,750
that cool like secondary data basically

1035
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:32,010
being collected because everybody was

1036
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:35,559
hesitant to just touch it at all but now

1037
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:38,130
there there is there's a there's a a

1038
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:41,410
pile of secondary data that's just like

1039
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:43,000
still waiting to be you know to be

1040
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:44,858
searched through I don't know it to the

1041
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,139
level of exact detail but there have

1042
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:51,250
been cortisol levels looked at oxytocin

1043
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:53,949
levels looked at vasopressin

1044
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:58,960
lots of different hormones that people

1045
00:49:53,949 --> 00:50:00,578
have different theories about and and we

1046
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,780
always collect as much like demographic

1047
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:08,519
data as we possibly can so yeah there's

1048
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:12,790
a goldmine of data to look at it's just

1049
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:14,949
the focus has been on the of our

1050
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:17,858
research in particular has been on you

1051
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:20,980
know does it work we don't we're not as

1052
00:50:17,858 --> 00:50:24,009
concerned in our specific study designs

1053
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,619
with why it works it's showing that it

1054
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:28,299
does cuz that's what's most important

1055
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:31,030
and that it's safe and then we can

1056
00:50:28,298 --> 00:50:32,559
figure all the rest out as we go then I

1057
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:34,240
guess just real quick for MDMA and

1058
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,380
ketamine oh is it just orally

1059
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,699
administrator are there any other

1060
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:39,940
delivery systems that you guys know

1061
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:43,659
about for MDMA I believe orally is all

1062
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:46,720
that's been utilized so far for ketamine

1063
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:50,379
it's been studied in a lot of different

1064
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:53,098
routes of administration majority of the

1065
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:56,260
larger studies used intravenous

1066
00:50:53,099 --> 00:51:02,109
primarily because the first studies had

1067
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:05,490
to have anesthesia all over see all

1068
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:07,838
Studies on human subjects they required

1069
00:51:05,489 --> 00:51:09,308
anesthesiologists to administer the

1070
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:10,730
ketamine because they had more

1071
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:14,330
experience with it because it come

1072
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:18,829
from anesthesiology so it was delivered

1073
00:51:14,329 --> 00:51:20,179
IV sort of historically but then lots of

1074
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:22,759
different routes of administration have

1075
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:25,339
been looked at and as far as safety goes

1076
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,280
it seems like or Alize has the least

1077
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:35,420
amount of side effect dental Assad

1078
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:36,980
profile and then you work with it in

1079
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:39,289
term usk you'll early yeah I primarily

1080
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,929
work with it intramuscularly because it

1081
00:51:39,289 --> 00:51:45,070
is delivered quickly there's not as much

1082
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:47,989
monitoring it's not as invasive as IV

1083
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:54,109
but and it has the second most amount of

1084
00:51:47,989 --> 00:51:55,429
data but orally intranasally yeah I

1085
00:51:54,108 --> 00:51:58,880
think there's even some cases of

1086
00:51:55,429 --> 00:52:01,759
suppositories thank you so much so I

1087
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,619
guess there's a complement to the like

1088
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,430
scientific and research ways of getting

1089
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:08,480
MDMA or psilocybin to be rescheduled or

1090
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:10,639
at least I'm being me at least in the

1091
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,710
United States it would it be a

1092
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,480
compromise or a complement to the

1093
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:16,550
research if there was something like a

1094
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,730
normal for psychedelics that was

1095
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,840
advocating on behalf of consumers like

1096
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:22,639
trying to push forth like

1097
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,740
decriminalization policies on local

1098
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:27,230
levels whether like the municipality or

1099
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:29,118
state law or that kind of thing like is

1100
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:30,490
it yeah I guess is that it would that be

1101
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,130
a good or bad for them have been overall

1102
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:35,659
normal like an orm oh yeah to advocate

1103
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:44,930
for consumers who are taking it outside

1104
00:52:35,659 --> 00:52:47,839
the research context I think you know

1105
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:49,759
overall definitely would be a helpful

1106
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,970
thing to have more people engaged and

1107
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,490
learning and advocating and not have

1108
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:58,629
these substances be criminalized or for

1109
00:52:55,489 --> 00:53:00,909
anyone to you know we

1110
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:03,700
not having access to them and the Cephas

1111
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:05,498
is possible so like I've definitely not

1112
00:53:03,699 --> 00:53:08,379
against something like that happening

1113
00:53:05,498 --> 00:53:11,768
but I was kind of speaking about was how

1114
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:13,739
I would think that the priority for me

1115
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:15,998
strategically would lie with those

1116
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:18,940
activists and groups connecting more

1117
00:53:15,998 --> 00:53:21,879
broadly with with people working to end

1118
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:24,880
the war on drugs and not just take out

1119
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,249
psychedelics but to say how can we as

1120
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,650
psychedelic advocates like help support

1121
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:30,879
people who are trying to legalize

1122
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:33,130
opiates because you know these

1123
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,599
substances that are so stigmatized no

1124
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,818
one is gonna want to talk about and

1125
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:38,739
instead of when they are speaking about

1126
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:40,478
it they have to focus on reducing the

1127
00:53:38,739 --> 00:53:42,369
harms of things like it's so dangerous

1128
00:53:40,478 --> 00:53:44,348
we need to make this legal but how can

1129
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:45,940
psychedelic advocates be like well

1130
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:47,710
actually there are so many substances

1131
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,479
that are really know for the betterment

1132
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:51,759
of well people that are safe that are

1133
00:53:49,478 --> 00:53:55,568
kind of fill out this spectrum so that's

1134
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:57,849
or like my strategic priorities would

1135
00:53:55,568 --> 00:54:00,849
lie but I know that it's certainly like

1136
00:53:57,849 --> 00:54:02,769
having more support and awareness and

1137
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:04,390
just like there's so many people so

1138
00:54:02,768 --> 00:54:06,189
excited about it so I feel like there's

1139
00:54:04,389 --> 00:54:08,048
something missing by not like taking

1140
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,759
advantage of everyone being like we want

1141
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:12,460
to legalize psychedelics and move this

1142
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:14,048
forward so I think it would be cool for

1143
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:16,630
that group to really think about how to

1144
00:54:14,048 --> 00:54:18,338
organize this community of people that

1145
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,380
really want to make change and like to

1146
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:23,108
think what are the biggest pain points

1147
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,880
right now and what to focus on and right

1148
00:54:23,108 --> 00:54:26,498
now for those of you who don't know

1149
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,900
there are a network of psychedelic

1150
00:54:26,498 --> 00:54:31,538
societies across the u.s. I know Murray

1151
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,099
says audience is healthy does a lot of

1152
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:35,319
coordination and working with a lot of

1153
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:36,489
them so they're like groups that are

1154
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:39,670
kind of built in there's kind of like

1155
00:54:36,489 --> 00:54:41,289
normal equivalent that our chapters

1156
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:43,329
literally over 90 around the whole world

1157
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:44,650
and they would probably be built in

1158
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:46,930
they're the ones reaching out and

1159
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:48,400
starting these psilocybin initiatives so

1160
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:50,798
they're kind of already are those

1161
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:54,309
frameworks so I would like connect in

1162
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:56,409
with that the drug policy Alliance is a

1163
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:58,469
really great organization because

1164
00:54:56,409 --> 00:55:02,139
they're really fighting for the

1165
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:04,059
decriminalization of all drugs so yeah

1166
00:55:02,139 --> 00:55:07,598
they're awesome and I would like to

1167
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:08,890
offer I guess a concurring perspective

1168
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,140
you know I think it's good to have

1169
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,920
change on all levels at all times it's

1170
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:14,379
not a cereal

1171
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,210
it's a parallel thing and so it would be

1172
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,789
good for there to be activists pushing

1173
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:21,720
actively to repeal psychedelic

1174
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:24,429
prohibition in addition to repealing all

1175
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:25,959
prohibition but you know it's not gonna

1176
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:27,429
happen if people aren't pushing for it

1177
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,349
and it needs to be part of the

1178
00:55:27,429 --> 00:55:45,069
conversation so if you want to take the

1179
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:46,569
lead on that then you will be my hero my

1180
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:48,280
question is very similar to the last

1181
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:50,530
question actually so I guess I'll just

1182
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,600
go a little further with that because I

1183
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:54,310
was just wondering since there has been

1184
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:56,230
a lot of information about a lot of

1185
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:58,299
psychedelics for a long time like LSD

1186
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:00,940
for example it's people saying that it's

1187
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:04,090
not harmful like Timothy Leary and in

1188
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:08,019
the way the US government like made this

1189
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:10,269
guy into a criminal there's still a lot

1190
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:11,889
of of the other side of people trying to

1191
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:15,039
make them illegal and pushing for that

1192
00:56:11,889 --> 00:56:17,379
and is that a big hurdle or do you feel

1193
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,420
that psychedelics will be more legal

1194
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:23,110
soon how do you guys feel about this

1195
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:24,820
situation and currently I think that's a

1196
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,490
good question and something that I think

1197
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,740
is part of the maps strategy from you

1198
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:31,899
know over 30 years was how do we use

1199
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:35,049
this like scientific research to kind of

1200
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:37,809
prevent anyone from saying this is crazy

1201
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:39,850
and dismissing Timothy Leary and you

1202
00:56:37,809 --> 00:56:42,340
know there was tons of research before

1203
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:45,039
but it wasn't in the FDA framework that

1204
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,750
it is now so it's getting a lot harder

1205
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,059
and even in the five years I've worked

1206
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:51,869
at maps I've seen a lot less resistance

1207
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:54,849
and also Maps is we work a lot with

1208
00:56:51,869 --> 00:56:58,299
veterans and PTSD and I feel like that's

1209
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:59,349
also a particularly a population that

1210
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,700
when they're speaking about their

1211
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:03,099
experience it's really hard for people

1212
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:05,710
to just you know dismiss what they're

1213
00:57:03,099 --> 00:57:07,509
saying and and we're having people like

1214
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:11,139
Michael Pollan and all these kind of

1215
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:12,760
more mainstream and sources talking

1216
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:14,650
about you know not we're in LA how many

1217
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,440
more TV shows now do you see ayahuasca

1218
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:19,329
mentioned an MGM a therapy session or

1219
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,579
whatever it is so I think that's really

1220
00:57:19,329 --> 00:57:23,308
shifting it

1221
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:25,229
and right now I my like great I think

1222
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:27,239
the people that are don't want

1223
00:57:25,228 --> 00:57:28,938
psychedelics to be medicine and be legal

1224
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,469
are probably those who are making

1225
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:33,239
pharmaceuticals that got to take every

1226
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:35,369
single day for the rest of your life and

1227
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:37,318
something's coming along that could

1228
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,579
totally change that and those are

1229
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:41,038
already the groups trying to prevent

1230
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:42,929
cannabis from moving forward so I think

1231
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,789
it's more along those lines even though

1232
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:47,219
of course people still have you know

1233
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:49,049
don't not everyone knows about this new

1234
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:51,358
psychedelic Renaissance so there's

1235
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:54,208
probably a lot of that left over but I'm

1236
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:56,219
not I'm not seeing it like in DC then so

1237
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:58,078
many Republican legislators I meet with

1238
00:57:56,219 --> 00:58:03,358
know all about the MDMA for PTSD

1239
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:07,739
research so yeah just my my feeling of

1240
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:11,400
it and made just be my opinion nothing

1241
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:15,150
more is that the whatever the source was

1242
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:17,489
of all of that fear and you know fear

1243
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:23,568
tactics of it like the whoever was

1244
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:26,789
benefiting from that initial like Nixon

1245
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:29,159
you know like the the source of that

1246
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:34,049
paranoia and fear is kind of aged out

1247
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:36,028
and and there are a lot of consequences

1248
00:58:34,048 --> 00:58:38,400
that are leading to bigger problems like

1249
00:58:36,028 --> 00:58:40,318
with you know prison overpopulation and

1250
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,829
stuff there are a lot of like sensible

1251
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:46,739
things now that I think can relate to

1252
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:50,489
most people I don't I haven't at this

1253
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:54,449
point felt any like true conspiratorial

1254
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:57,150
hand somewhere just more like laziness

1255
00:58:54,449 --> 00:59:00,329
of like not you know it takes a lot of

1256
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:02,400
work to like pass a law to unpassed one

1257
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:04,339
takes like ten more ten times more

1258
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,910
energy it's like ridiculous

1259
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:08,849
bureaucracies are crazy

1260
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:10,678
I think psychedelics are becoming

1261
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:13,170
increasingly more accepted in society

1262
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:14,639
and especially with the advent of micro

1263
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:17,608
dosing they're going to become

1264
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:19,288
infinitely more accepted especially with

1265
00:59:17,608 --> 00:59:20,848
all the boomers who are now nearing

1266
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:23,039
retirement and they're looking for a way

1267
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:26,489
to spruce up their retirement and

1268
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:28,410
brighten their day I think and also with

1269
00:59:26,489 --> 00:59:30,358
minimal enforcement of the LSD

1270
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:32,219
prohibition by the DEA I think we're

1271
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,809
gonna see widespread use of micro dosing

1272
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:35,119
and

1273
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:39,920
even more acceptance you can only bear

1274
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:42,949
the truth for so long my questions about

1275
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:46,490
legalization as well I'm a person who

1276
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:47,629
used to be like super anti drug war and

1277
00:59:46,489 --> 00:59:50,059
thought all drugs should be legalized

1278
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:51,890
but then you hear anecdotes I was

1279
00:59:50,059 --> 00:59:54,380
talking to a woman who's rural town

1280
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:56,629
because of the opioid epidemic this is

1281
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,400
her citation it's like people you know

1282
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:00,590
steal everything like you can't have a

1283
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,720
store with like lawn furniture out front

1284
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:04,430
because it gets taken and obviously it's

1285
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:06,500
like tough to be an addict like that and

1286
01:00:04,429 --> 01:00:09,109
there's like social consequences how

1287
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:13,429
would you respond to comments about you

1288
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:14,750
know widespread drug legalization you

1289
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:16,429
know affording more opportunity for

1290
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:18,349
people to get addicted in like really

1291
01:00:16,429 --> 01:00:20,889
bad ways and then the social impacts

1292
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:20,889
that come from that

1293
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:29,599
I didn't maybe speak enough about that

1294
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:33,440
and actually in countries like Portugal

1295
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:35,690
was one country that decriminalize drugs

1296
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,909
when they were experiencing a really bad

1297
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:39,230
opiate crisis and actually what they

1298
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:42,109
found it might sound counterintuitive

1299
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:43,490
but actually decriminalizing substances

1300
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:47,180
doesn't increase use it actually

1301
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:49,119
decreases use and also decreases rates

1302
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:52,279
of contracting different illnesses

1303
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,349
decreases rates of overdoses and the

1304
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,120
theory is basically that instead of

1305
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:58,369
people having to like shoot up on a

1306
01:00:56,119 --> 01:01:00,980
street or in a bathroom and overdose

1307
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:03,170
alone and have a dirty needle and and

1308
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:05,900
not know what's in there substances when

1309
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:08,000
they can go and feel safe to seek

1310
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:10,280
treatment or seek any kind of support

1311
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,769
even if it's not to stop using even if

1312
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,930
it's to go to a safe injection space

1313
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:17,750
where you can have a clean needle you

1314
01:01:14,929 --> 01:01:19,730
could have a nurse there and you could

1315
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:21,260
have access to resources maybe you need

1316
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:23,030
help getting a job you're not ready to

1317
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,140
stop using yet but you want help with

1318
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:26,150
one thing or another

1319
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:28,339
and there the research really abundant

1320
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:31,309
it makes abundantly clear that that is

1321
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:33,380
the way to actually decrease use and to

1322
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:35,570
make use more safe and in all the

1323
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:37,309
countries that their opiates remain

1324
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:39,010
illegal and have more punitive laws

1325
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:42,820
they're actually higher rates of

1326
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:45,990
overdoses and dangerous interactions so

1327
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:48,088
yeah I guess I would look at both there

1328
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:50,819
Portugal the Czech Republic has been

1329
01:01:48,088 --> 01:01:54,380
decriminalized Spain like countries that

1330
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:57,330
have that going on and how their opiate

1331
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:59,250
context says is different than ours and

1332
01:01:57,329 --> 01:02:01,199
it's it's we're kind of shifting its

1333
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:03,570
instead of treating drug use as a

1334
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,819
criminal justice issue it's treating as

1335
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:07,980
a health issue so when you you've

1336
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:11,039
distinct eyes dit people that do

1337
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:13,260
actually want help can get help and

1338
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,900
you're going to be giving them to you

1339
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:20,160
know a social worker rather than a

1340
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:32,070
prison guard right yeah that's exactly

1341
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:35,098
right and I would just add that it is

1342
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:37,830
important you know not to overlook the

1343
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:39,750
you know they're not harmless a lot of

1344
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:43,619
them are extremely dangerous

1345
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:45,869
I think drugs in general are just like

1346
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:50,099
any other tool that we have discovered

1347
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:52,740
as a species you know we can use this

1348
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:54,900
mic stand as a mic stand or we could use

1349
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:58,399
it to bludgeon somebody with depending

1350
01:02:54,900 --> 01:03:02,550
on our intention with it right like so

1351
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,150
drugs have effects I think I couldn't

1352
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:06,900
agree more

1353
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:08,639
that's exactly right that this this is a

1354
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:13,309
health care these are health care issues

1355
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:16,949
like addiction the health consequences

1356
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:19,980
psychosis induced by sight psychedelics

1357
01:03:16,949 --> 01:03:22,230
psychosis induced by cocaine math those

1358
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:24,539
are all medical issues let the medical

1359
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:26,280
community work with it support the

1360
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:30,300
medical community in dealing with it

1361
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:32,880
treat addicts as patients I think when

1362
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:34,740
you make it a criminal justice thing you

1363
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,800
just add one more of those bad

1364
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:40,469
consequences now they're disenfranchised

1365
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,490
citizens now they can't vote now they

1366
01:03:40,469 --> 01:03:46,588
can't get jobs

1367
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:48,389
it's like much faster to steal and you

1368
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:51,059
know do all those bad things when you

1369
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:57,239
have no prospects - you know I've been

1370
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:58,949
told you're you're a fuckup when you

1371
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:59,669
look at some of the work by cab or Ma

1372
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:01,649
Tei who

1373
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:03,240
looks at addiction and what the root

1374
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:07,200
causes of addiction are you see it's

1375
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:09,299
often trauma and so if people can get

1376
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,829
help with their trauma then and you can

1377
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,350
give them better coping skills then

1378
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:27,480
maybe they don't need to use drugs to

1379
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:29,610
cope so it's not we like to it's a lot

1380
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:32,460
easier for us to vilify the drug but

1381
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:34,410
it's really not like the drug is the way

1382
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:37,170
of treating the trauma

1383
01:04:34,409 --> 01:04:38,670
I think our stigmatizing a substance

1384
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:41,280
kind of makes it more appealing it

1385
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,599
becomes a forbidden fruit you know want

1386
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,519
to see substances are no longer

1387
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:46,230
forbidden once they're seen for what

1388
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:48,929
they are something that is usually

1389
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:50,909
harmful to the user then they don't have

1390
01:04:48,929 --> 01:04:54,029
that appeal of you know doing something

1391
01:04:50,909 --> 01:04:57,210
that is out long thank you that's really

1392
01:04:54,030 --> 01:05:00,960
awesome information thank you

1393
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:02,460
in terms of micro dosing like I wanted

1394
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,519
you guys to maybe address it from like

1395
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:07,110
the everyday life of sort of like I

1396
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,840
don't know like professionals and like

1397
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:12,690
or people it's just everyday the

1398
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:16,579
everyday person right but also like

1399
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:20,579
micro dosing in terms of like LSD versus

1400
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:22,889
MDMA and like how those two there are

1401
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:25,139
very different drugs but you know I mean

1402
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:29,009
we can't encourage people to do illegal

1403
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:31,289
substances so you know but there are

1404
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:35,220
good resources online there's a website

1405
01:05:31,289 --> 01:05:38,579
called the third wave that helps people

1406
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:39,539
be safe in their use from I would say a

1407
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:41,849
little bit more of a harm reduction

1408
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:43,800
perspective so I think there would be a

1409
01:05:41,849 --> 01:05:48,739
great resource for for learning more

1410
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:51,780
about that I'm not as familiar with it I

1411
01:05:48,739 --> 01:05:54,169
think James Fadiman who has been around

1412
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:56,830
for a long time and did a pretty serious

1413
01:05:54,170 --> 01:06:00,070
dissection

1414
01:05:56,829 --> 01:06:02,980
of the topic though James Fadiman be

1415
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:05,350
somebody to look for I think you

1416
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:08,139
recently published a book and a lot of

1417
01:06:05,349 --> 01:06:10,089
like the I started hearing about a whole

1418
01:06:08,139 --> 01:06:16,480
lot more after after that book came out

1419
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:20,050
so encourage people micro dosing to fill

1420
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,630
out a survey and that's what he talks a

1421
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:24,280
lot about but I'm curious you mentioned

1422
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:26,050
MDMA micro dosing and I'm curious like

1423
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:33,970
from you guys if you've heard of that

1424
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:38,670
good speaking of you know negative you

1425
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:44,949
know that it's not all fun and games the

1426
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:48,420
MDMA there's a there's a effect called

1427
01:06:44,949 --> 01:06:50,589
chronic tolerance that some people are

1428
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:54,070
potentially everyone would get after

1429
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:59,710
enough doses of MDMA where it no longer

1430
01:06:54,070 --> 01:07:03,220
works so microdose you know regularly I

1431
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:05,170
think would just expedite that and if

1432
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:08,039
it's a tool that would be really

1433
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:10,840
beneficial and helpful and a you know

1434
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:12,969
down the line after a traumatic event I

1435
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:16,059
mean life's full of traumas and nobody

1436
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:17,409
can be guaranteed not to have one it'd

1437
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:20,769
be good to have that tool still in their

1438
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:23,199
toolbox and it's not oh go ahead it's

1439
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:24,219
it's it's also I mean MDMA is a little

1440
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:27,279
bit different than some of the other

1441
01:07:24,219 --> 01:07:30,389
psychedelics it doesn't I mean a LSD and

1442
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:34,090
psilocybin have shown to have kind of

1443
01:07:30,389 --> 01:07:36,190
neurological benefits or creativity

1444
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:39,789
benefits words when we did our dosed

1445
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:41,769
responsive studies in further maps they

1446
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:45,369
were showing that actually lower doses

1447
01:07:41,769 --> 01:07:48,159
of MDMA they were still not microdose

1448
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:50,019
but actually made people more anxious

1449
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:52,599
and had they had worse outcomes at lower

1450
01:07:50,019 --> 01:07:55,449
doses of MDMA because what you're doing

1451
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:58,409
is MDMA is it's a it's a it's related to

1452
01:07:55,449 --> 01:08:01,480
amphetamines so you're getting all the

1453
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:04,719
jittery fetta mean a part of the the

1454
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:09,190
MDMA without getting the the serotonin

1455
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:10,118
and dopamine and oxytocin flood with it

1456
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:12,068
so you're not getting the

1457
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:16,119
benefits you're just getting the the

1458
01:08:12,068 --> 01:08:19,329
anxiety part and the the health their

1459
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:21,608
MDMA is not a good one to do very often

1460
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:24,600
because it does tax your system it's

1461
01:08:21,609 --> 01:08:28,770
it's not like the other ones a bias plug

1462
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:32,859
maps though is been carrying the torch

1463
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:37,989
like they have been around for thirty

1464
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:44,219
years earlier there was a the comment

1465
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:46,838
about you know DMT you know that though

1466
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:49,149
when I was hearing was some frustration

1467
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:51,789
that we will only study things if

1468
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:54,039
there's may be a medical benefit because

1469
01:08:51,789 --> 01:08:57,189
of maps we don't we even only have that

1470
01:08:54,039 --> 01:09:01,658
like no one was funding this stuff yeah

1471
01:08:57,189 --> 01:09:04,658
maps like raised the money by donations

1472
01:09:01,658 --> 01:09:07,629
from rooms like this with awesome people

1473
01:09:04,658 --> 01:09:10,179
and the effort of more and and a

1474
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:13,659
snowballing process of funding and

1475
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:16,359
research and we're right at the finish

1476
01:09:13,658 --> 01:09:19,210
line there are lots of groups and

1477
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:20,949
organizations out there but maps really

1478
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:23,170
deserves I think that recognition and

1479
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:24,939
credit and we're just trying to get past

1480
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:27,850
the finish line here you know because

1481
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:29,738
once we reschedule then we're gonna get

1482
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:31,659
so much more ability to get research

1483
01:09:29,738 --> 01:09:34,000
money and then all of these studies that

1484
01:09:31,658 --> 01:09:35,318
people are interested in we can start

1485
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,079
doing them because there's gonna be

1486
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:40,810
money so it's like focusing all the

1487
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:43,420
money on to get this across this finish

1488
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:46,359
line and then it's gonna really open up

1489
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:49,298
right like I can't I couldn't try to get

1490
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:51,310
a a grant for a federal loan which is

1491
01:09:49,298 --> 01:09:53,889
where the majority of research comes

1492
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:56,620
from unless you are a drug company or

1493
01:09:53,889 --> 01:10:00,010
being funded by a drug company to do

1494
01:09:56,619 --> 01:10:01,809
their research the National Institute of

1495
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:03,670
Mental Health and the National Institute

1496
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:05,620
of drug abuse combined I think is over

1497
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:08,859
almost three billion dollars in funding

1498
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:10,840
this study is thirty to forty million

1499
01:10:08,859 --> 01:10:14,170
something last fall park estimate I

1500
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:17,529
heard like that kind of that kind of

1501
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:19,060
grant you know is not very hard to get

1502
01:10:17,529 --> 01:10:20,899
for something something this

1503
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:24,110
groundbreaking like the

1504
01:10:20,899 --> 01:10:28,639
if the there would be plenty of funding

1505
01:10:24,109 --> 01:10:30,198
but but you can't propose a study of

1506
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,510
something that's directly against the

1507
01:10:30,198 --> 01:10:34,039
policy of you know the neighboring

1508
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:36,730
department or sometimes the same

1509
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:40,219
Department in the government agency so

1510
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:44,959
once it's rescheduled those proposals

1511
01:10:40,219 --> 01:10:49,119
can be taken seriously and yeah I mean

1512
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,119
then the Renaissance will really begin

1513
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:57,319
yeah I don't know if this is a question

1514
01:10:55,310 --> 01:11:00,230
that might be better for like after the

1515
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:02,299
panel or something I could do online but

1516
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:04,639
I work at a place it's actually called

1517
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:08,630
the psychedelic healing Shack and it's

1518
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,280
in Detroit Michigan and I was just

1519
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:13,310
wondering if there were any like

1520
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:15,769
chapters or representatives of maps in

1521
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:17,480
Michigan or in Detroit because we would

1522
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:25,730
love to like have an event or like you

1523
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:29,299
did a discussion at our venue there's

1524
01:11:25,729 --> 01:11:32,299
mine manifest Midwest but that's coin in

1525
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:36,440
Detroit not in Detroit yeah you should

1526
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:41,150
start your own psychedelic Society talk

1527
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:43,819
to Marissa where do you see the or is

1528
01:11:41,149 --> 01:11:46,039
there a relationship between the work

1529
01:11:43,819 --> 01:11:51,559
that you're doing current currently and

1530
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:53,569
the unregulated guided psychedelic I

1531
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,850
don't know what what exactly that you

1532
01:11:53,569 --> 01:11:57,588
know to call to call that right now that

1533
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:59,629
is

1534
01:11:57,588 --> 01:12:01,878
yeah you know I think that's what like

1535
01:11:59,628 --> 01:12:03,529
Michael Pollan was speaking to a lot in

1536
01:12:01,878 --> 01:12:05,809
his book and I mean I see that right now

1537
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:07,639
is like oh man would I love my parents

1538
01:12:05,809 --> 01:12:10,219
to have some sort of guided experience

1539
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:12,649
to help them transition in an

1540
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:14,479
appropriate way but it makes me a little

1541
01:12:12,649 --> 01:12:16,459
bit nervous just you know look up

1542
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:18,679
someone out of the you know blue or even

1543
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:22,248
on a recommendation because it's you

1544
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:23,449
know dealing with 65 and 67 year olds is

1545
01:12:22,248 --> 01:12:25,760
maybe different than I would experiment

1546
01:12:23,448 --> 01:12:31,038
on myself or surely the 20 year old

1547
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:32,479
version of myself would have done feel

1548
01:12:31,038 --> 01:12:36,648
that people that are doing this work

1549
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:39,349
like bravely at risk of incarceration

1550
01:12:36,649 --> 01:12:41,989
are really important to what we're doing

1551
01:12:39,349 --> 01:12:43,668
and you know it started you know before

1552
01:12:41,988 --> 01:12:45,078
I was illegal in the 70s there were

1553
01:12:43,668 --> 01:12:47,748
these therapists and these frameworks

1554
01:12:45,078 --> 01:12:49,578
and then when it got made illegal a lot

1555
01:12:47,748 --> 01:12:51,128
of these therapists kept working in

1556
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:56,268
different contexts and they've kind of

1557
01:12:51,128 --> 01:12:59,358
maintained this protocol and modality

1558
01:12:56,269 --> 01:13:01,550
and way of doing therapy and you know

1559
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:03,979
we're very careful and art you know our

1560
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:06,199
work is all very separate because we

1561
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:07,999
have to be used to do this FDA research

1562
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:10,038
but we're definitely I'm really grateful

1563
01:13:07,998 --> 01:13:11,658
to work at maps because we're not one to

1564
01:13:10,038 --> 01:13:13,309
be like we're nothing like that you know

1565
01:13:11,658 --> 01:13:14,748
we're like really appreciate the work

1566
01:13:13,309 --> 01:13:16,788
that they're doing and right now we

1567
01:13:14,748 --> 01:13:19,608
can't give access to people the way we

1568
01:13:16,788 --> 01:13:21,018
want to and so if people can get

1569
01:13:19,609 --> 01:13:22,819
something that's gonna literally save

1570
01:13:21,019 --> 01:13:25,399
their life or make their ease their

1571
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:27,739
transition like we're you know I think

1572
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:30,139
that's wonderful and there's also a lot

1573
01:13:27,738 --> 01:13:31,518
happening legally outside of the US so

1574
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:33,889
that's something really worth

1575
01:13:31,519 --> 01:13:36,019
investigating and then there's like

1576
01:13:33,889 --> 01:13:38,208
ketamine that's legal in the US so

1577
01:13:36,019 --> 01:13:40,519
there's really lots of levels but you

1578
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:42,378
know I know I recently moved to LA and

1579
01:13:40,519 --> 01:13:44,659
there's definitely lots of communities

1580
01:13:42,378 --> 01:13:46,878
around here and I think that's really

1581
01:13:44,658 --> 01:13:48,108
for me like that's really important

1582
01:13:46,878 --> 01:13:49,878
because that's part of what's giving

1583
01:13:48,109 --> 01:13:52,429
people access and experience and

1584
01:13:49,878 --> 01:13:55,639
learning about how these laws are messed

1585
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:57,078
up and also mcc's perience Healing

1586
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:59,328
changes that hopefully are going to

1587
01:13:57,078 --> 01:14:02,568
impact our whole world and and I think

1588
01:13:59,328 --> 01:14:04,368
that we have to just I guess are focused

1589
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:06,619
I'll just end with this as talking about

1590
01:14:04,368 --> 01:14:08,179
reducing harms right so we're know this

1591
01:14:06,618 --> 01:14:10,068
stuff is happening whether or not we

1592
01:14:08,179 --> 01:14:11,389
like it so we really believe in making

1593
01:14:10,069 --> 01:14:13,400
sure people have as much and for

1594
01:14:11,389 --> 01:14:16,190
as possible to do it as safely as

1595
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:18,170
possible so like maps puts all of our

1596
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:20,149
protocols are for how we do our study is

1597
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:22,489
online we make everything really

1598
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:25,009
available so that people can learn and

1599
01:14:22,488 --> 01:14:26,779
read up and do these things with

1600
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:29,420
intention because it does really matter

1601
01:14:26,779 --> 01:14:32,479
how you do it but you know we don't

1602
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:35,449
think we can control everything and I

1603
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:37,158
wouldn't I would add that they it's it's

1604
01:14:35,448 --> 01:14:41,178
a it's a tricky time right now because

1605
01:14:37,158 --> 01:14:44,408
this is getting more attention there are

1606
01:14:41,179 --> 01:14:47,989
many more people jumping into this field

1607
01:14:44,408 --> 01:14:50,509
with maybe not the best training or the

1608
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:51,589
best container or and when you the

1609
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:53,780
people that are working in the

1610
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:57,199
underground don't have supervision they

1611
01:14:53,779 --> 01:14:59,750
don't have people that they're figuring

1612
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:02,210
out if they're doing their best work so

1613
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:09,319
a peer review you know it's it's a

1614
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:13,510
tricky you know a space and so yeah it's

1615
01:15:09,319 --> 01:15:16,009
it's you know it is the Wild West so

1616
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:17,329
I'll do a little bit of a shameless plug

1617
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:20,600
but we've been talking about this at the

1618
01:15:17,329 --> 01:15:26,260
aware project a lot and we recently put

1619
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:30,079
together a multi-part guide that we're

1620
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:32,060
helping people make good choices when

1621
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:33,800
they start if they go down that road and

1622
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,600
are looking for someone to work with in

1623
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,060
the underground because from a harm

1624
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,409
reduction approach we need to make sure

1625
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:41,510
that people are asking the right

1626
01:15:39,408 --> 01:15:43,129
questions of themselves making sure

1627
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:44,570
they're asking the right questions to

1628
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:46,039
the people they may be sitting with and

1629
01:15:44,569 --> 01:15:48,139
also making sure that those people are

1630
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:50,779
asking you the right questions so that

1631
01:15:48,139 --> 01:15:54,079
they're they're not giving you anything

1632
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:56,090
that that could harm you so we have a

1633
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:59,710
really extensive guide on our on our

1634
01:15:56,090 --> 01:16:02,810
site so I recommend checking that out

1635
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:05,658
yeah and then the integration our

1636
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:10,310
integration program Maps has its own

1637
01:16:05,658 --> 01:16:13,158
integration program where they've have

1638
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:14,090
people from all over the the world of

1639
01:16:13,158 --> 01:16:16,279
the u.s. that

1640
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:18,440
that offer psychedelic integration

1641
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:20,779
support but it's not underground therapy

1642
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:22,579
it's just integration Innerspace

1643
01:16:20,779 --> 01:16:24,769
integration and we also do the same to

1644
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:27,050
help people prepare for an experience

1645
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:28,520
and then also integration afterwards so

1646
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:31,730
you can get really good advice from

1647
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:35,030
people there on how to kind of figure

1648
01:16:31,729 --> 01:16:37,009
out how to navigate those kinds of

1649
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:45,289
questions but obviously not to help you

1650
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:46,880
find them because some people might take

1651
01:16:45,289 --> 01:16:48,350
psychedelics on their own and then come

1652
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,000
to this therapist that can help them

1653
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,590
kind of integrate and make sense of it

1654
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,779
or some people might have had a bad

1655
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:55,880
signal experience and need a therapist

1656
01:16:53,779 --> 01:16:57,729
that understands but it's just a list

1657
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,810
that Maps has on our website of

1658
01:16:57,729 --> 01:17:01,099
therapists throughout the country in the

1659
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:03,289
world that are kind of familiar with

1660
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:07,400
these states and experiences so they can

1661
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:09,109
like support you through that I guess

1662
01:17:07,399 --> 01:17:11,869
I'll also say because I definitely was

1663
01:17:09,109 --> 01:17:14,569
forgot about the caution which is really

1664
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:17,239
important okay we're all up here there's

1665
01:17:14,569 --> 01:17:19,279
also unfortunately a lot of instances of

1666
01:17:17,239 --> 01:17:22,369
sexual assault and like ayahuasca

1667
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:24,769
communities and it's like where people

1668
01:17:22,369 --> 01:17:26,899
who you know call themselves shamans or

1669
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:29,330
sleeping with people in ceremony and

1670
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:31,519
telling them are the employees and that

1671
01:17:29,329 --> 01:17:34,010
can be deeply traumatic especially when

1672
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:36,920
people are healing their sexual traumas

1673
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:38,329
and there's just so there is a lot but

1674
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,010
it's you know things are illegal and

1675
01:17:38,329 --> 01:17:41,840
unregulated then there's a lot of

1676
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:44,440
dangerous we had someone in the

1677
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:48,500
underground ayahuasca community recently

1678
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:50,269
arrested and put in jail for sexual

1679
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:55,810
assault during an ayahuasca ceremony so

1680
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:57,790
it happens up here too yeah there's

1681
01:17:55,810 --> 01:18:00,950
there's so many

1682
01:17:57,789 --> 01:18:03,350
yes it's an underground movement and

1683
01:18:00,949 --> 01:18:06,590
it's a critical time and yet there's

1684
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:09,590
hundreds of Facebook groups that are all

1685
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:11,680
being monitored by the government there

1686
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:14,289
of every practitioner of this

1687
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:17,840
underground working it's signal or

1688
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:20,239
telegram or hidden messengers there's

1689
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:24,230
really no place safe to find out how to

1690
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:27,829
access a therapist yet there's a hundred

1691
01:18:24,229 --> 01:18:31,250
million people doing different forms of

1692
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:32,619
MDMA without any guidance and who did

1693
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:36,170
not understand the difference between

1694
01:18:32,619 --> 01:18:37,788
ceremonial medicinal and recreational it

1695
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:41,239
seems to me that

1696
01:18:37,788 --> 01:18:44,630
can start to transform the way people

1697
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:48,638
think about MDMA or Molly or ecstasy on

1698
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:52,460
mass that is possible we can bring this

1699
01:18:48,639 --> 01:18:55,639
revolution transformation faster so

1700
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:58,279
what's possible from a communication

1701
01:18:55,639 --> 01:18:59,779
medium to allow this information to

1702
01:18:58,279 --> 01:19:02,210
propagate and to find the right

1703
01:18:59,779 --> 01:19:04,460
practitioner and to make it safe for

1704
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:09,349
people to jump in the water and truly

1705
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:12,800
start healing I mean until we have a

1706
01:19:09,349 --> 01:19:14,538
legal process I mean until is legalized

1707
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,880
I mean there's not going to be a wait

1708
01:19:14,538 --> 01:19:19,908
for people to do that safely for the

1709
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,199
practitioner I mean so I mean there are

1710
01:19:19,908 --> 01:19:24,888
people that put themselves out there

1711
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:28,479
quite boldly in what they do and I think

1712
01:19:24,889 --> 01:19:30,590
a little too recklessly but you know

1713
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:32,750
that the practitioners need to be

1714
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:34,429
responsible too because if they're not

1715
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:36,019
watching their practice that could

1716
01:19:34,429 --> 01:19:39,230
really jeopardize what we're trying to

1717
01:19:36,019 --> 01:19:42,559
do in the above-ground work so I mean if

1718
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:43,759
people want this to become a medicine we

1719
01:19:42,559 --> 01:19:47,179
need to support the legalization

1720
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:49,519
movements because this is and and to

1721
01:19:47,179 --> 01:19:52,429
realize that this is a slow this is a

1722
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:54,500
slow I mean we're getting to a point

1723
01:19:52,429 --> 01:19:57,710
where we're getting some faster turning

1724
01:19:54,500 --> 01:20:02,300
points but you know this is a long game

1725
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:03,710
and and and so I mean I don't know how I

1726
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:06,920
mean the best we can do right now is

1727
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:09,679
help people find harm you know teach

1728
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:12,408
them about harm reduction from a legal

1729
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:14,328
you know from above-ground way but

1730
01:20:12,408 --> 01:20:16,759
underground communities and and people

1731
01:20:14,328 --> 01:20:19,130
that are participating in those kinds of

1732
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:21,380
communities need to watch out for one

1733
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:23,179
another and when they do bring people

1734
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:24,889
into their communities to do it in a

1735
01:20:23,179 --> 01:20:27,559
responsible way so that there's sort of

1736
01:20:24,889 --> 01:20:31,010
a buddy system and and that you're and

1737
01:20:27,559 --> 01:20:35,059
that you're supporting people in their

1738
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:37,039
integration process so you know they're

1739
01:20:35,059 --> 01:20:38,538
the and they're more and more the

1740
01:20:37,038 --> 01:20:41,238
underground communities are connecting

1741
01:20:38,538 --> 01:20:43,719
more and more so that they can watch out

1742
01:20:41,238 --> 01:20:43,718
for their own

1743
01:20:45,819 --> 01:20:51,109
yeah so there's there's a lot of good

1744
01:20:48,439 --> 01:20:52,759
recommendations for those and and more

1745
01:20:51,109 --> 01:20:55,130
the more people get connected especially

1746
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,690
you know people through a net

1747
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:59,328
psychedelic societies just talking about

1748
01:20:56,689 --> 01:21:00,919
to each other about you know smart ways

1749
01:20:59,328 --> 01:21:06,319
of going about these things I think is

1750
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:07,998
helping a lot you know like these

1751
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:10,130
problems also come up in the

1752
01:21:07,998 --> 01:21:13,698
above-ground world you know there are

1753
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:17,719
people who violate their role in

1754
01:21:13,698 --> 01:21:21,049
relationships and but the difference is

1755
01:21:17,719 --> 01:21:23,498
that there is a system for qualifying

1756
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:27,288
those people there's a system for

1757
01:21:23,498 --> 01:21:31,748
reprimanding those people taking away

1758
01:21:27,288 --> 01:21:35,809
that right to play that role anymore so

1759
01:21:31,748 --> 01:21:38,448
yeah I mean if the underground can

1760
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:41,529
create a similar sort of board

1761
01:21:38,448 --> 01:21:47,598
certification process or in my opinion

1762
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:49,189
we we bring these modalities into the

1763
01:21:47,599 --> 01:21:52,400
system that has those kinds of checks

1764
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:53,710
and balances and reporting systems and

1765
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:56,058
that's how we reach the most people

1766
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:59,989
because a lot of people aren't doing a

1767
01:21:56,059 --> 01:22:02,179
lot of people who need this help don't

1768
01:21:59,988 --> 01:22:05,928
live in Venice California you know they

1769
01:22:02,179 --> 01:22:08,210
live in like an Idaho and the Midwest

1770
01:22:05,929 --> 01:22:10,578
and wouldn't think about going to

1771
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:19,399
somebody underground you know would be

1772
01:22:10,578 --> 01:22:20,899
able to find some ayahuasca circles are

1773
01:22:19,399 --> 01:22:29,929
spreading out everywhere don't discount

1774
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:33,859
the Midwest all right any last words

1775
01:22:29,929 --> 01:22:35,719
because we got to wrap it up I would add

1776
01:22:33,859 --> 01:22:37,848
that these underground practitioners

1777
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:41,029
need to self-regulate because we're in

1778
01:22:37,849 --> 01:22:42,828
an era of very tolerant enforcement and

1779
01:22:41,029 --> 01:22:44,719
they don't want to bring down the heat

1780
01:22:42,828 --> 01:22:46,518
on everybody and ruin it for everybody

1781
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,980
and so if you're an underground

1782
01:22:46,519 --> 01:22:51,498
practitioner and you see somebody who is

1783
01:22:48,979 --> 01:22:53,709
in that same space and it's not being

1784
01:22:51,498 --> 01:22:55,939
ethical and it's not following the best

1785
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:57,239
you know practices I think it's

1786
01:22:55,939 --> 01:22:58,769
incumbent upon you

1787
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:02,130
