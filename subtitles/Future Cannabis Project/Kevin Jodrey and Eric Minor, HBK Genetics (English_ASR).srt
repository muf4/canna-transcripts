1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:15,000
[Music]

2
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:18,028
this is my pot Eric and and Eric was

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,019
someone that I had on an interview for

4
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:23,698
the first breda series because I respect

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,849
them as an individual and I respect his

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,039
work but what Eric did was Eric

7
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,859
transferred over to topicals

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,710
because his ability to get a license was

9
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,600
hampered because nursery licenses to

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,700
function as a breeder require a nursery

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,308
license to sell and that means you have

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,870
to have commercial real estate and so

13
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,439
commercial real estate is expensive and

14
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,699
so for the majority people that I know

15
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,799
they don't have the ability to really

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,399
have all the tools and so aren't shifts

17
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,530
over to topicals but lo and behold one

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,308
of his flagship creations wins the

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,109
Emerald cup and I said oh my gosh I said

20
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:04,558
you're still a breeder in who you are

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,599
and you're still alive in cannabis

22
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,099
because you just made an adjustment to

23
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,500
where you were gonna go forward with

24
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,319
what you did but I said but I would love

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,329
to have you come up and you know and be

26
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,599
introduced because you're somebody who

27
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:21,629
created a variety that won a major

28
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,969
competition and allowed the people who

29
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:26,670
grew it to have cell ability because

30
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,759
these these wins give you publicity and

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,799
then it creates a demand and I just said

32
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,920
man even though you're not breeding in

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,829
the normal sense anymore your creations

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,618
are resonating and he also had done work

35
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:42,658
prior that he didn't get credit for that

36
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,819
I had done huge movements of the

37
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,399
material and he gets a hold of me one

38
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,109
day and he said hey on the galaxy my

39
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,700
material in your material are the same

40
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,500
material and I don't understand how that

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,049
can be and I said oh it's easy

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,269
somebody fucked you and I got ahold of

43
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,409
it and you never got credit so what

44
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:00,420
we're gonna do is we're gonna give you

45
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,740
credit for the material you did because

46
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,730
otherwise what happens is you get

47
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:07,640
diminished so

48
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:10,170
[Applause]

49
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,300
so so definitely not a one-hit wonder

50
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,979
someone who's been in business a long

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,110
time who has done a lot of good breeding

52
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,269
work who's developed a lot of varieties

53
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,560
the the we called the green ribbon but

54
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,050
it was the hottest variety in the

55
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,699
Sacramento cannabis market so before

56
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,070
they wiped out the Sacramento cannabis

57
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:28,349
market it was booming the variety that

58
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,329
he created was one of the hottest

59
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,189
variety is one of the hardest clones to

60
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,610
get your hands on because it was hoarded

61
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:37,859
and when I realized that he had done

62
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,470
this I said my gosh I said you need to

63
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,610
be able to bring this out and so my

64
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:43,379
whole thing with a lot of the interviews

65
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,020
is I just give you a chance to talk and

66
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,460
then I'll ask some questions and we open

67
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,469
it up to the audience quick because

68
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,330
you're gonna want to ask people these

69
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,609
questions of like what direction are you

70
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,710
moving what what motivated you to do

71
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,540
this what was the source material you

72
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,879
used where do you see the industry

73
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,530
moving because these are the information

74
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,139
that you need because you're not gonna

75
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,539
get this from anybody nobody in the

76
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,208
mainship everybody makes you sign and

77
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,709
these you can talk to him now and so the

78
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,170
thing is all the information that's

79
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,939
being generated is being preserved and

80
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,219
held for a very specific group of people

81
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,430
just like economics economics was a

82
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,650
study paid for and funded by the wealthy

83
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,020
to understand how do they remain wealthy

84
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,489
and why do you not get economics

85
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,010
education in school because they don't

86
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,539
want you to be wealthy and so to me this

87
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,069
is the same information as you get an

88
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:34,409
opportunity to talk to some sharp people

89
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:42,840
and I'm gonna get off the mic and give

90
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:46,259
it there everybody hear me hello my name

91
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:52,560
is Eric miner I own HBK I'm second

92
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:54,899
generation a farmer yeah so yeah I'm

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,699
second generation my father grew when I

94
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,920
was really little and then I kind of

95
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,839
picked it up in high school I'm so Cal

96
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,119
so I don't really have a lot of ties to

97
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,640
hobble area except for the last few

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,489
years as I've been progressing to get up

99
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,259
into this area I had a lot of success

100
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:14,009
with my topicals I started making

101
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:16,168
topicals in the mid 90s my daughter was

102
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:18,120
born with a rare skin condition so

103
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:21,478
I was one of the few that were actually

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,939
making topicals for people before there

105
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,228
was excess material to just say hey what

106
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,240
the hell are we gonna do with all this

107
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:30,750
material that's dump it into a topical

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,639
brand and try to move it so there were a

109
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,579
need for what I was doing at that time

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,620
and when I first started breeding in the

111
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:40,560
early 90s there were no seed banks

112
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,158
available to Cuzco you know order seeds

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,379
if you needed seeds you had to source it

114
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:49,259
from somebody else and then create your

115
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:52,050
own seats you just didn't go by big lots

116
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,658
of seeds to then you know oh I want this

117
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,000
drain I'm gonna go source it out so for

118
00:04:54,658 --> 00:05:00,389
me um breeding was a necessity in the

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,418
beginning and that kind of just led into

120
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:06,269
me getting the strains out there but

121
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:07,859
realistically like the reason I got kind

122
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:10,709
of screwed on some of my strains was

123
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,360
being an older breeder we didn't tell

124
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:14,668
people what we were doing we stayed very

125
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,550
quiet we only dealt with certain people

126
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:20,370
and only ones that were trusted so and

127
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,259
even into the mid 2000 range I was still

128
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,079
being very quiet about what I was doing

129
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,330
and a lot of strains got out because I

130
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:31,258
wanted those strains to get out to to

131
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:33,838
the farmers that needed them but as some

132
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,908
people do they didn't you know be

133
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:37,139
forthcoming with that and made an

134
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:39,990
advantage for themselves

135
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,908
which ultimately brought me here because

136
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:46,650
as we all know things come full circle

137
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:50,209
you know and so this year my chili

138
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:50,209
birdie hit baking at the Emerald cup

139
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,160
[Applause]

140
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,689
thank you and so yeah that was a strain

141
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,910
that actually came full circle when I

142
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:01,709
released that in 2014 at the emerald-cut

143
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,680
I kind of took a beating on that string

144
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:07,289
at the time those strains the lavender

145
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,550
was played out pretty heavily nobody was

146
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,189
really interested in working with it

147
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,829
then because they had driven it into the

148
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:16,079
ground and the key lime pie was taking

149
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:18,689
kind of not that great of reception

150
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,219
because it was the the cut of cookies

151
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:22,589
that nobody really wanted to mess with

152
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,120
and after I had done the work with it I

153
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,199
was like wow this is something that

154
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,870
really needs to get out to the public

155
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,459
and I tried to kick and stomp and tell

156
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,430
people when nobody really listened and

157
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:34,709
then when I met Kevin for the seat

158
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,110
series a few years back I brought it cut

159
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,459
up and I was like hey you know this this

160
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,430
is something you guys really need to

161
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:44,370
check out and it took another two years

162
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,590
and realistically as a breeder it's not

163
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,329
just you breeding something amazing and

164
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:51,359
saying hey this is what I've got it

165
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:54,539
takes a community of people to get that

166
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,340
out there to the public it wasn't it

167
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,700
took several people with big social

168
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,739
media accounts and and being able to get

169
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,379
that strain out to customers who then

170
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,230
told everybody hey you know this is this

171
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:09,149
is amazing and then it created a buzz

172
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,560
about that strain and that's something

173
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:12,689
you kind of want to work with when

174
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,259
you're working with your strains is make

175
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:17,699
sure you have something that you can get

176
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,349
out to the public and that public's then

177
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,969
gonna tell everybody hey you know this

178
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,750
was amazing we want to work with this

179
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:29,870
and that will then come back to you and

180
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:32,370
and hopefully make your product more

181
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,370
accessible and want people want that

182
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,170
want it the other thing is as a breeder

183
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,149
you have to find your niche what are you

184
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,759
doing are you creating a commercial

185
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:43,049
brand that other farmers will then make

186
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,959
a lot of money off of are you doing

187
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,920
extract work are you doing heirloom

188
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:51,359
preservation and a lot of that is

189
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,129
acclamation to what you're doing so some

190
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,600
people are don't have the ability to do

191
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:56,430
heirloom preservation because some of

192
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,210
those strains just don't work in your

193
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,470
area and then with that so you kind of

194
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,269
have to find your niche who are you

195
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,490
working with who are you selling to if

196
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:06,299
you're doing extraction work you know

197
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,590
your

198
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,689
you gotta find the ones that the

199
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:11,639
extractors are wanting and it's really

200
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,110
listicle ii a two-year process of being

201
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,939
able to get those strains out there

202
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,530
because the first year you're creating

203
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,360
those strains then you're doing R&amp;D

204
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,279
research with those strains to make sure

205
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,889
they're even going to be acceptable and

206
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,019
work with the people that are using them

207
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,789
so you have strains that you create you

208
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,109
think oh wow this is something that's

209
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,520
got to be out there to the market but

210
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,740
then you get it into commercial

211
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,470
production and it doesn't transfer over

212
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,409
well into the market because it's either

213
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,509
fluffy and the public is like God you

214
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,939
know that's not what I wanted or the

215
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:44,129
terpene profile isn't currently what's

216
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,160
up to par with what everybody's looking

217
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:49,320
for at that time so realistically two

218
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,120
years prior you need to be thinking

219
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,000
about well what what am I going to

220
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,610
create that people are going to want two

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,169
years from now because as a breeder

222
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,509
you're not just gonna make something

223
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:03,059
right off the bat dump it on the market

224
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:06,149
and everybody's going to get it not very

225
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:09,569
many people have that accessibility to

226
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,799
the general population to below their

227
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,090
strains up unless you have a

228
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:17,419
multi-million dollar account with

229
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:20,940
advertisers and social media so as a

230
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:22,799
small based farm you really have to talk

231
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,630
to your customers talk to the people

232
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,849
that you're working with say hey what

233
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:29,399
are you hearing from your people what do

234
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:33,000
they want is it fruits is it is it oh

235
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,490
geez is it gases as autos and then from

236
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,529
there start to create your plan of what

237
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,590
you want to create and get out to the

238
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:41,879
market what was this what you start with

239
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,080
in the 90s what was your what was your

240
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,620
beginning source material for your

241
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,389
topicals dah that was from Jamie I

242
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:53,820
started working with Jamie at resin

243
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:56,850
seats through advice through Ringo he we

244
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,879
talked about CBD production and um

245
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:06,990
figuring out whether those would be more

246
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:08,789
applicable to topical creams and once I

247
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,659
started experimenting with that a little

248
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:14,849
bit we started realizing that CBD was

249
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:16,679
really what was where the topical

250
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,940
applications were I've been making Tata

251
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,889
THC only trains for a while

252
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,320
but I wasn't really getting the results

253
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,029
that I really wanted and then once we

254
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,090
started doing work with Ringo strains

255
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:30,819
and then what Jamie from resin we really

256
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,980
started to see a big boost in that but

257
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,700
now the CBD market has really started to

258
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,500
change if you are thinking about getting

259
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,290
in the CBD game you have to really think

260
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,769
about the new ham production and how big

261
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:47,679
that is and what they will entail and if

262
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,269
you are a small farm you might want to

263
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,829
seriously think about one to ones that

264
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:55,600
are even based because that is so that

265
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,860
will get you a little bit farther in the

266
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,420
game because you're not competing

267
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,090
against multi-million dollar ham

268
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:02,919
productions well the the thing that with

269
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,200
with the with the new have laws FDA

270
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:08,409
takes on him and under the under the

271
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,000
farms and with hemp production you can

272
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:12,579
make it into a product called we call it

273
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,320
no backhoe so it's not tobacco but you

274
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,570
smoke it like it's tobacco and you can

275
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,150
use it as topicals but under the in

276
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,340
california the bcc regs is any cannabis

277
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,769
that you use as consumption so if

278
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,540
individuals that produce tincture based

279
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,370
medicine and has to come through bcc

280
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:29,169
regulations under that umbrella and

281
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,669
that's something that's massive because

282
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:33,159
most of the people who got into him

283
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:35,049
really sold most of their product as an

284
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,909
edible tincture if you went to any one

285
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:39,789
of these stores it was 90% of the

286
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:41,049
products sold were edible tinctures so

287
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:42,819
everyone said oh man I'm gonna get into

288
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:46,109
hemp I'm just gonna kill it and the FDA

289
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,370
said sorry we want to do multiple

290
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,560
licensing agreements so to speak where

291
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,139
you'll get regulated as a hemp Purdue so

292
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,089
you can produce this but on this level

293
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:58,059
you have to produce it under the BCC and

294
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:00,430
so for Eric as a topical maker he can

295
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:02,619
now source hemp material but if he was

296
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:04,659
someone who was a tincture maker he's

297
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,210
not allowed to use hemp as a derivative

298
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:08,889
to make into that so if you're into any

299
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,330
of these with holistic medicine you have

300
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,639
to understand like where to source it

301
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,770
and like he said with the 2014 when he

302
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,720
released the chili verde the gas was on

303
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:19,120
fire like it's still on fire in the in

304
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,180
the in the hot markets but everybody

305
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,100
wanted fuel yeah it's the market changes

306
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,539
so fast one day they want one thing one

307
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,899
day the next day they want something

308
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:28,419
else

309
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,240
so diversify on what your breeding try

310
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:32,759
to get a little bit of a rayon

311
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,060
where you're at the oh geez the cheese's

312
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:38,370
the gases the fruits they come and go

313
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,629
and if you hold on to those stocks if

314
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,000
you're ready and you're watching the

315
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:44,009
market you'll be able to drop those and

316
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,860
a lot of the altar stuff comes around

317
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:49,139
you know if you are primarily looking

318
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,519
for the hottest thing on the market and

319
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,009
you're like oh I gotta have the skittle

320
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,750
gelato right now you may be left behind

321
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:58,620
because next year that it's not gonna be

322
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:00,389
the hottest thing and realistically in

323
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,549
breeding programs get a good testing

324
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:05,490
laboratory figure out where your numbers

325
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:08,819
are every single breeding project that I

326
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:11,070
do gets tested all those all those

327
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,990
genetics I have to know whether I'm

328
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,540
getting good terpene profiles what the

329
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,399
terpene profiles are what the numbers on

330
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,929
the percentages are and then from there

331
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:21,028
that gives me a base on what I'm going

332
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:23,819
to do with those plans as far as are

333
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:25,320
they getting good nutrient uptake as the

334
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,870
root structure good or the branch is

335
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,260
good and then from there I can start to

336
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,570
go into how does it how does it harvest

337
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,059
out how does it transfer over into the

338
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,278
market and then from there how does the

339
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:40,528
extract company come back to me and

340
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:42,570
there's a lot of array of what you are

341
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,939
looking for when you start to breed it's

342
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,440
not just crossing the hottest thing with

343
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,240
the hottest thing and dropping those

344
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,610
seeds in the market those are the guys

345
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,440
that get in trouble because they're

346
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,149
creating something that is based off

347
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,279
something else and they're not doing the

348
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:59,759
research or the time to develop the

349
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:01,620
plant as a whole completely across the

350
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,480
board I've made genetics before that I

351
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,159
was like oh my god this is amazing I

352
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,839
can't wait to get this out to the market

353
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,179
but then when we would get it into

354
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,100
certain areas they would burn up because

355
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,419
the temperatures they couldn't handle

356
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,120
hot temperatures or they can't handle

357
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:17,189
cold temperatures or you harvest them

358
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,919
and all the way through the growth the

359
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,470
plant is just stinking amazingly you

360
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,120
harvest it you cure it you get it in a

361
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,639
bag in a jar and all of a sudden it's

362
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,889
like oh there's nothing there those

363
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:33,139
strings those are the ones you have to

364
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:35,100
eliminate as you're going through the

365
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:39,509
again such a bunch of friends from

366
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:41,220
Europe and their large industrial seed

367
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:43,110
makers in Europe and we were having a

368
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,170
conversation about the success

369
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,480
of the variety ak-47 and we were talking

370
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:50,490
about how when Simon did the breeding on

371
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,289
it because he did huge populations of

372
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,480
10,000 the pullers pull his parental

373
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:56,129
stock out of what it did and he had

374
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,930
sourced all the material that he put

375
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,929
together and he only did five strains

376
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:03,899
total out of his catalogue what it did

377
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:05,939
was it let him take ak-47 and go into

378
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:09,149
the genomic material and swing the

379
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,010
direction then so if the market wanted

380
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:13,320
it to be more this he could go into it

381
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:15,539
and pull it and compete as a we would

382
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,790
call sativa one year he can compete as

383
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:20,639
an indica another year he could compete

384
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:22,889
as a mixed the year after all using the

385
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,828
same genomic material because he had

386
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:27,539
enough paint in that container to paint

387
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:29,939
whatever picture he wanted from the

388
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:33,088
tools that he had but ultimately it let

389
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,890
him still keep pushing ak-47 every

390
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,540
single time and I think that's all I

391
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,549
ever saying is that you got to have a

392
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,509
bigger picture and every one of the

393
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:41,069
breeders you talk about they're gonna

394
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:43,350
say the same similarity you have to have

395
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,300
a bigger long-term picture of what it is

396
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,699
you're trying to do because when you

397
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,319
chase trends typically you catch the

398
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:51,028
tail end of it it's kind of like stock

399
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,560
when most people when they get into the

400
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:53,909
stock they get in when they see it hot

401
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,369
but by the time they get in it they're

402
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:58,139
at the crest and then they make a Buy

403
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:02,310
and from that moment forward it's

404
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:05,669
diminishing returns know what if you go

405
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:09,319
to stay dry and uncomfortable as

406
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:12,509
possible on the stage as the key so you

407
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,760
know Kevin Kevin is used to it he can

408
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:16,319
talk forever on a mic I this is like the

409
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:20,208
third time I've ever actually been on

410
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,209
the mic so it's kind of difficult for me

411
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:28,039
[Applause]

412
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,360
but but we we brought you in to the last

413
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,759
event and we bring into this event

414
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,470
because it's not on the mic that that um

415
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,028
that's where you do your work you know

416
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,050
like for you you're you're a humble

417
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:40,879
quiet guy and it was just the fact that

418
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:43,399
you know you have a true love of what

419
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,649
you do and some of the work you've done

420
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,028
has been incredible and the hpk topicals

421
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:49,490
have always been well-received

422
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:52,278
and your varieties are well received and

423
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,839
as you sitting here now you know what

424
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,399
what what direction are you looking to

425
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,310
go with what you do and I you are you

426
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,708
trying to find you know hem producers to

427
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,859
work with to get cannabis to source like

428
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:05,419
what do you do now as a topical

429
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,299
manufacturer yeah my team now as a

430
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,880
topical producer uh solely um I have

431
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:12,529
decided to kind of wait out to FDA

432
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,689
figure out what they want to do with it

433
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:18,109
we have some money set aside for FDA

434
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:19,550
approval and licensing and then once

435
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,208
they figure out what they want to do

436
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:21,948
with him

437
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,380
hopefully I'll know they get some

438
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,808
funding or financers to back me up on

439
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,580
either creating my own production or

440
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:31,418
finding somebody that we can partner up

441
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:33,949
with to then pull that material and

442
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:36,169
what's the change in the hemp laws in

443
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,630
California in July it kind of really set

444
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:41,900
a lot of people back and it really

445
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,550
hindered the consumer to find these

446
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,530
products and now everybody scrambling

447
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:48,079
running around trying to figure it out

448
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:49,940
and so a lot of us just have to be

449
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:53,418
patient and I'm just being patient and

450
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,580
waiting it out I've been developing my

451
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:57,140
brand line I've been developing our

452
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:59,839
testing to make sure that we're

453
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,330
producing clean meds we just went

454
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:05,569
through pesticide and microbial testing

455
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:07,220
as well as cloten see and so that's

456
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:08,950
always something I've been focused on is

457
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,110
making sure I produce good clean meds

458
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,419
but as far as the hemp market goes it's

459
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:16,039
getting ready to blow up and I'm I'm

460
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,929
glad I'm kind of in a position to be

461
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,500
able to take advantage of that but at

462
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:23,630
the same time I'm not sure where I'm

463
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,849
gonna be at at this moment it's kind of

464
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:28,400
scary and so I see a lot of people out

465
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:32,449
there struggling and worried and and I'm

466
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,059
with you I'm there yeah so but yeah I'm

467
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,269
really thankful that I did created

468
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:41,869
Oh company in 2010 that I can now rely

469
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:44,450
on and hopefully if we can be very

470
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:48,109
existing successful that will then

471
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:51,200
hopefully transfer over into me getting

472
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:53,538
another farm license in creating my my

473
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,419
genetic brand again right now that's

474
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:59,929
just kind of on the side burner and yeah

475
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:01,940
that's where it's at so it's so awesome

476
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:04,999
to see that you made the transition and

477
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,159
I was I couldn't be any happier when I

478
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:09,769
saw you I saw you fly with flash across

479
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:11,720
the screen and I was like vindication

480
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:13,490
yeah yeah

481
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,069
nobody had was that caught me off-guard

482
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:20,089
- yeah it's really nice to see that you

483
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:22,788
know I spent so many years as a guerilla

484
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:25,638
grower and in the black market in the

485
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:27,740
early days that it's still really hard

486
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:30,138
for some of us to come out and talk and

487
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,480
tell people when we are doing and how we

488
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:35,298
are doing it because it's still really

489
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,368
scary for us the first time I talked

490
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:39,849
with Kevin I broke down at the end you

491
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:45,048
know you know it's really emotionally

492
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:46,459
tough for me but as the industry is

493
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:50,628
changing there are a lot of people like

494
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:53,960
myself who are now finding out that even

495
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:57,769
though we spent 25 years doing this the

496
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,179
industry at some point they respect that

497
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:01,638
but if you don't have an education

498
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:02,869
behind you and a firm understanding of

499
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:06,019
what you're doing and how you're doing

500
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:08,449
it to to give that back to the public

501
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:10,460
you will be left behind fast I've been

502
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,619
told by several people lately that I am

503
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,538
overqualified and under-qualified at the

504
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:17,480
same time I dropped out of high school

505
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:20,118
to grow cannabis in the early 90s and I

506
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,249
spent 20 years in the bush is learning

507
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:24,648
how to grow cannabis very well but

508
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:27,379
recently I've had problems with the new

509
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:29,778
industry that came in they wanted they

510
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:32,569
want paperwork behind them they want to

511
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:33,798
know what kind of you know agricultural

512
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:36,259
degrees I have what kind of plant

513
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:38,359
science do you have what kind of college

514
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:42,528
background do you have and that has been

515
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:44,928
tough for me because I don't have that

516
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:46,960
but I know how to grow amazing cannabis

517
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:50,140
I know what the plant is like and

518
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,210
and so courses like this the more you

519
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,850
can get out there get that put onto your

520
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,190
resume learn things that will help you

521
00:20:54,849 --> 00:21:00,189
down the road and I think the natural

522
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,870
Korean organic farming will start to

523
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,640
take over bigger in the commercial

524
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:06,119
industry because a lot of these people

525
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,860
are realizing that they don't want

526
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:11,289
pharmaceutical products and when you're

527
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:13,659
using nutrients salt based products

528
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:15,339
those transfer over into the product

529
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,650
that you're smoking and a lot of the

530
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:19,899
consumers are now figuring that out so

531
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,840
you see a decline in the hydro base

532
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,640
markets and we've been really starts to

533
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,459
learn how to get your natural Korean

534
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,130
IMO's down you get your organics down

535
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:33,670
you get your Google culture down doubt

536
00:21:30,130 --> 00:22:08,370
is only going to help with your overall

537
00:21:33,670 --> 00:22:14,550
brand questions let's create the market

538
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:17,199
know an answer no but that's because

539
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:20,589
what happened with cannabis was a

540
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,680
travesty occurred and the laboratory was

541
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:26,349
created and no one really understood how

542
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,070
to use the lab and so what they find is

543
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:31,750
a twenty must be better than a ten and

544
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:34,210
five Terp is better than three-term and

545
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:38,140
so all of a sudden this perception of

546
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:40,990
numerics became valued and the customers

547
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:44,140
started to believe that if I spend 40

548
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:47,410
bucks for a bag and it's a 28 it's gonna

549
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:50,080
give me more usage than a $40 bag that's

550
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:52,750
22 and so it's a perception of

551
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,939
efficiency and dosage usage so titration

552
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,660
how much I consume based off what the

553
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,370
numerix are and the problem is is that

554
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:03,538
nobody really was able to get the

555
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:06,178
education out quick enough because it

556
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:08,609
was a new industry and so this

557
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,288
incredible dumbing down occurred to

558
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:12,149
where people don't really understand

559
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:15,058
that what they want to do is consume a

560
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:17,250
product that gives them satisfaction and

561
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:20,160
efficacy and that's not necessarily

562
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,950
numerically connected and so over the

563
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,440
course of time you'll see those products

564
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,870
rise up and move forward but right now

565
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,029
you're having to fight an uphill battle

566
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:31,739
to advertise it and I think that what's

567
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:33,690
gonna save us is that the people that

568
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,490
are coming into cannabis who aren't

569
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,970
caught up in numbers and aren't caught

570
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:41,159
up in in the past of cannabis they're

571
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,380
gonna want good cannabis and so I use

572
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,630
people who are very light smokers that

573
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,090
are extremely heavily affected by THC

574
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,480
Dom stuff and I try to find interesting

575
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:54,779
ratios interesting Turk profiles and

576
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,298
that they're happy with because we can't

577
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:59,730
be used as the test case because we're

578
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:03,480
basically immune to normal smoke so

579
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:06,569
we're bad as a tester for that yeah

580
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,610
we're bad yardstick so you know I think

581
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:10,470
that that's the case and and but for

582
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:12,538
like what he does with it with the

583
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,710
topical blends and stuff that's a

584
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:16,379
different usage

585
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:19,460
just like with the extracts or the

586
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:22,559
textures because that is about ratios

587
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,179
cannabinoids tert profiles in in a form

588
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,009
where the people that are buying it

589
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,630
aren't looking at the numbers some of

590
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:30,179
the most successful stuff we sold almost

591
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:32,340
had zero numbers on right now there's a

592
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,720
big shift in which market that's about

593
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:35,970
to happen because you have the Central

594
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,490
Valley getting ready to come on with

595
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:42,240
major hemp production and when you are a

596
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:44,640
farmer if you cannot farm twenty acres

597
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,089
or more of him you will not stay in the

598
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,669
game when you are making concentrates or

599
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:53,308
isolates or distillates from those you

600
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:55,950
need to be big in the game at this point

601
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:57,389
now when it comes to the cannabis

602
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,730
industry you still have a lot of leeway

603
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,559
as a smaller farmer you can still work

604
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,259
with that but as the Central Valley

605
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:05,639
comes online do you better be ready to

606
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:07,339
compete with those guys because they're

607
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,650
gonna be dumping massive amounts

608
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,740
and the general consumer populations

609
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:15,920
south of Sacramento realistically they

610
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,200
don't really the bait cartridge market

611
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,450
is big with CBD but the general consumer

612
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,940
is not really looking for flour that

613
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,500
tests less than 20% because they're not

614
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,840
really smoking it everybody that's

615
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,579
looking for it is concentrating it down

616
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,919
and then selling it to the people that

617
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:33,019
are making products like myself and like

618
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,940
myself it's easier cheaper to buy

619
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:36,619
isolate than it is to try to buy a pound

620
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,840
of flour and then concentrate it down

621
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:41,659
and to make it into my products that way

622
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:43,789
so I told somebody recently that was

623
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,460
asking on The Hague what's up Carville

624
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:48,799
now page about growing hemp this year or

625
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,210
CBD and I said you know you might want

626
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,549
to seriously think about staying with

627
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,529
craft cannabis because once the Central

628
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:57,619
Valley and the hemp initiative comes

629
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:59,720
online you're gonna be going up against

630
00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:01,459
multi-million dollar contracts and I

631
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,960
don't know if you're seeing that now but

632
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,170
down in the Central Valley where I'm at

633
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,960
they are hot about going big I mean I'm

634
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:11,150
I'm doing consultant work in the

635
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,460
relationship working in Colorado you're

636
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:16,790
talking thousand acres thousand thousand

637
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,289
acre farmers in norm and that's

638
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:20,299
frightening you know that's a tough

639
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:23,509
thing to compete against my my buddy

640
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:25,730
knows a guy that is the largest hops

641
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:29,029
producer in Washington his only client

642
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:31,640
is an either bush so he sells the one

643
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:35,539
person only and he has a robotic

644
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,030
automated hops farm and he has a 30

645
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:39,470
million dollar extraction unit that does

646
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,420
the extract and he can do twenty

647
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:45,350
thousand pounds an hour of extract and

648
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:47,360
he showed me a jar of hops diamonds and

649
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:49,339
and hops Turks and I said what the hell

650
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,419
was that he goes tops bro and I said

651
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,740
what are you guys doing it with that he

652
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,630
goes that's how we sell it to Budweiser

653
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,039
they don't they don't buy it they buy it

654
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:58,790
as an extract and they added to their

655
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:01,899
beer mix and it blew my mind to see a 30

656
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:05,389
million dollar extraction device

657
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:08,360
robotics orders robotics sifting the

658
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:11,690
hemp industry is gonna basically be corn

659
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:14,059
and the part of it that won't be will be

660
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,250
in the edible form because the FDA won't

661
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:17,779
let you consume that they let you put it

662
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,730
on your body and they'll let you smoke

663
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:22,160
it but they won't let you consume it

664
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,329
and so it's the for you as an individual

665
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,710
where if you wanted as we talk about

666
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:26,809
genetics early if you want to stratify

667
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,569
what you're doing then you produce

668
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:32,359
things that are gonna catch the ethereal

669
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:33,799
market mental market lifts and then you

670
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,109
catch the stuff of people who want to

671
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:38,389
have health and wellness and that means

672
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:41,719
that part of your product diversity

673
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,490
could be CBD material but CVD and ratios

674
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,440
that work with tert profiles that work

675
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,660
that lets you do some form of efficient

676
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,820
cold extraction so that you're able to

677
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:53,240
actually get product out that goes under

678
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:55,669
your label that lets people who use your

679
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,950
label now see that you're valid there

680
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,480
and move forward what I was involved in

681
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,430
all the initial release of CBD in the

682
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,870
United States so I'm one of the first

683
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,640
people to touch CBD and I definitely

684
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:06,079
released more CBD than anybody probably

685
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,490
other than Stanley Brothers and they're

686
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:12,349
working off the stuff they bootleg from

687
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:14,299
us so the the point of this is that I

688
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:16,250
saw the evolution of this and people

689
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:18,889
asked me why did you give up so much

690
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:22,069
material for free and I said because

691
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:24,680
when you have a necessity you have a

692
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:28,250
validity and if we can get people to use

693
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,470
CBD medicine and get it fairly priced in

694
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,329
my case free what happens is they see

695
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,860
all of us as cannabis producers

696
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:35,839
differently they realize that we're not

697
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:38,299
social pariah that we were painted to be

698
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,220
and if mainstream people can use a

699
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:42,529
product and use a topical from Eric and

700
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,299
say man that made a radical difference

701
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:47,690
in the quality of my health

702
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:49,669
he's valid when their son comes in and

703
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,650
said they sell weed to I don't know

704
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,910
let's look it up and all of a sudden

705
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,800
they become you a brand ambassador

706
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,440
because what you've done is you've taken

707
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,750
away somebody's arthritis my mother who

708
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,990
was a staunch antique anibus individual

709
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:05,299
where the shit was demonic um when she

710
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:08,120
got cancer I was able to help her with

711
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:09,559
CBD medicine and my mother is now this

712
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:11,029
cannabis advocate that's almost

713
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,619
hysterical because she's in every single

714
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:14,539
thing I'm doing everybody she's talking

715
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:17,029
to it they're like boy your mother's so

716
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:18,769
pro cannabis and I said because it did

717
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:21,230
something for her that changed her

718
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:22,940
opinion and because of that she realized

719
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,460
that she had chosen wrongly in a

720
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,519
judgement so she reversed her decision

721
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,630
and now she tries to utilize that

722
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,579
education and knowledge to help people

723
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,140
and that's really where you take a look

724
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:35,210
at some of the CBD pieces because

725
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:37,790
is the tremendous amount of people that

726
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,730
need that a far more than need to

727
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:43,069
consume it in smoke and when you touch

728
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,980
that population and you do it elegantly

729
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:47,869
and graciously it changes how not only

730
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,849
do they view you but they view all of us

731
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,869
that way and what I wanted to do is I

732
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:52,699
wanted to be able to continue in

733
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:53,959
cannabis my whole career and the only

734
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,580
way I was gonna be able to do that is if

735
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,840
I could get the mainstream not to see me

736
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:58,579
as somebody that they wanted to put in

737
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:01,429
prison perpetually and the only way that

738
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:03,319
can happen is if you have a value and so

739
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:04,880
you have these abilities but you have to

740
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:06,559
be very intelligent about how much of

741
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,790
your product are you selling in that

742
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:13,490
form so some small portion of CVD - the

743
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:14,899
ones one - ones high turf levels so that

744
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,789
there's aromatic because I'm cold

745
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,200
extractions it's this whole synthesis

746
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:21,349
that actually gives you the efficacy

747
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,240
that you're seeking and you make so that

748
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:25,579
it works to you you can put it under

749
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,559
your label it work that's what you do as

750
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:29,449
a flower producer so you get to do your

751
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,089
flower you get to catch a medical market

752
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:35,900
and you stay out of commercial hemp

753
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:37,549
unless you are a real farmer where

754
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,440
you're talking silos and you're talking

755
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,430
John Deere equipment because you're

756
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,110
gonna compete with some giants Czerny

757
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:58,490
anybody with questions that pertain to

758
00:30:45,109 --> 00:31:00,469
breeding I know you take that you see

759
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:03,259
more of that than I do well totally I

760
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:05,960
see it but but see what what when when

761
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:08,629
you doing what he's doing what he says

762
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,660
what he says I see a quality and as

763
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:14,600
someone who's got career time when I

764
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:16,730
spent 21 five years doing it I know that

765
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,379
this is a quality product and I know

766
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:21,140
that if it was presented in the right

767
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,790
form it would sell and then what you

768
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,790
have to do then is be able to figure out

769
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:29,299
where it belongs and seasonal shifts are

770
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:31,700
based off of media hype based off of

771
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:32,899
good advertising based off of things

772
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,759
that are usually bigger than you and

773
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,009
what you want to do is you want to

774
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:39,200
create a portfolio of things that allow

775
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:41,000
you to fill those holes as they open and

776
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,830
when they close you just retract and put

777
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,500
something else in and so good readers

778
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:46,019
are going to work on

779
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,490
variety aligns but not so many that they

780
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:49,440
don't have control of what they're doing

781
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,390
and what it does it allows you to deal

782
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,680
with the realities of human nature where

783
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,509
they don't always want the same thing

784
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,509
every day but they don't want too many

785
00:31:54,509 --> 00:32:00,329
different things and where you live is a

786
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:01,559
huge situation for that where if you're

787
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:04,379
in Southern California it's

788
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:06,569
exclusiveness so it's things that nobody

789
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,730
has so as soon as it gets out it's no

790
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:11,099
longer trendy and if I take a picture of

791
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:13,170
myself smoking it I'm not that sexy but

792
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:15,209
if no one else has it I'm incredible and

793
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:17,130
so the ability to understand the

794
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,319
mentality of how things move and work is

795
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,730
huge but that's why like whatever it

796
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:24,299
does is because the stuff that he worked

797
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:28,440
with that I used he had done years prior

798
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:30,720
and it hadn't lost its appeal and so the

799
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,670
quality of the work still resonated

800
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,339
because his desire to create a quality

801
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,650
product was there and his knowledge of

802
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:39,569
what the market wanted was there and now

803
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:41,640
the question is how do we move it into

804
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:44,579
the right locations and that's where you

805
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,380
have to have this this organic group so

806
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:48,359
that you as a cultivator can say hey

807
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,400
wait a second my shifts not trendy right

808
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,689
now and you find out somebody that I got

809
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,269
the trendy stuff I'll hook you up and

810
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,759
then you're able to catch the whole fill

811
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:58,889
the need get the check continue forward

812
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,720
and then next year your stuff is sexy

813
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,220
again right and that's kind of as a

814
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,380
breeder you have to make a decision on

815
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,769
what you're doing for me I have specific

816
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:10,230
lines that I work and I stay within I am

817
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:12,420
NOT a trend I'm not I'm not following

818
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:15,089
the hottest trend I have specific lines

819
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:18,029
that I work that I like that work for me

820
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:19,740
and that's where I stay at and I have a

821
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:22,349
lot of people that look at my menu and

822
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,900
they say hey there's no skittles on here

823
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:26,039
there's no gelato there's you know

824
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,570
there's all these strains and they sit

825
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:30,029
and quilt that's not what I work with I

826
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:32,789
work specifically in certain things and

827
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:35,129
you have to make a decision as a breeder

828
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:37,139
and what you're going to breed are you

829
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,120
going to be trying to just follow

830
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,180
everybody else or are you working your

831
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,779
specific lines and how those lines work

832
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,779
for you

833
00:33:45,069 --> 00:34:03,879
so I've been working in genetics dad you

834
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,309
have to make a decision whether so what

835
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,650
he's asking is he's asking he's holding

836
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:10,869
some clonal stock that's local that he's

837
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:13,418
had forever but they're clonal stock and

838
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:15,668
now he wants to create seen from those

839
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:17,440
clonal stock so what you have to do is

840
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:19,329
you have to make a decision do you want

841
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,240
to you can make you can make feminized

842
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:24,819
seed from those by spraying them and

843
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,099
making seed stock from those or you can

844
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,620
cross pollinate those with a male that

845
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:32,500
you've brought in or you can do a sub

846
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:34,839
cross and try to be no hot back out

847
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,449
those lines and then use those genetics

848
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,590
to make your own stock with that's kind

849
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:43,349
of the only problem with that is that

850
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:46,660
the genetic package that you're holding

851
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:48,940
sometimes is unique so how many times do

852
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:53,319
your parents have to recreate a child to

853
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:55,030
get you a lot and so if it's cannabis

854
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,950
varieties that have specific properties

855
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,110
and we have a variety that seemed to

856
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:00,129
work for spasticity and so I tell people

857
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,200
that's the one thing I'm never going to

858
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,090
get rid of because it has a power that

859
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,769
I've haven't seen in any other varietal

860
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:07,840
because across the board it works for a

861
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:10,389
thing and I tried to substitute

862
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,420
everything to find out something that

863
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:14,679
was similar and it didn't matter and I

864
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,300
don't think we're intelligent enough at

865
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,759
this point to understand these little

866
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:22,330
intricate details because the synergy of

867
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,430
the turps cannabinoids oils relationship

868
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:26,769
between bacteria all those things create

869
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:30,399
too much information to be able to just

870
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:32,980
say it's that so what I know is you take

871
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,010
that in sell fit hold the material keep

872
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,349
the clone if it is priceless keep the

873
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,940
clone you can people have huge

874
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:42,309
collections but I'm like what are you

875
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,740
collecting for some things just are

876
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:46,150
generic but some things like if you have

877
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:48,009
something that you collected that you

878
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,900
said man this is my core thing I love it

879
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,880
I just wish I could hold it and not have

880
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,980
to play with it you might just find that

881
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,140
the real truth of it is is that hold it

882
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,719
in some seed form where you have some of

883
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:59,519
the genetic material

884
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:00,659
hold the clone don't get rid of the

885
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,300
Cologne because this clones that I've

886
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:05,309
had that I cannot replace I don't give a

887
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,940
shit how many seeds I go through I can't

888
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:09,529
find him

889
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,530
cuz guy in the back has been grabbing

890
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:22,320
long term his question was about

891
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:25,230
long-term seed storage that that's kind

892
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,450
of that's opening a can of worms for me

893
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:31,320
sort of because I'll take some abuse on

894
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:33,149
this but for me I don't like to freeze

895
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,099
long term freeze my seeds because I've

896
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:38,099
had bad problems with that later on down

897
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:40,289
the road because as a as a general

898
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,700
consumer I can only buy the freezer

899
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:43,920
that's on the market and if the power

900
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,539
goes out or if it breaks down I'm

901
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,070
struggling to try to get those seeds

902
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:53,639
refrozen again so for me what I like to

903
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:57,300
do is I'll I'll store them in in sealed

904
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:59,730
jars in dark area and just below room

905
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,590
temperature and I've never had problems

906
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,349
with my seat stock lasting you know

907
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,769
pretty I've had seed stock for 10-15

908
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:09,980
years that still pop within 24 hours

909
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:13,588
what happens is a lot of people will

910
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,269
miss store their seats by freezing them

911
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:17,130
and when you're opening and closing the

912
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:19,320
door constantly or pulling those to that

913
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,088
whole entire seat batch out you go

914
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,609
through all your seeds they defrost then

915
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:25,588
you put them back in the freezer

916
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:27,539
sometimes that has a longevity issue and

917
00:37:25,588 --> 00:37:30,269
you will degrade your seeds but I have

918
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:32,849
other breeder friends that swear by only

919
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:35,190
keeping them fully frozen all the time

920
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:39,000
it's it's a personal issue with you but

921
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:41,460
heat will screw up your seeds you get up

922
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,190
above 80 90 degrees and it's prolonged

923
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,630
your seats are not gonna last long

924
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:48,358
that's just for personal experience

925
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:50,880
living in SoCal well the moisture

926
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:53,039
fluctuations screw you to where you you

927
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,108
you get the seed to get moisture in it

928
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:56,699
and it activates the enzymes and then

929
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:58,440
you reach chill it dry it and it

930
00:37:56,699 --> 00:38:00,329
deactivates it except if you utilize

931
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,679
some of it and if you repeat that

932
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:04,079
process a couple times there's not much

933
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,149
left on the seed and so we can go into

934
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,940
the lab and we can go in vitro and get

935
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,829
into the seed but the

936
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,929
problem is that it's just like with

937
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:14,090
tissue culture there the number of

938
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:15,919
mediums that you have to use to find the

939
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:19,579
right base formulation usually is around

940
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,409
10 so if you're trying to do a TC op you

941
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:24,289
got at least 10 base formulations you

942
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:26,599
use you find the one that's closest from

943
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:28,279
there you start to refine and that's why

944
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,420
it takes so long to do tissue culture

945
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,010
with cannabis is because you don't have

946
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,260
a recipe book you can pop up like for

947
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,610
orchid so I can pop up a book and I can

948
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,590
pull out a recipe and say this has been

949
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:38,090
formulated by these scientists from Duke

950
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,950
and they say use this

951
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,450
well cannabis you don't have that and

952
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:43,759
anybody who does is holding that shit in

953
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:46,759
their pocket cuz it's a lot of work so

954
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,010
I'm trying to crack seeds from 70s that

955
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,260
I know haven't been held right but I

956
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,680
know that there's still enough material

957
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:56,540
to salvage and it's just a process for

958
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:57,889
the labs to be able to create the

959
00:38:56,539 --> 00:39:01,250
auguste solution and the hormonal

960
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:02,629
concentrations to allow it to open up

961
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,519
and start to move so they can get

962
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,619
cellular activity so they can harvest

963
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:10,340
some form of cell that they can then

964
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:12,500
micro propagate that and go forward but

965
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:15,200
you know for the average person you know

966
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:18,050
to scrub a plant at lowest cost at 6

967
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:20,389
grand for a meristem scrub average is 10

968
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:23,090
so if every plant you touch is 10 grand

969
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:26,359
I mean let's see it's kind of costly and

970
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:27,559
so like for me holdin seeds it with the

971
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,960
difference I think too is that when

972
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:32,299
you're someone makes seeds you're taking

973
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,639
them to fruition and you are running the

974
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:37,400
mothers till the seeds aren't completely

975
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:40,159
fully stacked with carbohydrates so you

976
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,170
have a true time capsule then he takes

977
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,539
this seed that was fully developed and

978
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:47,420
then he holds it at a humidity level and

979
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:49,489
a temperature range that buffers it when

980
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:52,280
you go buy a pack of seeds if it's a

981
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:53,689
trendy seed half of a white because the

982
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,160
money's there so yeah they might crack

983
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,389
but they're not gonna hold because they

984
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,399
weren't developed enough so they don't

985
00:39:56,389 --> 00:40:00,379
have a large enough sugar storage within

986
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,869
them to be able to give you what you

987
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:05,030
need and so for guys like Eric that a

988
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:07,130
seed makers they have a far better

989
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,480
ability to preserve see than the average

990
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,309
person because the average person

991
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,750
doesn't realize that that plant has to

992
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:14,630
basically look like shit

993
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:17,000
when you harvest those seeds the you are

994
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:19,140
taking it way past the visual Beauty

995
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,900
because you're harvesting seed

996
00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:24,028
now once you do that I would recommend

997
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,009
you run a desiccant pack and you put

998
00:40:24,028 --> 00:40:27,298
them in a seal-a-meal and that way you

999
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:29,009
can seal them up so that you're not

1000
00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:31,018
having any infiltration and it keeps

1001
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:33,210
them nice and flat and what it doesn't

1002
00:40:31,018 --> 00:40:34,498
let you stack them up in a bin and if

1003
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,259
you can put them in a cellar or a

1004
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:38,759
basement or a cold storage it's how it's

1005
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:40,798
done historically so I don't like these

1006
00:40:38,759 --> 00:40:44,849
I don't like the freezers either because

1007
00:40:40,798 --> 00:40:46,829
I've always had power problems and so

1008
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:48,809
unless you have a full time power supply

1009
00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:52,349
there's an issue and people talk about

1010
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:54,210
oh it's possible but I watched the

1011
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:57,420
scientists running out of the seed bank

1012
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:59,159
in Antarctica with paper boxes with the

1013
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,989
most valuable genomic material on earth

1014
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,578
running for their fucking lives and I

1015
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:03,960
said well they spend a hundred million

1016
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,670
dollars to build that and they're

1017
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,009
putting things in paper bags running for

1018
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:11,539
their lives the odds of me getting

1019
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:13,798
around that probably pretty slim so I

1020
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:17,210
kind of look at it the way he does where

1021
00:41:13,798 --> 00:41:20,190
I try to hold material but I hold it in

1022
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:22,199
sealed sealed meals so that I can

1023
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:24,329
flatten them out so that I can hold more

1024
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:27,509
material other than big containers of

1025
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:30,089
jars and if I could do it correctly when

1026
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:32,400
I do the ceiling on it I seal up a

1027
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:33,929
second pack that's small so if I want to

1028
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,160
pull something out and play with it I

1029
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:37,588
can I don't have to open up the whole

1030
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:40,379
package otherwise what I'm doing is I'm

1031
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:41,578
cracking the whole pack and now you have

1032
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,559
to go through the process again and

1033
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:45,599
every time we open it up we expose it to

1034
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,390
oxygen we expose it to change in

1035
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,190
humidity and if we humidify this we

1036
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:51,989
activate the enzymes we start the

1037
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,019
biological process and then we have to

1038
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:56,670
shorten it it doesn't work well and one

1039
00:41:55,018 --> 00:41:59,038
of the things I like to do too is I'll

1040
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:00,690
do an initial 24 hour freeze right after

1041
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,359
harvest and we shuck and clean the seeds

1042
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:05,639
they will get frozen for 24 hours and

1043
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,650
for me it's kind of um it's kind of like

1044
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:10,139
winter set in it's called that seed that

1045
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,509
yeah they've analyzed that seed that

1046
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:14,368
winners come it's ready and then as you

1047
00:42:12,509 --> 00:42:16,889
pull it out of that 24 hour freeze then

1048
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:18,329
it goes into our humidity packs where

1049
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:20,670
we're putting them away at just below

1050
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:23,160
room temperature so that seed has been

1051
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:25,318
gone through its full cycle so it's you

1052
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:27,480
you've read it it's gone through the

1053
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:29,219
full cycle you've harvested it winter

1054
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,369
has been it's you know it's gone through

1055
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:33,889
its winter cycle and now

1056
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:36,710
ready to be propagated once you're ready

1057
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:38,659
for that so initial 24-hour furries for

1058
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,920
me has always kind of been initial but I

1059
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:42,409
always like to make sure they're clean

1060
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,670
before we freeze them because I don't

1061
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:45,230
want to have plant material in there

1062
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,960
because the plant material I'll notice

1063
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:49,608
will point more stir and and I learned

1064
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,019
you know years ago from people that were

1065
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:53,358
running mountain varieties that they

1066
00:42:51,018 --> 00:42:55,459
vernal eyes before they cracked so they

1067
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:58,308
would take the seed they would do cold

1068
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,139
treatment and then soak it cold and then

1069
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,460
it stimulated growth because that was

1070
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:03,230
the natural genomic pattern of the

1071
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,929
varietals but stuff that was equatorial

1072
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:08,298
was opposite was higher higher warmth

1073
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:10,248
levels so depending on you know where

1074
00:43:08,298 --> 00:43:12,980
your original stock comes from you have

1075
00:43:10,248 --> 00:43:16,459
different strategies but the main thing

1076
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,650
is to make sure that you're doing enough

1077
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:21,318
preservation and you have enough seed

1078
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:23,509
that you're able to actually go back in

1079
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:25,308
in mine and people that are doing really

1080
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:26,480
work a good work on this what they're

1081
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:29,329
doing is they're refreshing this

1082
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,710
population every five years you just

1083
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:32,420
can't put stuff away for the rest of

1084
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:35,269
your life you have to basically go back

1085
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,980
in and then do an open pollination with

1086
00:43:35,268 --> 00:43:38,659
your stock where you're taking a variety

1087
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,039
of males and a variety of females so

1088
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:43,129
that you're picking up as much genetic

1089
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:44,778
material as possible and then when you

1090
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,548
go back into it you can steer the

1091
00:43:44,778 --> 00:43:49,298
direction you want based off the needs

1092
00:43:46,548 --> 00:43:49,298
that you have then

1093
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:08,828
um you know that's kind of personal

1094
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:12,039
preference also um when selecting males

1095
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:14,619
I I'm kind of looking for certain traits

1096
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:18,000
that I want to add into my females so

1097
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:20,710
either structure or I'm looking for

1098
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,489
colors or I'm looking for terpene

1099
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:27,550
profiles or I'm looking for diversity as

1100
00:44:24,489 --> 00:44:30,759
far as nutrient uptake or stability as

1101
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:32,470
far as heat stress mold things like that

1102
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,839
and that comes with a little bit of

1103
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:36,818
trial and error so a lot of breeders

1104
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,259
will do open pollination so they have a

1105
00:44:36,818 --> 00:44:40,449
little bit of diversity so that they're

1106
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:43,710
not choosing just one male to make their

1107
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:46,179
population with it

1108
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:48,210
pre testing them that's why I have a lab

1109
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:51,009
I'll go through and pre test my males

1110
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,539
you'll actually have a THC content in

1111
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:56,530
your males and you can kind of tell

1112
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:59,529
through diversity of how far you think

1113
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:01,839
that male will pull your teensy content

1114
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:05,230
to a plant because I've tested males and

1115
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:07,389
they show very little anywhere anywhere

1116
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:08,829
after six to eight weeks but normally

1117
00:45:07,389 --> 00:45:11,588
I'll wait until they start to drop

1118
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:13,539
pollen I'll cut some of those pollen

1119
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:15,250
sacks with some of the leaf stem

1120
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:17,710
material and then I'll send that in and

1121
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,900
ask for a potency test and that kind of

1122
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:22,539
gives me a low ratio what I'm doing and

1123
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:25,588
I like to use my tests to figure out

1124
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:28,929
where my ratio is on what I'm doing but

1125
00:45:25,588 --> 00:45:30,338
realistically you'll know when you find

1126
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:32,078
your males and you're going through them

1127
00:45:30,338 --> 00:45:33,578
there will be certain males that are not

1128
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,440
doing as well or they don't have as good

1129
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:37,119
a structure or they just don't have that

1130
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,059
smell that you're looking for and you

1131
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,280
can kind of eliminate them out it when

1132
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:45,480
you're getting into big Pinot hunts then

1133
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,640
kind of some things change on that but

1134
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:52,088
holding in males a small property with a

1135
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,679
small section can be tough you almost

1136
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:55,929
want our own separate greenhouse that

1137
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:58,058
you can seal off or an indoor where you

1138
00:45:55,929 --> 00:46:00,879
can keep them separated or work with a

1139
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:02,500
friend whose house of six plant license

1140
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,568
and you can throw some males at their

1141
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,960
place and it's not going to populate

1142
00:46:04,568 --> 00:46:08,989
anybody in their surrounding

1143
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,190
area you know that's why breeding is so

1144
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:13,250
tough because you have to almost

1145
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:15,710
dedicate yourself to breeding or not

1146
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,750
breeding people that try to side breed

1147
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,990
end up with a lot of material that ends

1148
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:22,880
up with seed later on and then your your

1149
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:29,659
customers are like hey I got some got

1150
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:32,690
some seeds what's up you know it as a

1151
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:34,129
quick win like what I would people were

1152
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,559
having problems because their their

1153
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,300
varietals didn't have enough numerix and

1154
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,949
so I said look let me sift you out some

1155
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,269
males to make this happen because it's

1156
00:46:39,949 --> 00:46:43,730
easy because I'm gonna sit I'm gonna

1157
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:47,929
sift for a specific trait and so I can

1158
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:49,969
do a sack crack 200 seeds within a week

1159
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:52,098
or two of growth and I have my first

1160
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:54,709
true leaf after the coital Eden I can

1161
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:57,500
take a stamp and sex them and call out

1162
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:59,389
all my females right because I'm only

1163
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,190
looking for males then I can let these

1164
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:02,838
males grow up to they're about eight to

1165
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,400
ten inches and I can take the top four

1166
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:06,710
inches off and send it into a lab for

1167
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,450
predicated analysis that predicate of

1168
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:11,900
analysis is gonna tell me right at that

1169
00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:15,980
moment what are my THC CBD CBG levels

1170
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:17,180
and in ratios I always look for high CBG

1171
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,440
levels because that's the base

1172
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:20,269
cannabinoid all cannabinoids are

1173
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,429
converted from so if I'm looking at

1174
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:23,949
numbers and I have a huge CVG reserve I

1175
00:47:22,429 --> 00:47:26,899
know there's a lot more left in the tank

1176
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:28,939
and then I can look at these ratios and

1177
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,220
I can say okay we're in a ratio that we

1178
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:34,159
like and we have disproportionate totals

1179
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:36,799
we start to use that population of males

1180
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:39,319
to go into other plants that I want to

1181
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,480
increase and then I measure the progeny

1182
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,338
the children did I increase what I

1183
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,858
wanted to increase and then we're able

1184
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:48,289
to find out which male through the stamp

1185
00:47:45,858 --> 00:47:50,750
then I can take that population and do

1186
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:53,420
it again and I can start narrowing down

1187
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:56,358
the amount of plants it takes me to get

1188
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:59,030
into a specific characteristic and I was

1189
00:47:56,358 --> 00:48:01,429
going after numbers heavily for people

1190
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:02,930
that I they needed to sell pot and if

1191
00:48:01,429 --> 00:48:04,579
you're in the dispensary business and

1192
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:06,529
you don't have numbers that are real you

1193
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:09,559
screwed and so what I did is I use the

1194
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:13,519
same tools we use to go from 5% CBD to

1195
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:15,889
20% CBD in a year to basically do with

1196
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:17,269
THC plants so it let me get a hold of

1197
00:48:15,889 --> 00:48:19,309
material that I knew could throw heavy

1198
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:21,170
numbers on something and then I

1199
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:23,179
gave those males the people who wanted

1200
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,800
to get into breeding because they had an

1201
00:48:23,179 --> 00:48:26,389
incredible collection but they were

1202
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,060
working with varietals that were 14 to

1203
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:31,250
17 and I needed to get him up to 27 so

1204
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:34,369
we found can we find males that

1205
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:36,619
consistently added one thing which was

1206
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:39,319
numerix and then from the numeric

1207
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:41,150
population you pull out the quality so

1208
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,830
ultimately it's always this sifting

1209
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:45,170
process that you're going through but

1210
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:47,420
lab analytics are helped incredibly and

1211
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,010
now with marker assisted reading and the

1212
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:51,170
ability to look at the plant to say you

1213
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,670
know how homozygous or heterozygous is

1214
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,460
it meaning how much of the trade is

1215
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,720
going to be carried and moved it helps

1216
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,369
you because if there's too much

1217
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:00,589
diversity then you're having to do too

1218
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:03,559
big a population hunt and for regular

1219
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:06,800
people that's a lot of work it's

1220
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:08,960
expensive to every time you guys all

1221
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,420
know what testing costs so every time

1222
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,960
you throw in a lab test you know 100 200

1223
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:17,930
300 bucks and so as a breeder for me it

1224
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,420
gets very expensive and at some point so

1225
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:24,519
yeah so when somebody says hey I'm

1226
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,519
asking this much for pakka seats it's

1227
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:38,250
the on look I'm looking for if I'm if

1228
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,829
I'm doing what I was doing at that time

1229
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:44,460
all like just like with CVD all we cared

1230
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:47,219
about was increasing CBD levels because

1231
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,380
the numbers were too low so once I get a

1232
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:52,649
population of plants that produce a

1233
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,360
higher overall level of CBD now I can go

1234
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:56,280
through those populations and do my

1235
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,650
resistance testing I can do my

1236
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,080
production testing but I can get every

1237
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:02,070
other quality I want and if it's 3% CBD

1238
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:04,500
I failed

1239
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:06,450
and so with marketable cannabis in

1240
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:09,480
today's industry I needed up in these

1241
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:11,879
higher numbers 28 to 30 well I went into

1242
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,130
some of these chem lines and I started

1243
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,320
spending some time using predicates of

1244
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,940
lab analysis which just lets me all it

1245
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,330
ball it means is that I'm doing testing

1246
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:24,809
in juvenile stages and with CBD plants

1247
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:26,670
it's not as cement meaning that with THC

1248
00:50:24,809 --> 00:50:29,909
the numbers stay pretty consistent but

1249
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:32,820
with CBD sometimes you end up having as

1250
00:50:29,909 --> 00:50:36,569
the plant matures ratios shift a little

1251
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:38,610
bit not as not as accurate but with

1252
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:41,400
predicated of THC analysis I see a

1253
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:45,000
higher level of accuracy with CBD we saw

1254
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,570
less but the bottom line is if I'm

1255
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,929
looking for one trait that's not hard

1256
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:54,240
look for 20 traits that's hard that's

1257
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:56,519
real reading but so what I was doing was

1258
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:58,849
increasing the cell ability of cultivars

1259
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:01,559
that were sexy but not sexy enough now

1260
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:03,150
and I just used lab analysis and because

1261
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:06,000
I was fortunate that I was involved with

1262
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:08,220
so many labs and I was able to drive

1263
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,320
business to the labs once you make money

1264
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:12,329
for people people give you a little

1265
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,010
better break on the deal and so it

1266
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:15,869
allowed me to have an incredible price

1267
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:18,030
differential on what I was doing so I

1268
00:51:15,869 --> 00:51:20,519
could play Frankenstein all the time and

1269
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:23,400
ask these questions but no one else I

1270
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:25,230
knew had the funds and I had the funds

1271
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,570
only because I was driving so much

1272
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:30,360
business to the lab that they just said

1273
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:32,430
we'll play with you but for most people

1274
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,200
they don't that's why for these you know

1275
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:35,969
younger breeders that were coming up I

1276
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:38,250
would give them material that I said hey

1277
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:40,079
look we know that this plant throws this

1278
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:41,369
turf profile it throws this

1279
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,429
morphological shape

1280
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:47,759
and it throws this chemo type on the

1281
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:49,919
majority of plants it touches and yes

1282
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,570
there's outliers but overall you'll get

1283
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,010
a population that's easier to sift

1284
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,510
because you'll love more of what you

1285
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,980
like and and the more of what you like

1286
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,610
you'll find the one that's exactly what

1287
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,860
you like

1288
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:01,079
it's the sifting process that's that

1289
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:03,150
it's the demon that's the one where you

1290
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:05,819
have to hold all the plants in redundant

1291
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:08,160
copy and then you have to be able to

1292
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:11,370
actually sit down and standardize your

1293
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,420
testing and be honest about it because

1294
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:15,089
the one thing I've noticed about

1295
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,980
breeding is that if the progeny isn't

1296
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,850
better than the parental stock you

1297
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,070
didn't do anything

1298
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:22,019
but because you made it it's your baby

1299
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:26,039
and the reality is is that you got a

1300
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:28,320
three-headed kid and yeah and as a

1301
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:30,389
breeder like he referred to you earlier

1302
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:33,269
you have to be a you almost have to be a

1303
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:35,730
robot at this time state because you're

1304
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:37,710
creating things that you hold very dear

1305
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:39,630
to you because you've worked on them and

1306
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:42,179
now you're going to release them to

1307
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:44,460
people who are then going to do bad

1308
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:46,289
things to them and so that's tough you

1309
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,179
know so that's something you have to get

1310
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:50,130
overs you got to be able to release your

1311
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:52,349
stuff and be able to stand behind it and

1312
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:54,240
hope that they do well with it and

1313
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:55,710
that's kind of these two guys been

1314
00:52:54,239 --> 00:53:03,059
fighting over two questions so what I'm

1315
00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:06,659
gonna do is take em first and then what

1316
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:09,210
is the biggest reoccurring mistake that

1317
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:14,789
your competitors make that their

1318
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:17,010
performance I think that when it comes

1319
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:19,679
to doing genomics work it's an

1320
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:22,260
assumption that a and B combined will

1321
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:26,009
give you this and the reality is that

1322
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:30,120
often it doesn't it just doesn't match

1323
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:31,620
up and it's it's what I did is I took a

1324
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:33,119
look at all these other forms of

1325
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:36,150
breeding so I look at people who breed

1326
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,609
cattle people who breed dogs people who

1327
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:41,280
read fish and I realize that there's an

1328
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:44,010
intangible genomically that it just is

1329
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,740
and what you have to work with this as

1330
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:50,130
much skill as possible and then some

1331
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:51,899
good fortune and good fortune is a big

1332
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:54,039
one because people always underestimate

1333
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,110
just the truth of

1334
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:58,029
that and and and that's the that's what

1335
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:00,940
makes human being so incredible because

1336
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:02,290
you can crush down a population all you

1337
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,690
want but out of the ghetto comes

1338
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:07,090
somebody who can split an atom because

1339
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:09,700
ultimately in that genetic code pops out

1340
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:11,700
something unbelievable from parents who

1341
00:54:09,699 --> 00:54:14,199
were normal you can get exceptional

1342
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:15,849
somewhere in the line prior they had to

1343
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:18,039
be exceptional but it doesn't have to

1344
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:21,250
come out I use myself as an example of

1345
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:23,769
I'm a good reader male because I don't

1346
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:26,320
really screw up the good woman that I

1347
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:28,840
chose to have kids with so the kids that

1348
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,789
come out are more like their mom than me

1349
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:33,130
all they have for me is their more

1350
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:35,500
stubborn so that's what we notice is

1351
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:36,610
that my kids are stubborn and driven but

1352
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,800
other than that they're more like their

1353
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:40,780
mothers in appearance and in personality

1354
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,220
and so I'm a good reader male because

1355
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:44,080
when you put me on top of it

1356
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:57,579
all I'm adding is some very specific

1357
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:59,019
traits hey you know what I wanted to say

1358
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:00,699
real fast to you before we what we get

1359
00:54:59,019 --> 00:55:03,190
the question but if you notice we've

1360
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:04,929
been having a sign language presentation

1361
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:07,150
you know what happened was a friend of

1362
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:09,009
mine Candida mushroom and he's hiding

1363
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:10,360
somewhere he hits me up and he says Kemp

1364
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:13,360
I have some friends that are farmers in

1365
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,800
Oregon that are hearing impaired and he

1366
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,990
said you know this is something that

1367
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:19,990
needs to be brought into a conversation

1368
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:22,059
because did you know that this many

1369
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:24,129
people in the country or globally are

1370
00:55:22,059 --> 00:55:26,279
hearing impaired and I didn't and I

1371
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:30,280
realized how ignorant I was to that

1372
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,750
situation and so he was like we need to

1373
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,910
do some work so that we can get

1374
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:36,460
cultivation information into the hands

1375
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:38,049
of the people that are hearing impaired

1376
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:40,900
because they have to build the

1377
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:43,269
vocabulary to explain what you're doing

1378
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:45,789
and I said hey we're doing this

1379
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:47,380
incredible regen event filled with

1380
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:49,900
really kill of people breaking out

1381
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:51,940
incredible information maybe we can work

1382
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:54,639
it out and Josh was gracious enough to

1383
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:56,220
say hey I would love to have that and so

1384
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:59,589
what we have is we have people that are

1385
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:01,799
signing so that we can record it so that

1386
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:05,890
we can share it because fundamentally

1387
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,269
it's it's it's the world we're in really

1388
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:08,739
a cannabis is inclusive

1389
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:12,690
so I just wanted to say thank you so

1390
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:12,689
much for taking the time to come

1391
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,239
[Applause]

1392
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:38,780
explain the language barrier no doubt I

1393
00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:40,730
just wanted to bring some attention

1394
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:43,039
because it's like what's going on and

1395
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,690
what it is is that you have this massive

1396
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:46,700
global population you can call today

1397
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:50,659
cannabis cannabis to me was always the

1398
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:53,239
most inclusive world and to be able to

1399
00:56:50,659 --> 00:56:56,210
be tying more people into what we do is

1400
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:57,949
beautiful and the individuals were

1401
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:59,809
lovely individuals and their cannabis

1402
00:56:57,949 --> 00:57:02,358
farmers too so it allows them to be able

1403
00:56:59,809 --> 00:57:04,548
to have an ability to understand the

1404
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:08,269
material and find a way to translate

1405
00:57:04,548 --> 00:57:31,449
words that aren't translated yet and so

1406
00:57:08,269 --> 00:57:31,449
that's what's going on you know I think

1407
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,990
personally okay the question is is what

1408
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,730
one of my competitors what's their

1409
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:39,739
biggest mistake that they're making

1410
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:42,798
right now and that's kind of a two part

1411
00:57:39,739 --> 00:57:44,929
that's two parts for me personally I've

1412
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:46,730
made this mistake over the last two

1413
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:49,818
years and I'm just now getting a hold of

1414
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:51,858
it is not being aggressive in your

1415
00:57:49,818 --> 00:57:55,038
marketing and your social media and

1416
00:57:51,858 --> 00:57:56,869
getting your name out there I'm I'm old

1417
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:57,770
school so it's been real tough for me to

1418
00:57:56,869 --> 00:57:59,869
get out there and want to feel

1419
00:57:57,769 --> 00:58:01,579
comfortable talking to people and I

1420
00:57:59,869 --> 00:58:03,740
wasn't aggressive enough to get a

1421
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:07,010
website and get out there and really do

1422
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:08,808
a lot of events like this that's a big

1423
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:10,460
problem now because if you're not

1424
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:12,798
getting out there and they're not seeing

1425
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:15,740
you and they don't know who you are you

1426
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:18,739
are not going to make it because this is

1427
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:21,500
a new new age of society where they want

1428
00:58:18,739 --> 00:58:23,538
to be they want you to be there you know

1429
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,608
it's Kardashian thing you know you got

1430
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:27,319
to be able to to show your friends look

1431
00:58:25,608 --> 00:58:30,409
I got this and I got it from him and

1432
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:33,469
then that brings it in the other part

1433
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:35,480
is hyping up something too much and

1434
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:37,730
releasing it too soon without knowing

1435
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,559
what you've got and then it screws you

1436
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:41,630
later on down the road because all of a

1437
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:43,460
sudden you've got a hundred farmers that

1438
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:45,858
are pissed off because they spent six

1439
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,389
months of their time on all of a sudden

1440
00:58:45,858 --> 00:58:50,389
they can't do anything with it because

1441
00:58:47,389 --> 00:58:51,949
it didn't work out that and the same

1442
00:58:50,389 --> 00:58:54,078
thing with the social media you got to

1443
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:55,939
be careful don't over hype something and

1444
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,339
make sure that what you release is good

1445
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:00,470
like I said it's a two-year program for

1446
00:58:58,338 --> 00:59:03,739
me because once I make something it's a

1447
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:07,189
whole year of doing deps indoor-outdoor

1448
00:59:03,739 --> 00:59:09,979
full Sun you know shade how did it how

1449
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:12,170
did it go across the board to consumer

1450
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:14,240
like it did the did your vendors buy it

1451
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:15,740
you know there's a lot to it and that's

1452
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:17,659
where people make the mistake is

1453
00:59:15,739 --> 00:59:19,939
overhyping something that's not ready

1454
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:22,368
for the market with with commoditized

1455
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:26,838
crops crops that move globally so that's

1456
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:29,210
corn wheat those does take ten years

1457
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:31,099
it's three years of doing the breeding

1458
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:33,260
and then and then seven years of sifting

1459
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:35,000
the lines and so literally it's a

1460
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:37,609
10-year process to release something

1461
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,159
that's a commoditized component and with

1462
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:41,719
cannabis ten years is a lifetime and so

1463
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,269
you know the thing is you want to get it

1464
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:46,578
to market right now but the people buy

1465
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:48,380
seed stock from any other industry

1466
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:51,470
they're buying a very different type of

1467
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:54,108
seed and so they have expectations of

1468
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:55,308
reliability repeatability and I think

1469
00:59:54,108 --> 00:59:56,960
like what he was saying but see he's

1470
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:58,309
honest so he says listen if he sent

1471
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,420
something out that was untested he just

1472
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:01,160
say look I haven't tested it I put

1473
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:03,230
together some interesting stuff if you

1474
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:04,699
want to buy it this is the cost and then

1475
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:06,318
you can run through and do your tests

1476
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:08,449
but I wouldn't commit my whole crop to

1477
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:11,778
it and then they can find out if it

1478
01:00:08,449 --> 01:00:13,699
works and you know it's important but

1479
01:00:11,778 --> 01:00:15,769
when we really take a look at what

1480
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:17,509
scientific breeding is and how we got to

1481
01:00:15,769 --> 01:00:20,150
where we are with these major crops and

1482
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:23,299
stability the amount of work required to

1483
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:24,920
get there is so huge that it lets you

1484
01:00:23,298 --> 01:00:26,480
realize most of the stuff we're doing is

1485
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,309
just basically throwing darts with our

1486
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:33,159
eyes closed this gentleman right here

1487
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:33,160
before we forget it no no sorry

1488
01:00:35,619 --> 01:01:15,279
I think the chapter first you have to

1489
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,079
ask why is it high B so why so I take a

1490
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,970
look at it and I look like I like touch

1491
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:22,480
- shit all the time and I smoke and I go

1492
01:01:18,969 --> 01:01:24,730
quick quick turn it's gonna hot and it's

1493
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,559
not gonna be hot but when I consume it

1494
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:28,990
and I go whoa that is some good grass I

1495
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:31,539
buy that see now I have something that

1496
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:33,789
that's ii buy cannabis where if I bought

1497
01:01:31,539 --> 01:01:35,980
it once I'd buy it twice and I can start

1498
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:38,619
to say whoa this has a quality that

1499
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:40,599
resonates and if I was to smoke it in

1500
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:42,759
ten years it'd still be good grass

1501
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:44,829
that's what you want to work with in

1502
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,330
your directions and sometimes I don't

1503
01:01:44,829 --> 01:01:48,579
think that the farmer is really

1504
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:51,429
qualified and they hate they hate to say

1505
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:53,949
this but you've got to have somebody who

1506
01:01:51,429 --> 01:01:56,079
can move pounds somebody knows how to

1507
01:01:53,949 --> 01:01:58,419
traffic and they're gonna be honestly

1508
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:01,210
telling you this isn't the right choice

1509
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:02,860
and what they tell you is the one you

1510
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:05,530
have over here that you're not looking

1511
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:08,289
at that's the right choice and so if

1512
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:10,840
your abilities are broad where you have

1513
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:14,139
many skills then you don't need to have

1514
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:16,240
the help but if they're not then don't

1515
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:18,639
be so arrogant that you don't ask for

1516
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:21,789
some help and what it does that lets you

1517
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:23,199
determine what is the trend and why it

1518
01:02:21,789 --> 01:02:24,880
was like when I did the perp when I went

1519
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:26,289
down and sat in the car the bag got

1520
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,030
thrown in the window and I took a look

1521
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:30,190
at it under the streetlight and realized

1522
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:33,430
that the color was clearly defined under

1523
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:35,860
under HDI in a quick turn and that the

1524
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:40,690
blunt didn't change flavor I knew now

1525
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:42,789
why it had value and so I realized it

1526
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,250
was gonna stay in vogue until that

1527
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:46,889
social change

1528
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:49,500
changed but then they took that and they

1529
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:52,170
modified it and the perp is the cherry

1530
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:55,019
pie the cherry pie is the cookie it

1531
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:57,450
didn't go out of vogue you just move the

1532
01:02:55,019 --> 01:03:00,090
current to where it goes by adding

1533
01:02:57,449 --> 01:03:02,339
little things that keep you trendy but

1534
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:04,620
if perp was a monk then it wouldn't

1535
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:06,300
still be current and that's what you

1536
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:07,980
have to take a look at and don't chase

1537
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,960
trends unless you're involved in

1538
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:12,179
Hollywood meaning that you have people

1539
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,179
that are setting the trends and they're

1540
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:17,549
able to let you see we got traction and

1541
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:19,710
then you smoke it and you go that's real

1542
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:21,390
now you can run it because you need at

1543
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:22,740
least two years when I release varieties

1544
01:03:21,389 --> 01:03:24,779
in kelowna form I want to see at least a

1545
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:26,879
two year little egg span where you can

1546
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:29,730
run it this year and get paid next year

1547
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,430
you get paid and on the third year you

1548
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:33,750
can get paid but it's not red-hot

1549
01:03:31,429 --> 01:03:35,969
because everyone's gonna pour into the

1550
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:38,699
market and fill it so two year three

1551
01:03:35,969 --> 01:03:40,199
three years a dream oh gee is like a

1552
01:03:38,699 --> 01:03:41,489
legend where if you had the same Cup for

1553
01:03:40,199 --> 01:04:02,519
the last 15 years you would've got paid

1554
01:03:41,489 --> 01:04:04,439
but now has to be spicy I agree it's

1555
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:06,750
just that what's gonna happen is it's

1556
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,970
gonna it's gonna change into which

1557
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:10,170
gelato which which subtlety it's kind of

1558
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:12,389
like looking at wedding cake and

1559
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:15,750
birthday cake so wedding cake yields

1560
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:17,909
better and it gives you better color but

1561
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:20,550
if you consume it next to birthday cake

1562
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:22,049
it's not as satisfactory and so the

1563
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:24,630
thing is you have to be able to say okay

1564
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:26,850
why do they like it I got the gelato 41

1565
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:29,039
right so the 41 has this incredible

1566
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:30,900
cherry pie on top of that that flavor

1567
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,360
profile that lasts in the joint it's

1568
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:36,000
gorgeous but the thing is if you go only

1569
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:38,340
that route what we noticed is Fusarium

1570
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,099
prone and so all of a sudden now your

1571
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:44,519
whole library is prone to pathogenic

1572
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:47,250
pressure so maybe 15% of your line

1573
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:48,539
becomes gelato or gelato hybrids and

1574
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,190
you've used them for years and had

1575
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:51,769
success and people know when they come

1576
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:54,269
to you that they can get those things

1577
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:55,409
but you start weighing everything heavy

1578
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:59,028
that one way

1579
01:04:55,409 --> 01:05:08,009
oh you got a problem that goes south

1580
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:09,000
welcome that that depends on the project

1581
01:05:08,009 --> 01:05:10,710
that I'm working on

1582
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,329
depends on whether we're doing open

1583
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:15,389
pollination or where I'm doing something

1584
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:17,039
specific that that's that's generalized

1585
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:19,548
and if I'm doing open pollination I'm

1586
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,839
usually losing at least three males

1587
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:23,699
depending on how many pills I'm using

1588
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,170
but yeah what'd he say an open

1589
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:27,000
pollination meaning like when you land

1590
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:28,588
pollen onto the plant are you allowing

1591
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,179
the male and the female to naturally

1592
01:05:28,588 --> 01:05:33,268
pollinate themselves are you directing

1593
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:36,419
the pollen okay for me I like to collect

1594
01:05:33,268 --> 01:05:38,608
a pond and then I use it as needed with

1595
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:41,278
a brush or I'm taking it out there and

1596
01:05:38,608 --> 01:05:43,650
I'll have a paper bag put my butt in it

1597
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:46,679
make sure you shake it yeah now I also

1598
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:48,660
do direct open pollination in the

1599
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:49,588
greenhouses where the males are in there

1600
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:51,929
with the females

1601
01:05:49,588 --> 01:05:53,460
the fans are blowing and they'll be in

1602
01:05:51,929 --> 01:05:55,679
there for a couple days to make sure I'm

1603
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:58,409
getting a full complete thing but if I'm

1604
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:00,268
doing specific breeding in the in the

1605
01:05:58,409 --> 01:06:02,518
garden and I don't want to contaminate

1606
01:06:00,268 --> 01:06:05,459
everything yeah take it in a jar take a

1607
01:06:02,518 --> 01:06:07,318
brush brush go out there you can

1608
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:10,588
actually now get sleeves that you can

1609
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:12,298
put around your plant that's a mesh you

1610
01:06:10,588 --> 01:06:13,768
can inject your pollen right into a

1611
01:06:12,298 --> 01:06:15,420
little thing it drops it right in there

1612
01:06:13,768 --> 01:06:17,909
you seal it off and it's not going to

1613
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:19,139
affect the rest of your plants so yeah

1614
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:25,558
it depends on what the program you're

1615
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:29,159
doing on I would be using the mid

1616
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:31,700
branches normally the whole plant

1617
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:34,288
because I'm I'm breeding for everything

1618
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:35,639
two years ago when I was with the Mendo

1619
01:06:34,289 --> 01:06:38,278
hideout we were just doing branch

1620
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:40,048
specifics on lower branches because we

1621
01:06:38,278 --> 01:06:43,048
were trying to maintain the rest of the

1622
01:06:40,048 --> 01:06:45,568
flower for production so how deep into

1623
01:06:43,048 --> 01:06:46,798
the cycle you go like you know this is

1624
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:48,449
going to depend on your varietals

1625
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,909
because all of them have a different

1626
01:06:48,449 --> 01:06:53,338
flowering period so if they produce an

1627
01:06:50,909 --> 01:06:54,929
abundance of pollen receptor sites early

1628
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:56,639
that's when you need to hit them right

1629
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:58,618
if you don't see that happen and so say

1630
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:00,598
between 21 to 25 so I like a little

1631
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:02,480
sweet spot but if you're going to go

1632
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:05,030
into something that might finish it at 9

1633
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:08,030
days then lo and behold there's no sites

1634
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:09,740
at 28 days it's still in a transitional

1635
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:11,660
vegetative stage so you have to

1636
01:07:09,739 --> 01:07:13,849
basically choose your pollination times

1637
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:16,190
for the varietals that you're using and

1638
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:18,618
that's trial and error and that's your

1639
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:20,780
R&amp;D and then what you do is you record

1640
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:23,269
it and so that you know hey when I

1641
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:26,090
pollinate it at this time this way

1642
01:07:23,269 --> 01:07:28,699
I only received this much seed mass per

1643
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:32,119
square foot and it gives you a really

1644
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:35,179
clear idea of what's the efficiency of

1645
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:36,260
your pollination and that matters and

1646
01:07:35,179 --> 01:07:38,210
people like I only want a couple but the

1647
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:40,580
thing about is it if you copy how they

1648
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:43,309
do it commercially then it'll lets you

1649
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:44,599
use someone else's brain you know it's

1650
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,920
it's better not to learn through a

1651
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:47,239
mistake it's better to let someone else

1652
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:52,400
fuckup in you learn through their

1653
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:53,719
mistake it's painful and just admit it

1654
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,670
though don't be afraid to admit it you

1655
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:57,679
know don't steal the credit that's my

1656
01:07:55,670 --> 01:08:00,590
whole thing with readers is that they

1657
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:02,739
always get screwed because most of them

1658
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:07,550
are so passionate about the work that

1659
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:10,250
they don't chase the protection the best

1660
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:12,890
example I have a brand protection is

1661
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:14,929
Michael buffer and Michael buffer come

1662
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:15,559
up with one phrase let's get ready to

1663
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:17,259
rumble

1664
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:20,210
do you know how much that phrases worth

1665
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:21,859
half a billion dollars and you know why

1666
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:23,989
it's worth half a billion because he

1667
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:26,088
sends a team of lawyers to beat you to

1668
01:08:23,988 --> 01:08:28,399
death if he finds out you're using it

1669
01:08:26,088 --> 01:08:32,568
and what it does it lets him proprietary

1670
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:34,759
own that phrase breeders rely on people

1671
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:38,080
like us farmers growers nursery

1672
01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:40,189
operators store operators to be

1673
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:42,439
conscientious of the fact that they put

1674
01:08:40,189 --> 01:08:44,719
all the work in and so instead of me

1675
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:47,689
taking his work and then re labeling it

1676
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:50,810
myself I make sure I give credit to him

1677
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:53,000
and and push it and then what it does it

1678
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:55,160
lets him do the work he's supposed to so

1679
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,759
I'm riding on his coattails but I'm not

1680
01:08:55,159 --> 01:08:59,930
stealing his coal thank you so I tried

1681
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:03,118
man I tried you know

1682
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:03,119
[Applause]

1683
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:10,579
there's this one guys been trying to get

1684
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,910
a question forever okay one more

1685
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:19,699
question

1686
01:09:10,909 --> 01:09:22,250
oh crap you know pollinate crap yeah so

1687
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:24,559
at a general level because I'm just a

1688
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:27,250
regular farmer I like coconut water or

1689
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:31,420
hydrogen peroxide and I'll soak them

1690
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:34,100
Kevin has a whole way more intense

1691
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:36,140
laboratory procedure he can explain to

1692
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:38,000
you but for me I'll think they're soaked

1693
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:40,640
them in coconut water and then they go

1694
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,710
in the ground yeah I use regular real

1695
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,480
coconut water because that coconut is

1696
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:47,810
that life juice that's in that coconut

1697
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:49,489
is see that's to get that seat going it

1698
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:51,530
works amazing I'll soak them in coconut

1699
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:53,899
water then they'll go into either paper

1700
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:55,429
towels and wait so check my germination

1701
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:58,939
rates or they'll go straight into the

1702
01:09:55,430 --> 01:10:01,730
soil blocks there's hydrogen peroxide

1703
01:09:58,939 --> 01:10:03,859
you can use the regular store-bought

1704
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:07,039
hydrogen peroxide but it's not quite as

1705
01:10:03,859 --> 01:10:09,079
great as that they concentrated quick

1706
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:11,630
little roll around in them and then back

1707
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:14,779
in yeah and and then they'll go into

1708
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:17,449
purified water packs with paper towels

1709
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:20,259
or into our soil box but kevin has a

1710
01:10:17,449 --> 01:10:24,319
whole intense way of being able to do it

1711
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:27,380
a lot of it is does the seed have the

1712
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:30,170
ability to break through the husk and so

1713
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:32,630
you can mechanically crack it and you

1714
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:34,460
can also sometimes scarify it to make it

1715
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:36,440
so that it can be the liquid can imbibe

1716
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:39,170
easier because sometimes you get a skin

1717
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:41,000
on the seed that's very resistant and so

1718
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:43,039
what I do is I make these containers

1719
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,140
where I glue sandpaper inside the

1720
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:47,359
container and then I can just shake the

1721
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:49,730
seed and scarify it and then once I've

1722
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:52,489
scarified it now I have the ability to

1723
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:54,979
get liquid to penetrate easier and then

1724
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:56,569
I'd want to it depends on just how old

1725
01:10:54,979 --> 01:10:59,089
this is but if I can use an h2o to

1726
01:10:56,569 --> 01:11:01,639
solution what it does it allows me to be

1727
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:03,920
able to get a form of oxygen driven into

1728
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,890
it so that I start to have this this

1729
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:10,279
metabolic process move forward and I can

1730
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:11,869
also use stuff like grow Kashi in a

1731
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:12,479
liquid form because what I'm doing is

1732
01:11:11,869 --> 01:11:14,489
I'm getting

1733
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:18,329
but I call buyer protectants I use that

1734
01:11:14,489 --> 01:11:21,210
on TC plants to where if I can give the

1735
01:11:18,329 --> 01:11:23,340
plant a bio protective form it allows

1736
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:26,100
this to imbibe and it allows it to

1737
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:29,430
instantly have the buyer protectants

1738
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:31,350
needed to survive as a child because a

1739
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:35,159
lot of the stock that's tough to crack

1740
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:36,810
is typically a little weaker in general

1741
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:38,399
and so I want to give it everything

1742
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:41,550
possible so I don't need to go through

1743
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:43,170
300 seeds to get 50 out and what you're

1744
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:45,270
gonna find is some plants just do that

1745
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:47,130
those aren't the ones you you work with

1746
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:49,290
in that form it's like the clone ability

1747
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:51,270
when I'm looking for cultivars that I

1748
01:11:49,289 --> 01:11:54,060
want to work on a nursery level if it

1749
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:55,530
doesn't clone I can't use it so I've had

1750
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:58,410
plants that you couldn't strike roots

1751
01:11:55,529 --> 01:12:00,210
for 30 days that makes it impossible to

1752
01:11:58,409 --> 01:12:01,829
put into a clonal operation and that's

1753
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:03,539
what maybe understand how many killer

1754
01:12:01,829 --> 01:12:06,359
varieties we've lost because they're so

1755
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:10,260
hard to propagate it's just the reality

1756
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:11,069
you know and so I think I think that was

1757
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:16,039
the last question

1758
01:12:11,069 --> 01:12:16,039
right thank you

1759
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:23,239
and thank you Eric from HP cave in

1760
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:23,239
always a privilege thank you

1761
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:42,988
