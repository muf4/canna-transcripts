2
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:15,539
when when working with plants though

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,460
just talking about working in the size

4
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:22,739
of the plant you have watering how you

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,730
deliver the water to the plant is

6
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:30,570
critical in how it grows my personally I

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,509
mean personally I think that the more

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,960
often you water small doses the better

9
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:38,699
off your plant is going to be it takes a

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,870
little bit of working exactly what a

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,710
small dose is I've often worked with

12
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:50,519
6070 mils per watering if you deliver

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,378
that water on a regular basis the amount

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,059
of water that the plant sees the amount

15
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:55,948
of nutrient that the plant sees and the

16
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,679
amount of air that the plant sees at any

17
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:01,108
instance is much more uniform throughout

18
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,350
the whole day so that that plant then

19
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,109
should be in an optimum growing

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:10,769
environment more often or a larger

21
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:12,599
portion of each day so I look at at

22
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,179
watering first thing in the morning

23
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:17,728
maybe half an hour after the lights are

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,970
turned on or the Sun comes up giving the

25
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:24,239
plant its first water and then maybe an

26
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:26,938
hour or so after that and then as you

27
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,188
get more toward the heat of the day you

28
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:31,019
may get down to a half an hour between

29
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:33,629
waterings you really have to work with

30
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,938
what plants you have and then the

31
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:38,129
environment you have if the air is drier

32
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,199
around you if you have a wind moving

33
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:43,259
through all these things are going to

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,700
increase the amount of water that your

35
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:50,700
plant needs you're gonna have to adjust

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,200
your watering program to do that also

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,750
believe that in the end of the day you

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,000
should be stopping your water two hours

39
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,328
before the lights and I say two hours

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,879
it's not like two hours it's two three

41
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,728
hours before the lights go off so that

42
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,228
the roots are drier going through the

43
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:09,330
dark period of time during the dark

44
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,520
period they do not use as much water and

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,650
if they're going to be if there's a lot

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,950
of water setting around you increase the

47
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,129
past

48
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:22,560
abilities of root problems root rot

49
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:24,030
setting in to to give your plants some

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,719
difficulty in that way

51
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,689
this type of watering system works well

52
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,959
in any kind of a growing media where you

53
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:39,389
have enough drainage or where you're not

54
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:42,569
going to be having the the the media too

55
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:44,250
wet if you're growing in soil and you're

56
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:46,798
in it's getting too wet go in with that

57
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,680
you still need you still should be

58
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:52,950
watering a number of times smaller

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,129
bursts it just maybe cannot get quite so

60
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:58,679
close together one of the things you'll

61
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:01,799
find out in delivery of water is that if

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,569
you're dripping or dripping water the

63
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,959
slower you drip the water into your

64
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:09,598
growing media in a drop hits and spread

65
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,610
sideways if the drips are coming too

66
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,259
close or it's just a small stream coming

67
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,410
into there you're gonna find out that

68
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,239
the water is going to build a certain

69
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,219
amount of weight in a small area in a

70
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,319
centered pot and then it's gonna start

71
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:25,019
going straight down right below the

72
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,149
dripper so you'll end up with a tube

73
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,430
almost you know two-three inches in

74
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,650
diameter going straight down as opposed

75
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,900
to if it's very slow coming in it drips

76
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,539
and it gets the time to move sideways

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,099
and it might be a drip drip drip but

78
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:40,259
ever after every one it gets that little

79
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:44,340
bit of a time to move sideways so it

80
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:47,879
moves across the whole growing a whole

81
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,310
pot level or a whole whole area of the

82
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,000
pot one of the other things that the

83
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:57,689
watering on on a small dose is regular

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,239
is that the your your balance of

85
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:02,729
nutrients and and you're gonna hear a

86
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,370
lot of people talking a lot about oh I

87
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:08,848
feed that a parts per million of twelve

88
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,730
hundred or eighteen as is and it's it's

89
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:15,238
nice to know what that level of nutrient

90
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:17,189
is but what's more important than the

91
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,439
level of nutrient is actually the

92
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:22,759
balance of your nutrients that you had

93
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,529
it's like eating your own for yourself

94
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,699
what you need is a balanced diet the

95
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:29,229
more balanced your diet is you

96
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,089
more important than eating a large

97
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,670
amount or a small amount you're gonna be

98
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:36,219
healthier if if you've got vegetables if

99
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,540
you get protein if you got just there

100
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,040
are all the different food groups that

101
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,750
you need to to to grow well and the

102
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,300
plants are the same thing if you're

103
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,540
feeding them small doses what you're

104
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,199
gonna do is continue to see a reasonably

105
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,210
level balance of nutrients in the same

106
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,819
balance that you're feeding all day long

107
00:04:55,209 --> 00:05:00,310
if what you do is you give them one you

108
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:03,759
know one feed every two days the first

109
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,759
day it's gonna have to be you know way

110
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,430
up over what they need and as time goes

111
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,019
by it's gonna come down come down and

112
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,850
there's gonna be a point in there where

113
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,979
some of your nutrients are probably

114
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:18,610
gonna be have been used up because they

115
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:21,400
don't we don't know exactly how every

116
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,740
plant is going to use every nutrient in

117
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,709
all situations so you get something

118
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,470
that's reasonably well balanced and you

119
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:32,109
feed it and in it's gonna continue to go

120
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,210
down both the level of nutrients and the

121
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,100
balance of the nutrients going to get

122
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:39,089
out until it gets to a point where it's

123
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:42,000
too little you may never see it a

124
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:44,409
deficiency because it might be just slow

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,769
growing through that period of time but

126
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,420
you are going to lose some efficiencies

127
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:52,060
in plant growth it's gonna slow your

128
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,860
whole plant growth down and then when

129
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,750
you you know when you get to the next

130
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,850
feed it goes from down here to up here

131
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,709
again bit of a shock to the plant it's

132
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,720
been struggling to get water been

133
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,949
struggling to get nutrients and all of a

134
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,170
sudden it's got everything it needs

135
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,029
again then it starts to go back to go

136
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,040
back through that same cycle going down

137
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:12,309
again whereas if you can give it at just

138
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,950
a little bit of a dose every hour every

139
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,509
couple hours and I'm sure there's gonna

140
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,360
be any number of people that say 12

141
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:22,480
times a day how the heck can I do that

142
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:26,770
not so hard you it's it takes a timer

143
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:30,310
and and a valve and timer turns a pump

144
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:32,409
on or a timer turns a a solenoid valve

145
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,149
on and lets water go out to there and it

146
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,420
can be just a few minutes and then off

147
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:39,819
and then when the next time comes around

148
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,210
doing it again and you get a much more

149
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:44,889
even

150
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:46,810
supply of nutrients and air and water to

151
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,030
your root system you should see an

152
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,668
increase in growth so I think the other

153
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:55,179
thing related to the case for frequent

154
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:59,560
feedings at small amounts is you're also

155
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,629
keeping the moisture level consistent so

156
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,269
that the beneficial microbes that thrive

157
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,399
like they're not getting too dry and

158
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:08,829
dying out and then getting too wet and

159
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,409
having anaerobic activity or whatever it

160
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:13,810
may be used to can you just talk about

161
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:17,139
beneficial microbes and that sweet spot

162
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:20,519
and why constant feeding keeps it sort

163
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:23,918
of in that narrow band yep yep okay

164
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:27,339
besides the root needing a constant

165
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:31,329
supply of nutrients and moisture you

166
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:33,728
have a whole ecology in there where you

167
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:36,969
have all kinds of beneficial microbes

168
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:39,939
and bacteria and things growing that our

169
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:44,530
plant beneficial to the root system this

170
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:47,098
keeping a level of moisture and feed for

171
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:52,538
your plant roots also benefits these

172
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:55,149
growing microorganisms which grow in in

173
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:57,098
symbiosis with your root system to help

174
00:07:55,149 --> 00:08:14,620
the whole plant grow and increase in

175
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:16,538
growth okay over the top again to the

176
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,680
microbes and other beneficial bacteria

177
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:24,819
that grow in your in your media a lot

178
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,069
have grown along with root systems over

179
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:29,889
many years and they have grown

180
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:33,099
accustomed to the same level of moisture

181
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:35,469
to be growing around growing that your

182
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:38,860
rich system has and so they as you're

183
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:40,899
providing that level of moisture that is

184
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,278
beneficial for your root system you're

185
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:46,839
going to see that same thing is

186
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:48,669
beneficial for your micro bacteria where

187
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,130
if you're watering again once a day

188
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:53,500
you're gonna see your soil get too wet

189
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:55,600
and you're gonna see your soil get too

190
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,120
dry and it's going to be too

191
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,540
and to dry for your microbes and

192
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,149
beneficial bacteria in there also so

193
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:06,309
they'll go through a period of growing

194
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:09,129
in that sweet spot and then getting up

195
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:10,929
to a place where it's too wet and again

196
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:13,269
it comes back to that too wet no it's

197
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:15,370
actually not enough air and going back

198
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:16,870
through that sweet spot back down to the

199
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:20,500
bottom and it's gonna get too dry down

200
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:22,810
there and that and when I say too dry I

201
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,669
don't mean too much area it's that at

202
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:27,909
that point it actually probably gets to

203
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:31,569
me not enough moisture which may be

204
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:35,259
either too much salt or the coz EC is a

205
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,790
function of moisture if it's if you've

206
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:38,620
got a certain amount of water and a

207
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:41,980
certain amount of salt if you lessen the

208
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,320
water the EC or the salt content or salt

209
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,250
concentration goes up so you get down

210
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:52,930
below that sweet spot of growing for the

211
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,009
bacteria then the they'll die and then I

212
00:09:52,929 --> 00:10:06,959
have to start over

213
00:09:54,009 --> 00:10:06,960
