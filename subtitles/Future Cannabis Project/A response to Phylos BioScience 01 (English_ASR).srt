1
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:16,649
we were talking about within the

2
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,589
cooperative

3
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:23,009
value of working with genetics they're

4
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:25,800
being bred on small farms because of our

5
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:28,050
roots into the culture and how a lot of

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,939
people coming into the industry you know

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,289
they don't they don't have access to

8
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,469
that so what they're gonna be having

9
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,109
more of is more of those you know Sour

10
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,539
Diesel is all the desert flavors all you

11
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,329
know all of this and it's really gonna

12
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:46,198
be challenging as a small craft farmer

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,570
to compete with their operation costs

14
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:50,429
their efficiencies at scale and what

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,039
they're able to bring them to the market

16
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:58,048
and of course as a small farming we have

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,939
the capability of growing a product

18
00:00:58,048 --> 00:01:02,579
that's more high-quality because it's at

19
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:06,269
small scale but when it's just in a jar

20
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,298
in a glass case at a dispensary all

21
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:13,649
people are looking at is the jar and the

22
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,930
THC and the price and so really again it

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,240
all brings it back to the ability to you

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,340
know have a story tell that story and

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,399
convey that to the to the consumer so

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,930
yeah anyway welcome I'm really glad you

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,870
made the trip up and I'd love to hear

28
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,290
what you have to say cool Thank You Man

29
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:34,859
I appreciate it yeah I've been thinking

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,090
about a lot of these things really ever

31
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,030
since I met BAM

32
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,070
I'm sitting in for bam and bam and I met

33
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,370
each other about four or five years ago

34
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:47,059
at a genetics conference after he posted

35
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,530
something on Instagram talking about

36
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,560
applied genomics in the cannabis space

37
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,978
and so the two of us got together we

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,829
went to the program we study applied

39
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:01,679
genomics pretty much from 2015

40
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,719
onward together you know interacting

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,159
through Instagram and through different

42
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,469
social media networks and at that time

43
00:02:08,158 --> 00:02:13,408
we kind of saw what was going on and we

44
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:15,900
wanted to preserve and maintain what we

45
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:19,679
had because we knew what was coming

46
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,300
we knew that big a great interest story

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,010
was going to be coming in

48
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,430
going to move into this space and we

49
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:28,109
know what they've done historically to

50
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,750
every other crop and to every other

51
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,660
small farming industry that has ever

52
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,539
existed we that is a great chart the

53
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:39,270
chart that was posted announcing we

54
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:41,909
coming to this event it really shows the

55
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,520
impact that that model has on genetic

56
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:47,900
diversity and that genetic diversity is

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,500
directly correlated to cultural

58
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:54,659
complexes it's specific regional

59
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:59,550
place-based cultures that develop things

60
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:01,770
that are specifically adapted to their

61
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,290
environments and that's what gets lost

62
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,890
in the big Agri industry model and

63
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:10,709
that's what if that takes over and that

64
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,629
becomes just ubiquitous and the only

65
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,879
thing that we have in cannabis and that

66
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,590
means all of us are gone and that means

67
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,500
that all of the heirloom varieties that

68
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,780
we all loved and cherished and all the

69
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,599
culture and everything that we've built

70
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,659
for the last thirty years forty years

71
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,969
that people have been you know engaging

72
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,620
in this activity in the Americas as we

73
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:33,959
kind of like since the hippies and

74
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,879
everybody started smoking we've really

75
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,890
kind of found this thing again we are

76
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:42,659
absolutely in a point right now where we

77
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,829
could lose all of that and there are

78
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:49,020
large capitalized forces that are

79
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,870
designed specifically with that goal and

80
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,790
that objective in mind and it's through

81
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,739
events like this and through coming

82
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:57,810
together and building resilience and

83
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,469
cultural competency that we're going to

84
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,959
be able to actually resist that the main

85
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:09,209
reason I'm here today is because of what

86
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:11,640
happened on the Internet so a couple

87
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,349
weeks ago Philo's bioscience announced

88
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,599
that they were going to be entering into

89
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:18,750
the breathing space if anybody doesn't

90
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,949
know who Philo's Biosciences please go

91
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:26,569
onto my Instagram sun-grown mids go on

92
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:30,389
to youtube search philo bioscience

93
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:33,300
presentation there is a presentation

94
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:36,899
that was presented by Mowgli Holmes

95
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,329
investors large agribusiness investors

96
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:41,848
the Monsanto's the Syngenta's the doubt

97
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:42,839
accounts of the world and in this

98
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:46,259
presentation

99
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,839
Philo's who has been collecting genetic

100
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,030
samples from the community for the last

101
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,878
four years entering them into a large

102
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:56,818
genomic galaxy and essentially

103
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:59,009
sequencing all of our data in this

104
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:01,470
investors conference Mowgli told the

105
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:04,530
investors the following all cannabis

106
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,509
here today basically sucks it will be

107
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:09,059
replaced in the next couple of years by

108
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:10,468
optimized varietals Philo's will be

109
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,389
creating these varietals

110
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:14,310
and according to magalie they have a

111
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:16,139
number of competitive advantages that

112
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,019
will preclude anyone else from entering

113
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,370
into the cannabis breeding space

114
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:22,680
specifically their genomic data derived

115
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,389
from the testing business as well as a

116
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,918
tissue culture operation which will

117
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:28,110
allow them to scale and gain market

118
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,120
share more rapidly than any of their

119
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,389
competitors or any of our traditional

120
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,459
cannabis cultivators Philo's is

121
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,889
competitive advantage will be so great

122
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:44,098
according to Bob Lee that growing their

123
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:47,879
plants won't be optional 3 in addition

124
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:49,829
to this this is all being done with the

125
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,629
endgame in intent for Philo's to

126
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:53,848
position themselves to be an attractive

127
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:55,560
acquisition for the big 4 agricultural

128
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:57,240
companies or to attract enough

129
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,490
investment to scale up and become

130
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,129
themselves the fifth big agricultural

131
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,500
company he specifically names members of

132
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:07,229
the advisory board with links to do Dow

133
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,560
DuPont Syngenta as well as executives

134
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:14,120
with experience in corporate exits their

135
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,610
plan has always been to take our data

136
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:22,348
use the data to then put it into applied

137
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:25,259
genomics and take all existing plant

138
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:29,069
material and genetic resources to

139
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,229
develop their own optimized varietals

140
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:34,229
what that basically means is high

141
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:39,000
yielding pest resistant they're claiming

142
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:41,399
varieties that are designed and created

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,910
through selective pressures that are not

144
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:47,470
based on genetic diversity on

145
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,320
these particular traits and qualities

146
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:53,050
that we have developed in our specific

147
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,569
local regions that we've been

148
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:59,550
cultivating for decades instead their

149
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:02,709
model is one of absolute uniformity and

150
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,509
maximization of the production that's

151
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:07,989
all they care about it's all about

152
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:09,969
market share and the margins that

153
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,790
they're able to make off of the crop

154
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,580
that's all that matters and that model

155
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,830
has historically produced the results

156
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:20,620
that we've seen in every other industry

157
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:25,139
particularly the grain industry but

158
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:29,280
specifically every crop 75% of it is

159
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:32,649
controlled by the four main agricultural

160
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,599
industries and to the extent that there

161
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:36,549
are some anomalies where about 25

162
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,189
percent of market share is represented

163
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:43,120
by traditional heirloom cultivators and

164
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:45,279
small cultivators those are rare far and

165
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,220
few between and the only reason those

166
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,019
exist is because people got together

167
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,880
organize and actually preserve their

168
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:54,819
cultural legacy and their genetic

169
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:57,310
resources failure to do so what really

170
00:07:54,819 --> 00:08:00,370
means extinction that's what we're toast

171
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,350
with right now and so that's why we need

172
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,780
to get organized and we need to get back

173
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:08,320
to our roots we need to remember how we

174
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:10,239
came here and how we preserved all of

175
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,610
these plants and created all this

176
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,540
diversity and the beauty that we love in

177
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,280
this plant the cultural traditions and

178
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:21,939
everything that has brought us together

179
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:24,219
is what we're seeking to preserve and we

180
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:27,129
need to go back and remember those

181
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,260
dynamics specifically right now what's

182
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:32,168
going on is that legalization has been

183
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:34,299
an incredibly disorienting effect people

184
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:36,038
are scared they're backwards

185
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,679
bureaucracies we have to interact with

186
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:40,479
supply chains and markets that maximize

187
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,718
inefficiencies as opposed to

188
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,270
efficiencies that this is causing

189
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,160
anxiety and forcing people into forced

190
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:51,340
decisions and compromises and even the

191
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,259
best circumstances and more than that

192
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,990
we're facing capitalized operations with

193
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:57,049
business plans that are specifically to

194
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,789
sell below the cost

195
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:01,399
production to drive down costs and

196
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:04,099
eliminate their competition that means

197
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,440
eliminating us so we have to build

198
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,180
resilience and we have to survive we

199
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,529
have to make it through these next few

200
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:16,009
years to even have anything to look

201
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:17,600
forward to in the cannabis space it's

202
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,129
moments like this that we need to rely

203
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,959
on our culture and our traditions to

204
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:22,909
cultivate the reliance necessary to

205
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,949
confront these conditions we need to get

206
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,289
back to our roots remember that we have

207
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,640
always been adaptive and resilient we

208
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:31,278
need to remember that it was always

209
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,470
about over growing the system we have a

210
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,240
responsibility to take leadership for

211
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,759
preserving and adapting our culture and

212
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,649
traditions to the current context this

213
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,720
is our culture these are our traditions

214
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,519
that have brought us together if we take

215
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,490
leadership and accountability for them

216
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,278
now we will create the resilience that

217
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,230
we need to survive everything we've done

218
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,389
historically is what needs to be done

219
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,190
now we've already done this before we

220
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,139
figured out how to grow hundreds of

221
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,690
pounds off of six plants when they

222
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:02,389
imposed six plant limits like we can

223
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,750
figure out to do incredible things in

224
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:07,250
very confined spaces because we're

225
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,879
adaptive and resilient people and we

226
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,470
just need to remember that not allow the

227
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:15,559
disorienting fear-based

228
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:18,290
zero-sum sort of dynamics that is being

229
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,179
imposed upon us to take over and allow

230
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:25,039
us to forget who we are and lose

231
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:27,078
ourselves in this process a key part of

232
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,769
this is education these events sorryi

233
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:32,958
not great with mics these events are

234
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:34,730
absolutely vital this is how we learn

235
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,278
how we find each other build permanent

236
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,750
recurring opportunities to elaborate and

237
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,610
strengthen our cultural bonds and

238
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,679
traditions we're all becoming forced to

239
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,139
become experts on the fly everything

240
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,958
from business to supply chain management

241
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:49,669
to a whole host of things that a lot of

242
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,889
people who started out because they

243
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:54,019
loved pot wanted to grow plant that was

244
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:56,569
illegal never thought they were going to

245
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:58,310
be getting into but we've all had to

246
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,199
become experts we've had to become legal

247
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:01,939
experts we've had to become regulatory

248
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:03,740
experts we've had to become economic

249
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:08,270
experts we've had to become

250
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:10,009
and that's just rising to the moment

251
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:13,639
that's what we've always done and that's

252
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:18,259
what we'll continue to do additionally

253
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:22,189
we're being forced one of the primary

254
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:26,059
issues that were being confronted with

255
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:28,700
right now is an issue of scientific

256
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:30,799
illiteracy there are a lot of people who

257
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,960
are very smart who were inspired to come

258
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,819
and get involved in cannabis and those

259
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,210
individuals are people that we need to

260
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,730
look to you now the people who actually

261
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:42,259
understand science and who have been

262
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:46,730
engaged in the sciences in their

263
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:48,500
everyday lives but also love cannabis we

264
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,870
need to find those people we need to

265
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,360
bring them into these spaces we need to

266
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,519
encourage them to become leaders in the

267
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,279
cannabis space because we need them now

268
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,669
more than ever we need to develop our

269
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:06,139
own cultural literacy and scientific

270
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:07,939
literacy specifically one of the reasons

271
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,590
why violence was able to do what they

272
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,390
were able to do is because people

273
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,269
honestly don't understand the technology

274
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:19,159
and they don't understand the science

275
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:21,110
around it we needed to be mystify plant

276
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,949
breeding this is one of the primary

277
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:28,430
tasks that we have as a community plant

278
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:31,610
breeding seems like wizardry it seems

279
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:36,159
incredibly complicated but it's not it's

280
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:39,139
a very simple process of observing and

281
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:42,289
engaging with your plant that's all it

282
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:44,809
really is and selecting for things that

283
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:46,789
you find desirable across time that's

284
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:49,339
all we're doing here we need to

285
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:53,809
encourage people just to get out there

286
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:56,180
and do it do not sit back and think oh I

287
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:58,159
don't have breeding stock or I don't

288
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:00,049
actually know how to do breathing or

289
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:03,949
that's what those other people do

290
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:05,779
experts do we all can breed cannabis and

291
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,000
most of the cannabis that was bred

292
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:10,579
throughout all of history was bred by

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,399
people who didn't have PhDs and didn't

294
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,980
have sign

295
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,769
backgrounds but just instead selected

296
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,250
for traits that they found desirable and

297
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:22,019
had cultural complexes that selected for

298
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,750
those traits and we can look through

299
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:27,360
Central Asia and the cultural complex

300
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,190
that arose around cannabis there and how

301
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,278
that had impacts on the genetic

302
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,520
resources and why Afghan plants are

303
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:38,490
morphologically and chemically the way

304
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,850
that they are well why South Indian and

305
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,860
South Asian and African strains are the

306
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,950
way that they are that's because they

307
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,930
were in specific cultural complexes they

308
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,660
were isolated over time and people

309
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:55,949
selected for traits that they valued so

310
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:58,679
in South Africa in South India South

311
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:03,089
Asia Southeast Asia they were selecting

312
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:05,129
for high THC flowers in the Central Asia

313
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:07,950
and Afghanistan in the Middle East they

314
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:10,080
were selecting for hashish and we can

315
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,089
see the actual impacts of those

316
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,700
selective pressures and those cultures

317
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:18,480
had on the plant thousands of years

318
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:21,209
later and we've inherited that tradition

319
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,019
and those cultural resources now and

320
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:25,229
it's upon us to make sure that down the

321
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,449
line

322
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,909
hundreds of years from now thousands of

323
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:32,640
years from now people don't look back on

324
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:33,569
us at this time in this place is having

325
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,269
fucked it all up

326
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,330
that's really what what's going on right

327
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:38,329
now

328
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,159
you
