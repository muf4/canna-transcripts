00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:25,710
my name is Julie crocodile G I'm the

3
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,060
director of compliance and I am here to

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:34,859
moderate this panel discussion on track

5
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:37,229
and trace metric track and trace I will

6
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,939
say upfront that I'm sure I'm near

7
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:40,949
confident we're gonna come out of this

8
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,140
panel with more questions than answers

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,070
about track and trace just so you know

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,009
because it is a giant question mark for

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,719
the entire industry right now when is it

12
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:56,640
gonna start what's happening the these

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,030
are all big questions but for any

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,359
operator looking to the horizon and

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,640
seeing this coming it the most important

16
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,519
thing I think right now to emphasize is

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,590
that the the regulations currently

18
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,629
stipulate that all of these

19
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,810
record-keeping requirements that are

20
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:19,349
outlined you're obligated to be doing it

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,250
right now on a minimum of paper or some

22
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:25,408
sort of you know records so that

23
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,079
record-keeping onus is already here and

24
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,969
really looking at those regulations and

25
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,250
when you look at these these track and

26
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,438
trace elements and the things that are

27
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,590
going to have to be measured and the

28
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:41,179
points of this of the supply chain that

29
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,920
are going to be tracked that's kind of

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,030
the critical information that you need

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,710
to see and be incorporating into your

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,680
compliance programs and your operations

33
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,019
right now for anybody that hasn't taken

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,399
a gander at it here's a quick list of

35
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,618
some of the things you're gonna have to

36
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,750
enter into track and trace things like

37
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,489
the packaging of cannabis Goods the sale

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,228
of cannabis Goods the transportation of

39
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,118
cannabis Goods the receipt of cannabis

40
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:07,679
Goods the return of cannabis Goods the

41
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,959
destruction of disposal of cannabis

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,939
Goods lab testing and results any other

43
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,229
activity that they may choose to require

44
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,539
by any licensing

45
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:17,729
thirty at anytime you may have to put in

46
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:19,500
there you have to put information for

47
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:21,509
every activity for each of those

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,789
activities you have to put in the name

49
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:25,560
and type the you IDs the amount of the

50
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:27,598
Cannabis goods by waiter count the date

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,098
and time the activity happened the name

52
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,750
of the license number of whoever is

53
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,518
involved in it at any level of the

54
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,818
supply chain whether they're being

55
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,409
transported and so on and so forth the

56
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:38,969
date and time the arrival date the

57
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,560
estimated arrival time and when it

58
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:42,598
actually arrived and the driver's

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,009
license number of who's doing it so

60
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:48,839
those are some of the ones from the BCC

61
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:51,989
the I'm not done either there's more

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,239
thing just keep going you know if if

63
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,530
waste is disposed who disposed it what

64
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,180
was the employee's name what's their

65
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,949
employee number what was the reason that

66
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,719
it was destroyed or disposed and how

67
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,339
who's being collected it did you haul it

68
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,750
did somebody else haul it did you drop

69
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,280
it off how a manage did away

70
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,539
how much did away when it was there and

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,909
how much did away when you dropped it

72
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,858
off and any do any adjustments that have

73
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,139
to be made spoilage or following any

74
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:16,469
event any other information they might

75
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:19,798
need and all of these transactions have

76
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:24,389
to be put in to track and trace within

77
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,849
24 hours of them happening there were

78
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,900
efforts I guess where and that's just

79
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,318
the BCC

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,419
so that's just one agencies requirement

81
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:36,750
that doesn't go into the cultivation

82
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:39,540
side of the cultivation requirements for

83
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,729
track and trace which is that I mean

84
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,918
luckily cultivators you guys get three

85
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,289
days to put it in the system so you got

86
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,340
a little more time but there's every

87
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:52,679
event or change in disposition of your

88
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,780
plant material flowering destruction

89
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,299
disposal harvest processing storage

90
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,719
packaging all of those have to be

91
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,069
entered in at many different points and

92
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,560
ended back to the comments because we

93
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:06,659
can't stop talking about it they just

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,639
threw in another point of having to

95
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,340
weigh and enter the wet weight not just

96
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,590
the dry harvest weigh so this is why

97
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,329
these things are important in other

98
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:23,490
states people regularly bring on two to

99
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:26,158
three new employees whose sole job is to

100
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,509
monitor track and trace and to keep your

101
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:28,279
cyst

102
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:31,610
synched and to keep your physical

103
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:34,639
inventory synced you know that exactly

104
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:37,699
two to three employees so my company is

105
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,740
gonna have multiple distribution cross

106
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,479
docking locations around the state and

107
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,150
I'm gonna have to hire two the company's

108
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,860
gonna have to hire two to three people

109
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:49,339
just to run the track and trade system

110
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,160
and I'm get into this more but all those

111
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:54,439
requirements you listed are really fall

112
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,120
on the distributor because we're

113
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,100
alternately before this product goes to

114
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,530
retail we're supposed to make sure all

115
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,050
of that was put into the track and trade

116
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:08,779
system properly and we have to do that

117
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,740
however when we've done the training for

118
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:12,369
track and trace it's all about

119
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,620
cultivation right now there's not a

120
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,980
distribution track and trace training

121
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,550
per metric we have asked I have asked on

122
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,050
behalf of my clients it does not exist

123
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,150
California being very unique in that our

124
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:30,470
distribution model and our distributors

125
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:33,529
have a significantly more responsibility

126
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:36,380
including taxes than any other state

127
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:39,019
that metric is currently working in so

128
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:41,329
to Tim's point I had tell my clients

129
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,129
this is a line item in your budget when

130
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:45,469
you are thinking about who you're hiring

131
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:47,509
when you were thinking about how you're

132
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,850
going to forecast financials if you're

133
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:53,120
talking about how you're going to get

134
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:56,300
investment this is the biggest piece of

135
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,189
that it falls into compliance the

136
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,069
uncomfortable number that I generally

137
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:03,949
tell clients is it's 20 to 30% of your

138
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,930
operating budget currently moving

139
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,569
forward that should be designated to

140
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,100
specifically compliance when I say that

141
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:15,469
I do not mean legal

142
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:16,820
I mean track and trace compliance I like

143
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,350
to chime in that from like the

144
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:20,300
dispensary point of view because we're

145
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,180
the outlet that actually moves all the

146
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,620
product and I know that a lot of people

147
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,750
are freaking out I mean I you said it so

148
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,720
comically but it was scary as shit like

149
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,089
the stuff that we're gonna have to do

150
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,320
but I'm actually excited about this I

151
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:35,569
feel like here in California we're

152
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,029
building the national platform for how

153
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:40,149
we are gonna move this entire movement

154
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:41,679
that every single one of us is

155
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,379
volved and that we've been wanting this

156
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,480
to be national and international and we

157
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,149
are the pioneers in this industry so if

158
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,740
this kind of shit scares you good

159
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,839
however if it's gonna prevent you from

160
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,610
doing it right get out of the industry

161
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,859
because we have no choice now comment

162
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,139
when we have laws and regulations that

163
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,699
we don't want to see that are not guided

164
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,069
by people that work in the industry or

165
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:03,939
understand the industry but there's a

166
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,219
lot of this stuff that's really

167
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:07,750
important and that you know having a

168
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,550
system that's gonna be integrated having

169
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,220
good software that's gonna assist you

170
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:16,090
along the way and setting up good SOPs

171
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,590
right now last week last year to get you

172
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,089
prepared for what you're gonna do and if

173
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:20,619
this is the kind of stuff that like I

174
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:23,500
have seen when they kept when I got at

175
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,449
this industry four years ago we were

176
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,939
preparing for this and this is what we

177
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,079
have continued to do and we know that we

178
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:31,300
are going to have to continue to fight

179
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,469
if you're gonna be alive like over 90

180
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,980
percent of the companies that were on

181
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,120
the market two years ago are by E like

182
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,970
you're not here anymore

183
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,680
and they're not on my shelves and we're

184
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,210
having to find new product and right now

185
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,519
with what we just went through with July

186
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:47,680
first like my stores were actually in

187
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,240
really good condition content and

188
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,709
considering how the other ones were

189
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,030
because we had foresight and

190
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,279
understanding that breaths going on

191
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,809
vacation the end of June and we're gonna

192
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,519
get this shit taken care of beforehand

193
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,560
and that really what drove me to get it

194
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,120
done but honestly like we were sitting

195
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,610
so much better than a lot of stores

196
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,470
because they just didn't understand how

197
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,370
the regulations directly affected them

198
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:11,500
because they don't take a stance and

199
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,910
understand that they need to to read

200
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,850
these regulations and that's why we're

201
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,320
hiring people on also to just hire just

202
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,450
to handle compliance because as a

203
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,849
director of operations as the buyer for

204
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:24,699
the store I can't do it all I wear too

205
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,530
many hats and I didn't want to sound

206
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:28,449
pessimistic about track and trace

207
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,149
because I'm very excited the principle

208
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,009
is very exciting to me when I worked at

209
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,569
the Board of Equalization we talked

210
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:37,120
about tracking trace we talked about

211
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,270
what agencies were gonna be implemented

212
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,289
what type of data was gonna be

213
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,990
incorporated into a track and trace

214
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:47,259
system I believe track and trace is a

215
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:50,379
good thing I just want to know exactly

216
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:52,149
from my angle what is what I'm

217
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:53,009
responsible for and you know some

218
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,159
timelines when

219
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,899
gonna be in place when you know there's

220
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,449
been some promises by the state that

221
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:03,299
haven't come to fruition so here we are

222
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:06,600
so I'm very excited for track and trace

223
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:09,689
I think it's good for all the the legal

224
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,570
compliant actors and it reinforces our

225
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,540
place in the marketplace it also

226
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:18,030
provides you just from a economic

227
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:20,129
standpoint if you are prepared

228
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,559
you're not going to suffer I think this

229
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:26,189
is one of those great examples in time

230
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,319
where if you are an early adopter you

231
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,750
are going to reap those benefits it's

232
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,550
difficult I know from both the operators

233
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,139
on either of my side will tell you it is

234
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,870
a heavy lift but it is one that

235
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,210
ultimately will position them in the

236
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,159
marketplace to succeed they'll be

237
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,080
responsible they'll be known as

238
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,759
responsible operators along the supply

239
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,090
chain and from the retail perspective

240
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:51,569
they'll be trusted by the public to go

241
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:54,120
and secure the type of medication or

242
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,870
recreational product that they want so

243
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,600
as long as you are taking an active a

244
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:03,570
proactive stance about imposing what you

245
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,190
believe to be what the state wants is

246
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,070
we're starting to get that to be

247
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,170
crystallized if you have processes in

248
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,360
place SOPs if you're using them if

249
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,639
you're sending your shipping manifests

250
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,580
if you're using the tools that the

251
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,860
agencies have given you thus far

252
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:23,250
correcting them won't be such a painful

253
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,360
lift as what you hear from others who

254
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,129
are like this is going to take out my

255
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,409
business well if you weren't planning

256
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:30,750
for that unfortunately that's the

257
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:33,209
reality of what will happen and that's a

258
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,769
great point I mean at River that's what

259
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,470
we've been doing you know we've been

260
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:41,970
sending our shipping our invoices and

261
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:44,430
our Manifest into the BCC daily all the

262
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,460
test results on products and you know

263
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:50,879
January 1st all have gone to the bureau

264
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,100
and we are gearing ourselves up for this

265
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,230
we were gearing ourselves up for the for

266
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,389
the transfer the July 1st deadline even

267
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,769
though there was a lot of information

268
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:01,590
like oh they're gonna extend it they're

269
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:03,990
gonna extend it I never ever once

270
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,399
thought that they were gonna extend the

271
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,259
July 1st deadline I just

272
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,000
you know I know everybody in industry

273
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:12,360
was like it's gonna happen they're gonna

274
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,889
extend it I just being a regulator and

275
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,060
being on that side I knew that would

276
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:17,750
never happen

277
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,739
so you know being ready for this stuff

278
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,480
conditioning yourselves it's like you

279
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,129
know jogging in the morning you're

280
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,889
running trying to build that for a race

281
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:27,210
this is what this is so I would

282
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:29,819
recommend you do and that was a great

283
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,250
point and what I'd like to add on to

284
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,840
that is that as a buyer I had so many

285
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,909
companies that I have talked to since

286
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,860
January 1st and February when we got our

287
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:39,600
license that you're gonna be ready for

288
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,889
July you're gonna be you know your

289
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,659
packaging is gonna be there your lab

290
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:44,939
testing is gonna be there and I've had

291
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:46,589
all of these companies swear to me up

292
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,020
and down that they were gonna have their

293
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,000
shit together in a basket ready to go

294
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:53,549
and it was not anywhere close to the

295
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,190
basket like nothing was together we had

296
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:58,379
where my entire one of my departments

297
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,870
would be down to from 15 different

298
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:03,570
brands or different you know varieties

299
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,039
down to one item and I had several

300
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,260
companies that had their stuff together

301
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,799
like I'm gonna give props to heavy

302
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,909
hitters and dosis they were huge and

303
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,979
that some of these companies like up

304
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:16,589
north and Island that were able to give

305
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,779
me a range of products to have on my

306
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:21,269
shelf when no other store really had it

307
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,679
you know that's something that we did

308
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:24,720
not have the foresight these companies

309
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,569
did not and that's gonna stick on me as

310
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,820
a buyer remembering that you swore to me

311
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,000
that you would have it together and you

312
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,430
did not and right now I'm taking a lot

313
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,049
of companies without the maybe the

314
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,250
background that I'm searching for and

315
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:41,039
when I have that time where we can sit

316
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,110
down and have a dialogue but that time

317
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,509
will be over soon where it's like you

318
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,100
know right now any product but here in

319
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:49,439
the next few months things will be very

320
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,550
different as companies move forward and

321
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,280
I do think I just like to sit as painful

322
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:59,279
as it is for operators to be the guinea

323
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:02,370
pigs during this period it is an

324
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,429
incredible opportunity that we've gotten

325
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:08,490
to actually operate under emergency

326
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:11,219
regulations and have the opportunity to

327
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,769
truly experience the issues and problems

328
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,290
and hiccups so that we can in this

329
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,870
comment period before the regulations

330
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:20,610
are permanent have the opportunity to

331
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:24,120
actually test it out a little bit and

332
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:26,759
then suggest it but there's no it's not

333
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,639
to understate at all the impact that it

334
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,799
has been on operators and how difficult

335
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,500
it is for them to try to remain

336
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,569
compliant through the process because

337
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,759
something that might be is easy for a

338
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,879
regulatory agency is changing some

339
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,919
language has tens if not hundreds of

340
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,379
thousands dollars worth of impact on an

341
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,778
actual operating business that has to

342
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:51,720
redesign their packaging or pivot or

343
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:54,000
bring on all this extra labor or any

344
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,620
just the time that it takes where

345
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,080
they're like you can put a sticker on it

346
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,610
and just the cost of the labor to have a

347
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,740
bunch of people put a sticker on

348
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:07,379
something yeah exactly that those

349
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,389
aspects are are you know incredibly

350
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:12,210
difficult for the companies to be nimble

351
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:14,939
but it is important to keep your eyes

352
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,278
far forward on the horizon of those

353
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,710
regulations to see what's coming the

354
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,710
Department of Public Health said that in

355
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:25,769
the first five months of the new

356
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:28,379
regulations post January first they got

357
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:30,629
almost zero questions about packaging

358
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:33,480
and labeling in the transition period it

359
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:36,059
was only in that last few weeks before

360
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,580
it kicked in that suddenly everybody was

361
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:41,609
like oh shit you're serious like this is

362
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:44,339
happening and it was very difficult for

363
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:48,539
the companies that were not prepared to

364
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:51,150
do that pivot the universal symbol in

365
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:54,509
case anybody is unclear at this point

366
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:57,569
it shall be black if your packaging is

367
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:59,730
black then it can be well not on flour

368
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,550
we're talking about manufactured goods

369
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:06,360
it's very important manufactured goods

370
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:08,909
it must be black on flour wherever you

371
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,339
want to put it but I manufactured goods

372
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:13,949
at my speed black you can splash some

373
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:16,980
white on the back of it and still put it

374
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:20,790
on black packaging like if we spent less

375
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,159
time being upset about that concept

376
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:25,829
there were many solutions so if you

377
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,899
again if you stay ahead of it if you're

378
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,520
talking to your other operators if

379
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,309
you're going to your trade associations

380
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,460
there are so many solutions and

381
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:39,059
an industry I am always constantly

382
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:41,460
amazed at the ability to pivot and the

383
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:43,979
creativity that comes from the cannabis

384
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,050
space if you were willing to just engage

385
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,600
in a conversation and it should not go

386
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:51,389
unsaid all of you that are here you're

387
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,970
doing the first step in ensuring the

388
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,889
success of your business so you should

389
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,230
feel very accomplished and proud of

390
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:00,360
yourselves for showing up that is

391
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:06,839
basically what the cannabis industry as

392
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:08,370
a whole does it shows up industry I mean

393
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,740
just going through this whole process

394
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,629
and being a compliance director for a

395
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,720
distribution company so I mean

396
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:17,639
constantly on the phone with brands that

397
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,250
we represent and with the retailers we

398
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,720
saw and we're talking about regulations

399
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,490
we're talking about where that damn

400
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,100
universal symbol is supposed to be and

401
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,899
what color it's supposed to be and I'd

402
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,269
like those conversations I think that's

403
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,669
healthy I think you know we may disagree

404
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,990
and you know and maybe we have a

405
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:35,459
different reading of the regs but I

406
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,070
think that's great we're all trying to

407
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,290
get to this place this compliant place

408
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,670
wherever the state wants us to go and I

409
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:43,740
know the final rigs have different

410
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:45,569
packaging requirements now so pay

411
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,669
attention to that you know child

412
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,410
resistant packaging according to the

413
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:52,159
proposed final regs is on the retailer

414
00:16:49,409 --> 00:17:00,899
now so we'll see if that actually

415
00:16:52,159 --> 00:17:02,549
actually happens yeah but what we do

416
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,799
know what we do know about track and

417
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:06,799
trace if you have a temporary license

418
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,149
you're not required to be on it

419
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,299
depending on your locality I would like

420
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,100
to say because there are some local

421
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:16,619
there are some localities and up in

422
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,269
Humboldt that have their own local track

423
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,588
and trace that you have to be

424
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:24,389
functioning on already but as far as the

425
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:26,698
state is concerned and metric is

426
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,439
concerned it will be with the issuance

427
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,259
of your annual license

428
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,390
a clock starts ticking and you get your

429
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:37,410
annual license and you have so much time

430
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:39,480
to onboard to get your designated

431
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:42,870
Account Manager for metric track and

432
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,610
trace to be trained and it's a five day

433
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,689
window I believe in the regs right now

434
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:47,788
from if we

435
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,919
five days from getting your license to

436
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:51,898
have that person do the training as soon

437
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,929
as they've done that training you have

438
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:57,959
30 days to input every product you have

439
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:59,730
at whatever stage that it's in into your

440
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,129
track and trace everything has to be

441
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,278
input in that 30 days and after that

442
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:07,859
period of time its seed to sale nothing

443
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:11,460
can enter the system that isn't existing

444
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:12,689
in your system already at that point and

445
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,750
this is where I would actually really

446
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,639
like to see us making comment all of us

447
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,589
in the industry because as it comes to

448
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,808
the operator side like again we're the

449
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:23,128
ones moving your stuff and getting it

450
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:25,408
into patients hands and getting it to

451
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:28,109
customers hands is that it would be

452
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:30,809
wonderful and I'm not anticipating this

453
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:32,849
is that we really spend this fall and

454
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:35,788
this descend this early winter and to

455
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:37,469
focus on what the hell metric is and all

456
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:40,109
of us learning about it olives going

457
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,750
into multiple training modules so that

458
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:44,758
we can really master this so we have a

459
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,319
smooth transition because I don't know

460
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,569
about y'all but none of this has been

461
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,908
very smooth like this has been just

462
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:52,619
combated with questions constantly so I

463
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:55,200
would really love for the state to say

464
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:56,518
hey guys everybody's gonna work on this

465
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
this fall we're gonna get everybody's

466
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:00,058
licensing because you know they've

467
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,569
missed a lot of marks the state has

468
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:05,819
totally missed deadlines has left us in

469
00:19:03,569 --> 00:19:08,009
just waiting the plane the waiting game

470
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,509
just hurry up and wait and what I would

471
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:11,639
love is for them to say hey everybody on

472
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:13,798
January 1st 2019

473
00:19:11,638 --> 00:19:15,990
that's when metric starts because I'm

474
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,548
even confused as an operator that when

475
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,099
my stores are some of the first stores

476
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:21,898
here in LA there were licensed is I'm

477
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:23,699
gonna be placed in a situation where am

478
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:25,199
I only gonna be able to buy product from

479
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,450
distributors that are metric tracking

480
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,759
trays well then there I go again with

481
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,740
February where I couldn't buy product or

482
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,419
in July first when I don't have any

483
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,730
product on my shelves that every time we

484
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,070
do this this is a huge expense however

485
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,120
we've been in this game long enough that

486
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:40,918
we should have kind of had some

487
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,609
foresight on this and some money in the

488
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,840
bank but it is the situation great

489
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:49,469
comment point

490
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:52,528
Brett excellent metric is a it's

491
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:54,149
supposed to start from zero I think what

492
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:56,509
we've seen in other states that have had

493
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:59,419
an easier time is it has

494
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:02,000
beginning point unfortunately as clunky

495
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,820
as it was that didn't start on January 1

496
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,670
here in California so for commenting

497
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:10,789
that we have this opportunity to start

498
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:14,539
and that even temporary licensees

499
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:17,299
everybody January 1 2019 we do metric if

500
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:20,210
that's a universal comment we could be

501
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:23,359
so powerful as an industry to ask for

502
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:26,240
that just looking at what has happened

503
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,099
in other states we know I think there

504
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,279
was a great article and MJ Business

505
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:34,909
Daily over the weekend about Maryland

506
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:37,519
and the API that was part of metric was

507
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,470
trying to help consumers which was a

508
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,549
great thing right you as a consumer we

509
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,289
would want to know how much you've

510
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:44,269
purchased and how much you can purchase

511
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:46,849
within your purchasing limits not

512
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:49,670
everybody is a mathematician I know I am

513
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:51,529
a lawyer my math skills probably not the

514
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,300
best I would love if there was a

515
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:55,519
software that told me how much I still

516
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:58,639
could buy as a consumer what that did

517
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:02,210
unfortunately was overload the system

518
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,390
and therefore even other states outside

519
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,880
of Maryland had an impact because metric

520
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,370
wasn't able to keep up with the volume

521
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,850
what does that say to me California is

522
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:15,979
the highest volume of users from an

523
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:18,799
operational standpoint than the

524
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,839
teeny-tiny state of Maryland so we

525
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,480
probably have more operators than they

526
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,939
had both operators and consumers working

527
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,650
so if we take that into consideration

528
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,170
and that's sort of the basis of your

529
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,990
comment then maybe we can be effective

530
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:36,560
to really use that time as Brett said to

531
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,539
be prepared for metric so as a

532
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,509
distributor this is what I want to see

533
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:42,349
from metric so we have very clear

534
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:45,049
responsibilities according to state law

535
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:49,309
and the regs we collect the cultivation

536
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:51,829
tax we collect the excise tax we are

537
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:55,970
responsible for facilitating state

538
00:21:51,829 --> 00:22:01,279
certified testing producing a CoA on the

539
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:03,350
product we also wondered at the current

540
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,519
metric system we have to check and make

541
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:08,779
sure that everything's entered

542
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,990
incorrectly and right now from the

543
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:12,329
training that my company

544
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,950
has has received from from metric and

545
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:15,990
I'm not trying to I don't want to like

546
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:19,110
sound like I'm knocking metric or and

547
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,700
maybe also something we need to consider

548
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:22,769
too is maybe the states kind of slow

549
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,750
rolling this as well maybe it's not

550
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:26,069
metric maybe you know there's there's

551
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,599
issues going on and stay with

552
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:30,689
implementation so you have to remember

553
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:33,359
that but these are important issues that

554
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,980
I need to see where I can as a

555
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,799
distributor where I can track these

556
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,929
issues where especially like taxes like

557
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,480
cultivation tax is a prime example right

558
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:45,080
now I'm supposed to collect cultivation

559
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,120
taxes on product that was manufactured

560
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:50,759
into a candy bar and how am I supposed

561
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:53,459
to know as a distributor how much

562
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:56,039
product how much flour or how much trim

563
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,860
was actually put into that product and

564
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,389
therefore remitting it to see DTF a

565
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:03,359
California Department tax and fee

566
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,280
Administration sorry for that acronyms I

567
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,889
need to see I need to see that

568
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,079
information as a distributor you know

569
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,330
all that information for the retailers

570
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,769
when I send an invoice to a retailer you

571
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:15,210
know the excise tax I need to make sure

572
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:18,058
that that's in the track and trade

573
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:20,610
system I need to make sure that all this

574
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:22,500
data that's put in is entered in there

575
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:25,289
so as a distributor I can properly track

576
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,869
this and make sure that one I get it to

577
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:29,579
a retailer that it's you know compliant

578
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:32,009
and everything and also it needs to be

579
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:34,349
expeditious we don't need to be slowing

580
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:36,900
down it's already slow right now you

581
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:38,459
hinted at a lot of the brands not being

582
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,890
on board and we were we were there too a

583
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,069
lot of our brands just didn't believe us

584
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:46,380
and so they're catching up so you know

585
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:48,389
making this process is expeditious as

586
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,610
possible it's already slow with that and

587
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,730
testing and everything so you know

588
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:56,069
that's that's what I want to see as a

589
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,960
distributor and I want to get this

590
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:59,879
product out to the retailers as quick as

591
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,730
possible and so they can sell it and put

592
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,290
it in a consumers hands so you know my

593
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,849
company makes money the retailer makes

594
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:08,579
money and the consumer gets the product

595
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:11,490
that they ultimately want so you know

596
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,808
that's that's kind of my view of it and

597
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:17,400
I haven't had a lot of those questions

598
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:19,289
answered from about metrics and you know

599
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,030
one of the other thing that's important

600
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:23,829
is and we're missing in these

601
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:26,980
conversations is the local jurisdiction

602
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:29,679
the more confused they are the less

603
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:33,579
likely they are to adopt an ordinance

604
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:38,019
we're still at what 30 percent of the

605
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:40,869
the states 482 cities and 58 counties

606
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,849
that are regulating when I go out part

607
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:44,529
of what I do for clients is open up

608
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:45,969
cities I served as the special city

609
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:49,089
attorney for the city of Hollister

610
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,769
drafting their regulatory ordinance one

611
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:52,539
of the biggest questions they asked was

612
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:54,940
what was going on with track and trace

613
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:57,579
because it was important for them to

614
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,529
know that their operators were going to

615
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:01,599
be adopting into that similar to what

616
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:03,940
Julian was talking about with humble and

617
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,250
CIPA some people are carrying two tags

618
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:09,160
because it was so important for that

619
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:11,079
County or that city that jurisdiction to

620
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,180
have some assemblance of track and trace

621
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:16,319
when the state wasn't able to answer

622
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,340
those critical questions so it's also

623
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,200
understanding that so you can engage

624
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:22,119
with your municipalities for those of

625
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,190
you that are going through the planning

626
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:26,109
and building process that haven't opened

627
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,960
yet these are real critical questions

628
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:30,939
they'll also come back to how you pay

629
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,130
your local taxes because they're gonna

630
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,140
want to look at your track and trace to

631
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,970
make sure that you're paying the

632
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,060
appropriate amount so this is really a

633
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,009
systemic issue it's a bedrock issue for

634
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:44,470
me and one that everybody needs to be

635
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:46,269
able to speak eloquently on because

636
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,160
you're gonna have questions from your

637
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:51,029
retailer from your distributor from your

638
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,620
cultivator from your city from the state

639
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:54,910
investing in this and really starting to

640
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:57,699
understand it even though it's

641
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,640
complicated and difficult is going to be

642
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,680
how you are successful so we're all

643
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,750
spending a lot of money on point-of-sale

644
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:09,820
systems and he our PC our peas and we

645
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,700
have no idea how those are going to tie

646
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:15,849
into the track and trace system so I

647
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,309
would and this is very this is huge

648
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:20,709
because this is if they do not tie in

649
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:22,599
properly you're gonna be doing a lot of

650
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,630
manual entry which is going to increase

651
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:27,759
your operations cost so it's gonna hit

652
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,880
your it's going to hit your pocketbook I

653
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,700
believe you will see the marketing

654
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,740
points for POS systems radically

655
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,538
transform with the launch of track and

656
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,489
trace where it's going to

657
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:43,118
go from it's beautiful and iPad

658
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:45,999
interface to does it talk to track and

659
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:49,628
trace and does it talk to it in an

660
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:51,278
automated way or a manual way which I

661
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:54,219
would say when you are talking to your

662
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,778
POS companies is a number one question

663
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,079
to ask because a lot of them will be

664
00:26:55,778 --> 00:27:01,298
like sure it interfaces with track and

665
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:03,519
trace but what they mean is it at the

666
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:05,440
end of the day you can download a CSV

667
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,019
file that you're gonna spend hours

668
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,909
formatting the columns and then you're

669
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:12,098
gonna try to upload it to track and

670
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:14,349
trace and 98% of the time it's gonna

671
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:17,888
fail and you're gonna rip all your hair

672
00:27:14,348 --> 00:27:20,378
out and it's not actually updating track

673
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:23,678
and trace in an automated way and that's

674
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:25,658
the point as I work I have a client

675
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,999
who's a very well-known POS provider

676
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:30,129
track and trace provider and one of our

677
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:33,970
biggest issues right now is that it's

678
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:36,009
not the API with metric doesn't work so

679
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,899
it's not that they can tell you that

680
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:40,808
they can do something it's that it

681
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:43,268
doesn't compute so you do at the end of

682
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:46,298
the day with several of these almost all

683
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:48,729
of the POS systems will have to do some

684
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:50,499
manual data entry and those are

685
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:53,169
important questions to ask and I don't

686
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:56,769
think there is that widget or that fix

687
00:27:53,169 --> 00:28:02,950
that's been made yet to make that API

688
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:04,628
work so I just want to like kind of jump

689
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:08,019
on that one too about POS systems

690
00:28:04,628 --> 00:28:10,808
obviously at any retail business that is

691
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:12,548
a cornerstone of how you stay compliant

692
00:28:10,808 --> 00:28:15,819
and able to be successful in getting

693
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:19,598
people in and out of your store and so

694
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:21,038
we we formerly had bio track and we were

695
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:23,589
ready to try something that was gonna be

696
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,538
a little bit more modern and there was

697
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:27,579
gonna have some better abilities for us

698
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:29,259
and so we had tried out we had talked

699
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:31,739
with several companies and we made a

700
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:34,659
decision to go with the company trees

701
00:28:31,739 --> 00:28:36,909
I've heard multiple different things

702
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:38,559
from multiple different companies one of

703
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:40,539
the companies that I highly recommend as

704
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,989
well is green bits every time I've

705
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:46,028
worked with them they've been amazing

706
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:47,679
like their team is and from everything

707
00:28:46,028 --> 00:28:50,019
that being told as well that they are

708
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,210
metric compliant

709
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,799
and and integrated and they will be

710
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,509
fully working with that because at the

711
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,970
end of the night I'm going to be paying

712
00:28:55,509 --> 00:29:00,099
all this extra payroll and be going

713
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,210
through managers quite rapidly when

714
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:03,339
they're gonna have to be staying there

715
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,720
late uploading and making sure that when

716
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:06,429
that distributor dropped off that

717
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,230
product at my store that we entered in

718
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:10,360
that 24 digit PIN or if not it's gonna

719
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,930
kick back the entire damn report and

720
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:15,759
that is gonna be bad staff morale and

721
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,140
that's honestly one of my most important

722
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,849
things that I look for in my store is

723
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,020
making sure that my staff is happy

724
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:22,119
because if a staff is happy they're

725
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:23,799
productive and that metric is really

726
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,269
gonna slow things down and that's why we

727
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:26,589
need to streamline this stuff as much as

728
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:30,670
possible so that's why you're very much

729
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:32,769
you urge you to please comment and and

730
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,660
speak about how we need to postpone

731
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:36,009
maybe metrics so that we all jump on at

732
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,529
the same time so that we're all on the

733
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:40,150
same page and on that is please if

734
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:42,670
you're in the industry and we get that

735
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:45,370
allowance do not take it for granted I

736
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,690
actually do like do your homework and I

737
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:49,149
think there's a gentleman over here that

738
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,580
actually had a question just summarizing

739
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:54,280
the question it was this gentleman has

740
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:56,710
multiple license types he's gonna get

741
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:59,440
hit from cultivation retail distribution

742
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,360
and manufacturing and track and trace

743
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,100
requirements therein and has been

744
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,099
approached by many different

745
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:07,419
out-of-state operator

746
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:09,279
consultants saying you know we can help

747
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,470
you with training in advance of this

748
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,399
system and how useful that may or may

749
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:17,230
not be and what do you do to prepare now

750
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,500
for that system it's important to

751
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,720
remember that California is unique I

752
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,849
think this is a tried-and-true issue

753
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,890
sometimes our state consultants are

754
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:29,559
great right am I gonna knock that but

755
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:33,250
when you're in California you've got

756
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:35,559
resources all around you we are all

757
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,319
going through this together I don't know

758
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:41,079
if any of you are on band watch but

759
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,539
Jackie McGowan site is great it will

760
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,369
Network you with others who are going

761
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:47,649
through and suffering through some of

762
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:50,079
the same trials and tribulations that

763
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,730
you are going through and together like

764
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,149
I said before California is very

765
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:58,180
resilient and as an industry we tend and

766
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,730
now need to lean on each other more

767
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,740
because we have different license types

768
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,519
problem with outside consultants is they

769
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,370
come in and they

770
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,529
you oh so you're a myth no you're not

771
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:10,779
you're a manufacturer and you're a type

772
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:13,509
6 type you're a type 7 type 6 type n

773
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:15,490
type P right you're different and now

774
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:17,019
you're not just different in semantics

775
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,150
you're different in what you're allowed

776
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:21,369
to do and how the product moves through

777
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,810
the supply chain so you're a vertically

778
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:25,059
integrated business there are other

779
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:26,950
vertically integrated businesses go to

780
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:30,460
your community your cannabis community

781
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:31,390
and ask what those problems are as we go

782
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,759
through it together

783
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,470
I know CCIA will wind up doing a lot of

784
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,569
metric training and there will be a

785
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,029
committee on that go to your trade

786
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:42,250
associations that are local and pull

787
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:44,049
from your local community because it is

788
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,839
true I've seen outside consultants come

789
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:49,059
in and do an application and don't

790
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:51,009
realize that a local application is the

791
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:53,470
equivalent of another state's

792
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:55,119
state level application and all the

793
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,039
sudden enough to clean up a mess for a

794
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,629
client that maybe got ousted from a

795
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,809
jurisdiction that they should have been

796
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:04,150
in so it's it's a tagline of be cautious

797
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:05,950
beware beat your best advocate if

798
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,360
somebody tells you that they can tell

799
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,670
you how metric is gonna work in

800
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,959
California ask them to show you first

801
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:14,670
the proof is in the pudding who else

802
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,559
have you done this for I also think that

803
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:20,800
the like I was reading the list before

804
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:23,470
where this is where you're practicing

805
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,019
your internal programs and building them

806
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:28,329
around the stated regulatory of

807
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:30,519
requirements for record-keeping is the

808
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:32,529
best thing that you can look at is what

809
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,420
is it saying in the regs are these

810
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:36,789
checkpoints of when do I have to weigh

811
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,860
it when do I have to report it when do I

812
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,420
have to write it down when do it you

813
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:43,209
know all of these transfer points the

814
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:45,190
shipping manifest is already something

815
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,960
it's a document that's gonna be in track

816
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,880
and trace that's already been released

817
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,640
by the agency that people are supposed

818
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,260
to be using now I don't know how many of

819
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,060
you guys are actually using a shipping

820
00:32:53,259 --> 00:33:01,059
manifest to move product from one

821
00:32:55,059 --> 00:33:04,000
location good for you BCC C a govt send

822
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:08,289
it to the basic BCC website do it every

823
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,900
day that's great and and it's the good

824
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:13,750
thing about this period before track and

825
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:17,200
trace is kicked in is that it's practice

826
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:18,700
it's paper practice because you do not

827
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,009
want to be trying to figure this out

828
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,440
when the 30-day clock is ticking to

829
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:26,259
actually enter it all in there for real

830
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,419
you want to be able to troubleshoot and

831
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:31,000
test drive these systems and have your

832
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:32,860
staff be confident and know what they're

833
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,138
doing and informed about the check

834
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:37,689
points and not have it all be this

835
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:41,288
incredible load that's dumped on them in

836
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:43,179
this very short window and in working I

837
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:44,440
mean it's the big catch phrase that

838
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:45,759
everybody talks about culture of

839
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,669
compliance and a culture of compliance

840
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:51,519
but it's hugely important because it's

841
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:55,090
very important from every level of your

842
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,888
employees to understand why they have to

843
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:58,928
do this and not think that it's just

844
00:33:56,888 --> 00:34:00,699
some ridiculous rigmarole that you're

845
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:03,179
making up to make their lives difficult

846
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,528
that it is a regulatory legal

847
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:07,929
requirement that could result in

848
00:34:05,528 --> 00:34:10,599
tremendous amounts of fines in the loss

849
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:13,480
of your license if somebody doesn't fill

850
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:17,079
out the form and I know Julie does this

851
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,240
we do this at my um in my companies we

852
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:21,609
can come out and audit you there are

853
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:24,068
compliance services that will come out

854
00:34:21,608 --> 00:34:25,929
and we will work through that with you

855
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:28,029
and we'll say oh you know what

856
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:30,429
hey your seller's permits not out you

857
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,599
know that nifty little temporary license

858
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:33,550
that you got that's sitting in the back

859
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,289
office that has to go out in a

860
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,119
conspicuous place for everybody to see

861
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:38,739
and we'll go through and look at your

862
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,639
shipping manifest in and see that you're

863
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:42,818
doing it correctly

864
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:46,149
now that is a great expense that has a

865
00:34:42,818 --> 00:34:49,659
huge ROI for your company so hire an

866
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:52,898
outside person before BC CDFA or DPH

867
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:54,760
come out and do an on-site audit so

868
00:34:52,898 --> 00:34:56,259
there are companies out there that do

869
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,849
that you just need to look for them and

870
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,119
I know this gentleman has been so

871
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:00,119
patient

872
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:15,539
what I'm gonna say about that all 10

873
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,930
mental states and DC although uh Pamela

874
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:19,230
right

875
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:21,719
yes and was 100% correct California is a

876
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:25,619
lot more complex we are passing at a

877
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:27,598
country with our laws and everything I

878
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:30,329
would interject themselves and what can

879
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,820
I forget see you guys here asking from

880
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:35,429
out-of-state how they did things we have

881
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,670
resources and what questions give my

882
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:41,789
card afterwards if plenty of FLD with

883
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,900
people have deviled metric the three

884
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:46,190
biggest things that I would say about

885
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,190
metric it's gonna stuff

886
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:53,650
it's not to be a punchline or anything

887
00:35:49,429 --> 00:35:57,319
like that bad data in if bad data out

888
00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:03,070
yep never smartest people on that system

889
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:08,480
we're gonna be fuck I agree with that

890
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:10,640
couldn't have said that better something

891
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,320
that I've been blessed with is

892
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,059
colleagues and friends in this industry

893
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,789
that have helped me along the way and I

894
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:18,230
do kind of want to give a shout out to

895
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:19,730
one of my closest colleagues and I

896
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,969
consider our true friend is Cassie

897
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:25,490
Walker in the back and she is the SOP

898
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:27,858
queen she is the one that comes through

899
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:30,409
and makes sure that every all the I's

900
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:32,929
are dotted the T's are crossed and has

901
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:34,399
gotten our inventory on point with our

902
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:37,429
stores because that is something in our

903
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,260
industry as people just took no

904
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:41,000
responsibility for where there was their

905
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,950
inventory was the only time you counted

906
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,300
it is if you needed to order the product

907
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:47,029
and then I was like yeah it's a little

908
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,850
off like that's not gonna be acceptable

909
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,500
like everything has to be on point and

910
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:52,940
that was what I was really excited this

911
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,590
mornings when I was in the store over at

912
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,690
Green Cross and Cassie comes through and

913
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,760
like all the flowers on point and I'm

914
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,740
like that's amazing because that is what

915
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,650
we have to work to you like metrics not

916
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:06,259
gonna be that bad if your inventories

917
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,300
are on point and your SOPs are on point

918
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,190
and you actually have protocols and this

919
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,320
is what's forcing us to professionalize

920
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:14,090
our industry I come from emergency

921
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,619
veterinary medicine where we have

922
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:18,140
controlled drugs like shit that actually

923
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:20,600
kills people and you know unlike

924
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:22,429
cannabis you know and so it's like we

925
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,319
have to count our fentanyl every month

926
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:29,960
we have to count our morphine and our

927
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:31,400
hydromorphone and ketamine and we have

928
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,769
to actually count this stuff and

929
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,690
actually provide this to this day and to

930
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:38,449
the federal government on where this is

931
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:40,400
going and so when I got into cannabis I

932
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:42,199
was so shocked because we had no

933
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,090
accountability whatsoever people would

934
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:47,480
just show up with a trash bag full of

935
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:49,070
weed and then you know sell it to the

936
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,690
store and it's now we're in this system

937
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,090
where it's like you have to take

938
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,260
responsibility for where you're at and a

939
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,700
lot of people that are griping about it

940
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,140
they just don't want to change the way

941
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:59,149
that they're doing things but this is

942
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:00,440
going to make us better and you'll have

943
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,050
somebody on your team that know

944
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,909
how to write SOPs and knows how to adapt

945
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,960
to when we get a new regulation instead

946
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:07,848
of sitting there and wasting all this

947
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,519
energy bitching and moaning about it I

948
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:11,990
actually put that energy into it and I

949
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:14,750
have been blessed with the people around

950
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:17,568
me in this industry that share the same

951
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,849
level of integrity and the philosophy of

952
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:21,769
the movement of cannabis and want to see

953
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:23,660
this to be successful and that's why I'm

954
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:26,239
very thankful for and to echo what the

955
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:28,549
gentleman from Baker was saying one of

956
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,679
the most tremendous resources that I've

957
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:33,859
had for really getting a glimpse into

958
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:37,098
how metric and track and trace works and

959
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:39,500
what it looks like is doing demos with

960
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:41,838
POS companies in other states because

961
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,849
you can go look at look at the other

962
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,009
states that have track and trace the

963
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:48,170
other states that have metric who are

964
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:50,420
the top what are the POS companies

965
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,670
working there and call them up and they

966
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:55,369
have been the most helpful people and I

967
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,990
have done walkthroughs and demos and

968
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:58,880
they've showed me what the forms look

969
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:00,858
like and how it looks like to enter it

970
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,630
and how it interfaces with that and

971
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:05,029
they're they're a tremendous resource

972
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:07,338
and then what's great is you can ask

973
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:09,619
them for references of what companies

974
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:12,230
are they working with there and then

975
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:14,480
have those companies help you understand

976
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,699
how is that process what's it like and

977
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,699
that that community is available that

978
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:20,929
we're not the first well there are

979
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:22,460
distinctions and complications to

980
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:24,559
California we're not the first ones

981
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,150
going into this track and trace system

982
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,309
so there are other people who have

983
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,079
experience to share and that's a

984
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:32,179
difference between a consultant and a

985
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,250
company so a company that's gonna walk

986
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:37,669
you through a POS system or if you call

987
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:40,550
a cultivator or a manufacturer or you

988
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:42,619
meet somebody at upcoming and CIA who is

989
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:44,510
in another metric state and you ask them

990
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:46,490
those questions that is very different

991
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:48,140
than a consultant so I just want to make

992
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:49,909
sure that that was said because I think

993
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:52,219
that was a great point and thank you for

994
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:54,409
raising it the other thing I will say is

995
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:57,348
start reconciling your inventory every

996
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:59,210
14 days you got to do it when you come

997
00:39:57,349 --> 00:40:01,099
online it should be something that as

998
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,750
soon as you get the temperament before

999
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,460
you do because now everybody that's

1000
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:07,969
getting temperaments is starting day one

1001
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:10,460
right day one you do your inventory 14

1002
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:13,309
days later you reconcile that inventory

1003
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,940
make it a pattern in a practice it'll be

1004
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:16,369
a happy

1005
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,409
that you will just automatically you and

1006
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:21,800
your staff will know how to do and the

1007
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:23,960
14 days is a requirement and in BCC reg

1008
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,910
so that's just not just the number she

1009
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,849
was making up that's actually like a

1010
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:30,588
requirement so we were practicing that

1011
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:34,670
too and if you're you know you have to

1012
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:38,108
be within 2% so it's kind of a fine kind

1013
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:41,240
of a fine line so you know practice that

1014
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:43,250
my only we mentioned about other states

1015
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:46,489
now others a lot of other states don't

1016
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:48,440
have a distribution model so so this is

1017
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:51,159
where track and trace kind of worries me

1018
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:55,579
and I can't really look to another state

1019
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:57,769
on what I need is a distributor from

1020
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:00,349
metric and what what I can expect I mean

1021
00:40:57,769 --> 00:41:02,750
we'll figure it out whatever it is but

1022
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:05,240
it's a little tough for us but I am glad

1023
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,980
that you know for retailers that you

1024
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:08,659
know they have some examples my name is

1025
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,670
Rico sorry for you anybody didn't hear

1026
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:13,129
me we work with a ton of POS systems

1027
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:16,039
across the across the nation ton of

1028
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:17,568
track and trace systems and bottom line

1029
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:19,849
is California's more complex there's

1030
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:21,199
more volume than everywhere else we have

1031
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:24,440
different channels and everywhere else

1032
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:26,389
it's going to suck is a platform chosen

1033
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,030
by the state whether it's bio track with

1034
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:30,818
this metric there's other systems as

1035
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:33,380
well they don't know what they're doing

1036
00:41:30,818 --> 00:41:35,960
they get chosen by the state they get a

1037
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,640
contract and it's gonna crash a bunch of

1038
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,829
times whether it's metric whether it is

1039
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:41,029
your POS you're using so this is why I

1040
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:43,099
was saying I wasn't trying to joke or

1041
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:44,240
anything get your smartest people on the

1042
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:47,119
system because your business is on the

1043
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:49,189
line number one you need a backup person

1044
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:54,079
as well you need a great great SOPs for

1045
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:56,389
backups as well you need truth in data

1046
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,650
as well our company we try to connect

1047
00:41:56,389 --> 00:42:00,469
all your systems so everybody has the

1048
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:02,990
same data work with were three companies

1049
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:03,980
that work with other platforms as well

1050
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:05,868
because you're going to need those

1051
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,730
backups you're gonna need that integrity

1052
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:10,130
from your backup system and then your

1053
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:12,019
backup to your backup system I know it

1054
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,430
sounds like a lot and it is a lot but

1055
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:16,130
these are the things you need to do to

1056
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:18,259
operate in this business all right so

1057
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,849
when you go out and you have a lot of

1058
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,369
POS system saying the Oh your POS

1059
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:24,980
compliant we're a metric compliant in

1060
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:26,070
California nobody's compliant so that's

1061
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,889
a lie

1062
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,600
they've applied and they've passed the

1063
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:33,269
tests but they're not compliant nobody

1064
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:34,829
is using the system yet so what you

1065
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:36,119
should do there's some systems that are

1066
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:37,739
working there's some pluses that are

1067
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,289
working out of state they're compliant

1068
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:41,189
with metric ask them questions it

1069
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:42,539
doesn't mean they're gonna have all the

1070
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,510
answers cuz nobody is doing it in

1071
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:49,469
California if you have a POS that is

1072
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:52,290
that is approved by metric ask them a

1073
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:53,819
ton of questions ask their clients a ton

1074
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:55,409
of questions don't jump in because it's

1075
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,710
a new shiny object and it looks good

1076
00:42:55,409 --> 00:43:00,629
make sure that it works and then you

1077
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:04,019
always keep the other guy's phone number

1078
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,980
handy because something will fail and if

1079
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:10,440
they're not giving the service you need

1080
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:12,119
move that's all I say all right I want

1081
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,130
to leave a little time for questions

1082
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,130
does anybody have any questions

1083
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:29,340
working with companies that are willing

1084
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:33,210
to interface together if you're not

1085
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:34,980
compliant in what respect you could lose

1086
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,900
your license your license could be

1087
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,510
revoked and then you could be precluded

1088
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,730
from then going into another

1089
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:44,670
jurisdiction we can look no further than

1090
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:47,579
our neighbor Colorado who lives to try

1091
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:51,000
to come into California sweetleaf is a

1092
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:53,579
good example right looping that was an

1093
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,860
issue that and this that's a great

1094
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:57,719
example actually sweetleaf because let's

1095
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,820
let's think about it break it down the

1096
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:02,399
issue was looping right and they were

1097
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,750
asking whether or not you could buy more

1098
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,369
than one ounce in one day so you just

1099
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,429
went to the back of the line is that a

1100
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:11,219
good SOP practice in general if you were

1101
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:12,690
a retail operator and somebody told you

1102
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:14,399
oh yeah you could do that don't worry

1103
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:17,220
the regs think they say that they're

1104
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,320
just ambiguous in that area does that

1105
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:22,019
seem like you would be diverting product

1106
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,450
is there a reason that one person would

1107
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:27,929
need to purchase an entire pound of

1108
00:44:24,449 --> 00:44:30,449
marijuana in one day for themselves and

1109
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:33,149
wasn't going to spread it around to

1110
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:37,439
other people if it sounds like a bad

1111
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:38,010
idea it probably is because now that

1112
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,260
company

1113
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:42,330
we'll have to because in both local

1114
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,970
jurisdictions in California and the

1115
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:47,549
state if you have any violation same or

1116
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:50,279
similar within a marijuana industry you

1117
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:52,110
have to disclose it and if you think

1118
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,210
that with the high level of competition

1119
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:56,039
in this state a local jurisdiction is

1120
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:59,909
going to select an operator who had

1121
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:02,550
twenty nine twenty six licenses revoked

1122
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:05,750
in the city of Denver because they were

1123
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:08,430
providing too much product without

1124
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:12,389
tracking and tracing and ensuring that

1125
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:13,739
there wasn't diversion then that is it

1126
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:18,599
that will never happen

1127
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:20,819
so compliance today is we are livelihood

1128
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:24,119
tomorrow because this happened what four

1129
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:26,730
or five years later they don't care once

1130
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,949
these agencies set the dust settles and

1131
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:30,630
they have nothing better to do they have

1132
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:34,230
five years to audit you here in

1133
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:36,980
California what you do today will harm

1134
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,980
you tomorrow

1135
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:49,659
I think that that goes like back to what

1136
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:51,670
Pamela was saying here is that your SOPs

1137
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:53,889
in place so staying compliant should be

1138
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,940
how you make sure that every day you're

1139
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:56,579
going through that but also having

1140
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,500
integrity on how you run your business

1141
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:01,659
so it's not just about staying compliant

1142
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,510
like there's always gonna be loopholes

1143
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:06,069
to every single one of these regulations

1144
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:08,200
like I don't know like having mobile

1145
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,550
billboards that run around with med men

1146
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:11,469
on them and they sit on in your back

1147
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:13,870
parking lot of your business so that

1148
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:15,639
whenever you're low on product it's a

1149
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:17,469
mobile billboard for their company

1150
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:19,389
that's the kind of stuff that does not

1151
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:21,309
gain you respect in this industry so

1152
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:24,609
maybe you're finding a loophole to be

1153
00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:26,500
compliant but you are not gaining the

1154
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,940
respect of your brothers and sisters

1155
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,519
that have fought their asses off to

1156
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,320
pioneer this industry and that does not

1157
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:34,630
gain our respect I don't care about

1158
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,760
competition competition drives us to do

1159
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,039
better but when you are going to find

1160
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,100
loopholes to stay compliant but you're

1161
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:44,230
just bullshit with it that upsets me

1162
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:46,360
because we're in this I'm in this for

1163
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:47,949
the medicine I care that adult you

1164
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,180
should be totally legal for people and

1165
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:50,889
we need to stay compliant to make sure

1166
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:52,929
that happens but I am fighting for the

1167
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:55,569
medicine that has saved my life and then

1168
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:59,019
it saved so many others so notice they

1169
00:46:55,570 --> 00:47:01,269
will come back and get you yeah the

1170
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:05,070
cannabis industry is a community so

1171
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:07,389
every time there is an issue where

1172
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:10,750
license is revoked because of

1173
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:13,059
non-compliance that hurts us all that

1174
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,829
just doesn't it doesn't hurt just the

1175
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:17,110
business that got their license revoked

1176
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:18,849
hurts us all because when I'm trying to

1177
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:20,530
go into another city and they're like

1178
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:22,299
well I read this article about this

1179
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,040
company that did this you're probably

1180
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,320
going to do the same right you're prade

1181
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:29,710
they lump you all in together they lump

1182
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:31,840
us all in together and so this is a

1183
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,789
community kind of effort too we all need

1184
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,280
to be compliant because we're just

1185
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:39,340
hurting everybody else we're keeping

1186
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,050
another another locality from opening up

1187
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,970
do you know how many cities there are in

1188
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,920
the state of California there's about

1189
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:48,949
fourth

1190
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:51,320
482 cities and 58 counties and special

1191
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:55,369
jurisdictions on top of that this is

1192
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:58,610
this is a nation and when we have a bad

1193
00:47:55,369 --> 00:48:01,309
actor and one part of the state it could

1194
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:04,340
be in the smallest little city it could

1195
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:07,250
affect us all and this it's important to

1196
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:11,480
think of track and trace is not just

1197
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:13,610
some horrible record-keeping onus that

1198
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:17,230
was came out of thin air like it's an

1199
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:20,930
antidote to fear it's an antidote to

1200
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:23,860
demonstrating a comprehensive system of

1201
00:48:20,929 --> 00:48:27,500
accountability and transparency that it

1202
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:30,470
does something unprecedented in industry

1203
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:33,800
there is no other industry that has ever

1204
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:36,349
had to have this level of rigor from

1205
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,890
seed to sale and the thing that gets me

1206
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:41,960
excited is if we can do this then we get

1207
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:45,079
to turn around in ask it of other

1208
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,360
industries to say I don't want to know

1209
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:51,799
Campbell Soup whether this tomato come

1210
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:53,690
from I want to know as a consumer I want

1211
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,970
to see this chain I want to see where

1212
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:58,579
everybody else is doing tomfoolery

1213
00:48:55,969 --> 00:49:01,429
because they don't have to do this so

1214
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:05,059
that we are pioneering this incredible

1215
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:07,190
system of consumer protection of market

1216
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:10,039
protection of transparency of

1217
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:13,730
information that everybody on the chain

1218
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:15,619
who is a compliant operator who cares

1219
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:17,809
about patience who cares about what

1220
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:20,179
people put in their body we want to know

1221
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:22,369
where did it come from we want to know

1222
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:23,750
the legacy of this product we want to

1223
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:26,000
know what it contains we want to know

1224
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:28,159
what the test results are and so it's

1225
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,199
not just some horrible thing that's

1226
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:32,210
happening to us it's an amazing and

1227
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:35,869
comprehensive system and it also

1228
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:37,730
provides federal protection because what

1229
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:39,859
we're demonstrating is that there is not

1230
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:41,780
diversion in our system that these

1231
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,970
operators are compliant that they are

1232
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:46,400
operating compliantly under the state

1233
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:48,469
regulations so thank you very much feds

1234
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,680
you can stay over there because we are

1235
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:54,169
willing to expose this information yeah

1236
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:57,548
this gentleman asked how are we

1237
00:49:54,170 --> 00:50:00,099
submitting our reports to the BC secret

1238
00:49:57,548 --> 00:50:07,168
you're in an industry that's never been

1239
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:09,939
before yeah so so we submit invoices

1240
00:50:07,168 --> 00:50:13,808
every day to the BCC before they go out

1241
00:50:09,938 --> 00:50:15,308
for delivery and then we also submit any

1242
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:18,880
testing results that we have from

1243
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:22,479
product in fact any state certified

1244
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:26,739
tests that come from a lab are submitted

1245
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:28,958
to the BCC so they'll if it passes is no

1246
00:50:26,739 --> 00:50:32,559
problem if there's a fail for like a

1247
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:35,048
label claim THC CBD or pesticides which

1248
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,298
doesn't happen very often they will

1249
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:39,398
inform us what your remediation method

1250
00:50:37,298 --> 00:50:42,309
will state a remediation method if it's

1251
00:50:39,398 --> 00:50:44,248
just a label claim fell distributors in

1252
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:47,109
the state of California can real able

1253
00:50:44,248 --> 00:50:50,278
those those and that's pretty easy as

1254
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:54,728
long as they're not over the limits so

1255
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:57,639
yeah we simply paper records we have we

1256
00:50:54,728 --> 00:51:00,098
just we just scan them and and and email

1257
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:06,638
them to the BOE RC the BCC sorry now BOE

1258
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:08,829
so yeah just PDFs yeah just yeah what

1259
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:11,919
type what percentage of retailers pay

1260
00:51:08,829 --> 00:51:15,249
river distributing the taxes that's a

1261
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:18,848
hundred percent because we collected Co

1262
00:51:15,248 --> 00:51:20,708
D because we are responsible for

1263
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:22,509
emitting that tax and we have 90 days

1264
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:25,778
from whenever that transaction takes

1265
00:51:22,509 --> 00:51:27,759
place so we're not gonna float the

1266
00:51:25,778 --> 00:51:29,438
excise tax there's just no way any

1267
00:51:27,759 --> 00:51:31,688
distributor in the right mind shouldn't

1268
00:51:29,438 --> 00:51:33,998
be doing that you know I'm sure there's

1269
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:35,558
a lot of honest you know retailers that

1270
00:51:33,998 --> 00:51:37,868
would pay those taxes and pay that but

1271
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:40,569
honestly in the position we're in now we

1272
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:43,809
collect that Co D okay not and you

1273
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:46,298
actually can't do full consignment

1274
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:49,569
anymore you actually have to take the

1275
00:51:46,298 --> 00:51:51,489
excise tax at the time of delivery so

1276
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:53,288
that there's no there is no consignment

1277
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:55,539
on excise tax and I think that that's

1278
00:51:53,289 --> 00:51:57,369
also something that we need to let

1279
00:51:55,539 --> 00:51:59,109
patients and customers know now it's

1280
00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:00,039
like this whole I go to the events all

1281
00:51:59,108 --> 00:52:02,380
the time they keep talking about this

1282
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,959
15% I'm like what 15% are you talking

1283
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:08,259
about because this is on like on the

1284
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:10,879
fair market value this is a 24% tax that

1285
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:13,670
patients these are actual patients so I

1286
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,650
deal with mothers that spend $1500 a

1287
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:17,720
month before all of this happened to

1288
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:20,150
provide seizure medication for their

1289
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:23,118
children and now they are getting hit

1290
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:26,028
not just with excise tax but also with

1291
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,950
sales tax and then 5% medical tax and

1292
00:52:26,028 --> 00:52:30,108
they can't go get a medical card because

1293
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:32,118
the city is so fucked with the way that

1294
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:33,679
they hand these things out that it takes

1295
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:35,269
them months to be able to get their

1296
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:36,078
actual card the way that they're

1297
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:37,788
supposed to because they're getting

1298
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:43,250
denied every time they go to the office

1299
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:45,500
or the appointments aren't available to

1300
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:48,289
removal the sales and use tax which to

1301
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:52,548
Julie's point earlier how is that not a

1302
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:57,230
lawsuit you are imposing taxes adult use

1303
00:52:52,548 --> 00:53:00,048
taxes for medicine yeah but the but I

1304
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:01,818
mean and sorry you know to bust

1305
00:53:00,048 --> 00:53:04,518
everybody's bubble but cannabis is not

1306
00:53:01,818 --> 00:53:06,380
considered a medicine by the state of

1307
00:53:04,518 --> 00:53:08,568
California you can't get a

1308
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:10,068
recommendation you you can't get a

1309
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:13,548
prescription you can get a

1310
00:53:10,068 --> 00:53:16,699
recommendation you you we had this issue

1311
00:53:13,548 --> 00:53:18,699
come up at BOE all the time in fact we

1312
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:22,399
you know there was legislation to

1313
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:27,409
basically for medical cannabis before

1314
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:29,358
prop 64 to have a sales tax exemption

1315
00:53:27,409 --> 00:53:31,219
from those products considering it

1316
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:33,500
medicine but it's considered a

1317
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:35,739
recommendation not a prescription it's

1318
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:38,059
not considered a medicine and it's not

1319
00:53:35,739 --> 00:53:40,098
you're not relieved of any sales tax

1320
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:42,559
liability other than if you're a

1321
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:45,910
qualified medical patient with a card

1322
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,910
from your County

1323
00:53:46,550 --> 00:54:00,089
the news mm use tax tax tax excise tax

1324
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:03,019
collected by the distributor or paid

1325
00:54:00,088 --> 00:54:03,019
elected

1326
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:15,028
it depends on the business arrangement

1327
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:17,130
so he's asked he's asking if the

1328
00:54:15,028 --> 00:54:19,920
distributors required to collect the

1329
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:22,380
excise tax no and yes

1330
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,720
so yes in the sense if it's an arm's

1331
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:27,028
length transaction and when I say arm's

1332
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:30,088
length transaction that means that I'm a

1333
00:54:27,028 --> 00:54:33,088
distributor and I have no absolutely no

1334
00:54:30,088 --> 00:54:35,369
relationship ownership in the retail arm

1335
00:54:33,088 --> 00:54:37,469
of that company now there's a lot of

1336
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:39,599
micro businesses out there where they

1337
00:54:37,469 --> 00:54:42,269
have distribution retail manufacturing

1338
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:45,568
or cultivation whatever they can have

1339
00:54:42,269 --> 00:54:48,298
three of those license so if I do have

1340
00:54:45,568 --> 00:54:50,159
that relationship then the excise tax is

1341
00:54:48,298 --> 00:54:55,250
collected at the point of sell on

1342
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:55,250
whatever that product sold for

1343
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:12,000
that's a it's an arm's-length

1344
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:15,210
transaction sotae for simple layman's

1345
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,608
point of view yes that I wouldn't if I

1346
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:19,980
didn't own any part of that retailer

1347
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:23,369
yes it's an arm's length transaction I

1348
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:25,260
applied the state the markup the sixty

1349
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:27,119
percent markup which that you get to

1350
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:30,890
your twenty four percent you get to

1351
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:33,180
twenty four percent number and then I

1352
00:55:30,889 --> 00:55:36,449
charged the excise tax and it's on the

1353
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:38,009
invoice the dispensary remits it to the

1354
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:39,838
distributor and then we take it and then

1355
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:42,680
we remit it to California Department tax

1356
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:42,679
and fee Administration

1357
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:52,789
we made up our own invoices that are

1358
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:54,710
compliant we ran them by BCC so he's

1359
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:57,739
asking there are some kind of sample

1360
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:59,420
invoices out there sample manifest I

1361
00:55:57,739 --> 00:56:02,568
just want to be sure we have time to get

1362
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:06,619
to all because I will go deep in the

1363
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:09,679
weeds on tax questions that is a tangled

1364
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:12,619
mess of hell so the gentleman in the

1365
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,808
back has a question so the question was

1366
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,490
can you set up a sandbox to enter the

1367
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:21,319
metric system and kind of play around

1368
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:24,348
with it we have entered a sandbox River

1369
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:26,358
has but there's really not much on

1370
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:28,309
distribution it's all about cultivation

1371
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:30,500
so even though we're in the sandbox

1372
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:32,480
there's really nothing for us to see

1373
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:34,460
yeah I mean Fran well the company that

1374
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,829
created metrics my understanding was

1375
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:39,440
made to track blueberries in Florida I

1376
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:43,490
mean that was what this software was

1377
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,519
created for it it was never intended to

1378
00:56:43,489 --> 00:56:49,789
be a cannabis tracking software and it

1379
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:53,210
certainly never envisioned the maturity

1380
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:56,019
and complexity in on Genuity of a

1381
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:59,088
California cannabis marketplace so

1382
00:56:56,019 --> 00:57:01,489
there's so many aspects of this software

1383
00:56:59,088 --> 00:57:03,230
being pushed to do things that it was

1384
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:06,439
not necessary I mean it definitely was

1385
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:09,619
not designed to do and it has not been

1386
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:12,289
contemplated yet it's amazing when the

1387
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:14,900
regulatory agencies were first releasing

1388
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:19,460
some of their application materials but

1389
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:22,818
they had no idea how complex just the

1390
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:25,190
product outputs were I think the first

1391
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:30,079
thing they had it was like concentrates

1392
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:31,579
shatter vapes that was it there was this

1393
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,089
like they're like what else do you do

1394
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:34,430
with it

1395
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:37,009
and so it's just the learning curve that

1396
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:39,169
we're in and I have a lot of empathy for

1397
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:41,329
the agencies as well they thought they

1398
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:43,909
had a three year period of time to roll

1399
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:45,349
out a medical plan and then prop 64

1400
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:48,649
happened and it was like oh by the way

1401
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:53,088
January you need to do this so it's been

1402
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:55,430
a rush job on all levels in in the

1403
00:57:53,088 --> 00:57:56,880
active people who are the operators

1404
00:57:55,429 --> 00:57:58,858
having to navigate

1405
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,269
system with them are the ones who are

1406
00:57:58,858 --> 00:58:02,538
the guinea pigs and suffer the

1407
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:05,489
consequences of all of these changes

1408
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:07,769
that's a really good point you know when

1409
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:10,288
when prop 64 came along I was working

1410
00:58:07,768 --> 00:58:11,879
for the BOE and I was thinking hey we

1411
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:13,410
just worked on these medical laws we got

1412
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,210
them passed we're gonna let these roll

1413
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:17,429
out we're gonna get right regulations

1414
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:20,460
we're gonna see how they work and then

1415
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:22,949
all of a sudden you know prop 64 and

1416
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:26,009
then we're like oh shit it's gonna pass

1417
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:27,449
it so we're gonna have two separate

1418
00:58:26,009 --> 00:58:29,519
systems we're gonna have a medical and

1419
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:31,018
we're gonna have a W system which we did

1420
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:33,929
for a while until they merged them all

1421
00:58:31,018 --> 00:58:36,959
together and the Senate bill 94 and some

1422
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:38,818
other trailer bills so and that's where

1423
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,858
I would like to see us stop focusing on

1424
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:42,778
the competition that we've that's been

1425
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:46,108
the business game for so many years and

1426
00:58:42,778 --> 00:58:47,489
really rely on each other right now to

1427
00:58:46,108 --> 00:58:49,048
really move forward there is gonna be

1428
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:51,268
enough business for all of you I promise

1429
00:58:49,048 --> 00:58:54,329
as an operator like there's enough for

1430
00:58:51,268 --> 00:58:57,000
all of you and we need to work together

1431
00:58:54,329 --> 00:58:59,640
to make this happen thank you

1432
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,500
because it truly is art as the big issue

1433
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:03,750
right now beating each other up

1434
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,690
I work in Sacramento and I see these

1435
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:08,730
freakin wars we have with one another

1436
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:11,039
but joy and like I mean it's just

1437
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:12,838
ridiculous come on like let's get over

1438
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:18,869
it and work together this gentleman over

1439
00:59:12,838 --> 00:59:20,460
here don't be this guy I don't know if

1440
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:25,588
anybody recognizes the guy in the front

1441
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:29,940
of the shirt yeah who is that what's

1442
00:59:25,588 --> 00:59:32,278
this guy's name yeah don't be that guy

1443
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:34,170
trying to push all your competition off

1444
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:37,289
the cliff while everybody is in this

1445
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:39,269
very perilous situation I mean med men

1446
00:59:37,289 --> 00:59:41,700
is going around there handing out cards

1447
00:59:39,268 --> 00:59:47,548
in front of every other they're going on

1448
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:49,558
to weed maps and Leafly and basically

1449
00:59:47,548 --> 00:59:52,889
seeing which competition is low on

1450
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:55,500
products and they're sending street

1451
00:59:52,889 --> 01:00:00,088
teams to basically swarm those

1452
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:02,909
dispensaries and hand fliers out drive

1453
01:00:00,088 --> 01:00:05,880
their Med men distribution trucks around

1454
01:00:02,909 --> 01:00:08,489
to basically take their business while

1455
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,030
they're at their weakest point that is a

1456
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:14,909
fuckin shitty practice

1457
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:18,300
and I'm calling it out and don't any of

1458
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:25,379
you do what they do compete fight but do

1459
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:27,780
it in the right way so the question was

1460
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:31,710
can we provide clarity as to sampling

1461
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:34,170
along all of the supply chain I can give

1462
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:37,470
you an example what we do at River as

1463
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:39,269
far as sampling so and we've ran this by

1464
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:41,159
the regulator's by the taxation

1465
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:43,230
officials and I say taxation officials

1466
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:47,210
because there's tax implications to

1467
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:52,619
samples so what we do is we sell samples

1468
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:55,530
not for resale to retailers for a very

1469
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:57,119
discounted price and we've gotten

1470
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:59,070
clarification from California Department

1471
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:02,159
tax and fee Administration that those

1472
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:05,670
products are not under the excise tax

1473
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:08,009
regime so they're under the sales and

1474
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:10,289
use tax regime so we charge themselves

1475
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:12,750
in use tax whatever that is whatever

1476
01:01:10,289 --> 01:01:18,840
locality they're in so that's how we

1477
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:21,449
handle samples essentially at River no

1478
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:23,430
but in that situation because we're

1479
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:26,189
making the sell to the retailer as the

1480
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:27,899
distributor were we're responsible for

1481
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:30,000
collecting that sales and use tax and

1482
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,410
remitting it to the state so that was a

1483
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,329
very that was one of the issues that

1484
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:35,369
came up right away if it's like cave we

1485
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:37,769
provided samples to retailers like hey

1486
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:40,199
this is our new latest brand you know we

1487
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:43,550
want to promote then well you can't give

1488
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:45,960
away cannabis goods for free anymore so

1489
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:48,240
you know I think we kind of divide I'm

1490
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,530
not gonna say it was you know the we

1491
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:51,629
were the first people thought of it we

1492
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:53,970
thought of this idea of discounted

1493
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:57,420
sample products not for resale with a

1494
01:01:53,969 --> 01:01:58,409
clear sticker and you know getting on

1495
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,389
track and trace that we're gonna be able

1496
01:01:58,409 --> 01:02:02,489
to do that I don't know is there gonna

1497
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:05,159
be a queue for not not for resale and

1498
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:08,099
that's the situation for us as as a

1499
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:11,839
buyer for stores as how the days of

1500
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:14,039
samples like we're not there anymore

1501
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,050
which is also great though because we

1502
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:17,940
also have I know what your lab testing

1503
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:19,590
is you I know what your pesticide

1504
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:22,960
testing all of these things that before

1505
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:24,010
you know I I knew a guy that knew a guy

1506
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,929
you know and so it's a lot more

1507
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,670
respectful as far as how they're coming

1508
01:02:25,929 --> 01:02:29,859
at it in the industry yes everything is

1509
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:31,570
coming in to me in sample form but it's

1510
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,579
coming in to me and an invoice because

1511
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:35,289
everything has to be tracking traced if

1512
01:02:33,579 --> 01:02:37,360
not then these companies would just be

1513
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:38,409
like it's diversion and itself like oh

1514
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,490
we're gonna make all this product and

1515
01:02:38,409 --> 01:02:40,809
call it samples and we're still gonna

1516
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:43,119
enter into our metric track and trace

1517
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:44,710
that's not gonna float because how are

1518
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,210
you gonna take all this product and

1519
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:47,860
eventually move it down here and then

1520
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:49,059
some of its gonna have to be moved into

1521
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:50,920
samples you're not gonna know what that

1522
01:02:49,059 --> 01:02:53,079
is from the beginning so it needs to

1523
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,880
come in to me with an invoice and so

1524
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:57,969
that I can I just go ahead and enter it

1525
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,220
into my system right now as sample you

1526
01:02:57,969 --> 01:03:02,919
know floor Cal this you know when I get

1527
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:04,719
it from River so that I'm able to just

1528
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,369
go ahead and allocate that that out it

1529
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:08,500
moves through my cut track and trace and

1530
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:10,299
bam it is now sold and out of my system

1531
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:12,550
and it has been paid its taxes the whole

1532
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,930
way through and so that's how we you

1533
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:15,940
have to move forward with samples in

1534
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:17,649
it's not a bad system it's a way for us

1535
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:19,030
to track and trace everything it's just

1536
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:21,190
not the old days where they could just

1537
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:23,530
throw down some eighths and some joints

1538
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:32,320
and and a vapor cartridge and edibles

1539
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:37,180
and I mean I mean that's what cannabis

1540
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:39,039
is for sir no and that's the whole

1541
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:41,049
purpose we want the we want the buyers

1542
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:43,449
and we want the bud tenders we want them

1543
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:45,789
to use that product so they can convey

1544
01:03:43,449 --> 01:03:47,379
that experience with but back to our

1545
01:03:45,789 --> 01:03:49,840
original theme I would say that this is

1546
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:52,570
an excellent area begging of your

1547
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:55,960
comments during this comment period the

1548
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:59,019
agencies have admitted they had a

1549
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:01,329
tremendous blind spot in oversight in

1550
01:03:59,019 --> 01:04:04,030
terms of any comprehension of the back

1551
01:04:01,329 --> 01:04:07,630
end actual sales process of what happens

1552
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:10,120
and how products get to the shelf the no

1553
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:13,390
free samples was intended as a consumer

1554
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:15,190
facing issue they never considered well

1555
01:04:13,389 --> 01:04:17,619
how does anybody know what they want to

1556
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:20,289
buy especially in a system where a

1557
01:04:17,619 --> 01:04:22,509
retailer cannot get their money back for

1558
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:25,389
a product that they buy and doesn't sell

1559
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:28,480
well they even cannot if the retailer

1560
01:04:25,389 --> 01:04:29,920
sells a vape cart to a consumer and then

1561
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,110
they find out it doesn't work the

1562
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,880
retailer is supposed to destroy it they

1563
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:35,269
can't send it back to the manufacturer

1564
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,039
distributor

1565
01:04:35,268 --> 01:04:38,568
them to say well I don't know let's find

1566
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,039
out what was wrong with it and let's do

1567
01:04:38,568 --> 01:04:41,688
some more research and wire our

1568
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:43,909
cartridges failing as it's written right

1569
01:04:41,688 --> 01:04:46,788
now in the regs the retailer would

1570
01:04:43,909 --> 01:04:49,130
destroy a defective product not be able

1571
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:51,140
to get return it for a replacement to

1572
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:53,298
the distributor so there's a lot of

1573
01:04:51,139 --> 01:04:56,418
holes in that area to look at in terms

1574
01:04:53,298 --> 01:04:58,429
of how should the sales process work

1575
01:04:56,418 --> 01:05:00,978
because you would think in a track and

1576
01:04:58,429 --> 01:05:03,199
trace system it's not that hard to have

1577
01:05:00,978 --> 01:05:05,148
a product category that's listed not for

1578
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:08,269
resale these are samples these are for

1579
01:05:05,148 --> 01:05:10,130
education these are for R&amp;D like those

1580
01:05:08,268 --> 01:05:13,008
things but they but you have to

1581
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:16,429
articulate the need for those solutions

1582
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:19,599
as an operator from the back end and one

1583
01:05:16,429 --> 01:05:22,219
of the issues on samples is so right now

1584
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,989
every sample I give you has to be state

1585
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:26,028
certified tested so it has to go through

1586
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:28,099
the whole process of state certified

1587
01:05:26,028 --> 01:05:29,809
testing you know I mean it's like this

1588
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:31,189
is one of the on the comment period this

1589
01:05:29,809 --> 01:05:32,869
is a huge issue and thanks for bringing

1590
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:34,759
that up I mean that's that's a huge

1591
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:37,130
issue we need to deal with how are we

1592
01:05:34,759 --> 01:05:40,099
going to promote these products we have

1593
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:42,019
to we can't just like I can't just like

1594
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:43,939
drop off a bunch of product at your

1595
01:05:42,018 --> 01:05:46,248
dispensary and say here sell a it

1596
01:05:43,938 --> 01:05:48,048
doesn't work that way we want to know

1597
01:05:46,248 --> 01:05:49,908
what the products like the experience

1598
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:51,949
you know the quality what does it look

1599
01:05:49,909 --> 01:05:53,179
like what does the flower look like yeah

1600
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:54,409
and you're you're absolutely right

1601
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:56,389
there's only a certain amount of

1602
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:57,439
products that can be given back to a

1603
01:05:56,389 --> 01:05:59,088
distributor return and that's

1604
01:05:57,438 --> 01:06:01,518
manufacturer products that are defective

1605
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:03,619
that's it you can't return flower you

1606
01:06:01,518 --> 01:06:04,158
can't do anything I mean it's very very

1607
01:06:03,619 --> 01:06:08,088
limited

1608
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:10,338
I believe that's almost all the time we

1609
01:06:08,088 --> 01:06:13,938
have do we have any more burning

1610
01:06:10,338 --> 01:06:14,748
questions from summer oh yes hello I see

1611
01:06:13,938 --> 01:06:17,088
you up front

1612
01:06:14,748 --> 01:06:19,418
I'm just shielding myself from this

1613
01:06:17,088 --> 01:06:19,418
bright

1614
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:33,199
the biggest issue that I found that the

1615
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:34,460
question was from the manufacturers

1616
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:37,098
perspective is there an amount that

1617
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:40,400
you're required to charge the biggest

1618
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:43,250
issue is the taxes they don't care if

1619
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,579
you sell it for a penny it all depends

1620
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:48,079
on how the taxes are brought through the

1621
01:06:45,579 --> 01:06:51,019
process and it might be depending on who

1622
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:53,450
you talk to it the CDC of a you know

1623
01:06:51,018 --> 01:06:56,929
there's been different versions of this

1624
01:06:53,449 --> 01:07:00,018
so for a full sized sample that's

1625
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:02,118
exactly the same thing as a retail

1626
01:07:00,018 --> 01:07:04,159
sample they may want to see the full

1627
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:07,910
excise tax carry through for that

1628
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:12,259
product so it's it's really important to

1629
01:07:07,909 --> 01:07:14,568
clarify with the tax agency what they

1630
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:16,190
are gonna want to see and to and to run

1631
01:07:14,568 --> 01:07:18,440
that by them to make sure that you're

1632
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:20,599
doing that in a compliant way because

1633
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:23,329
the agencies will be like sure penny

1634
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:25,338
programs go for it but but it's the tax

1635
01:07:23,329 --> 01:07:27,650
piece because if you're doing that wrong

1636
01:07:25,338 --> 01:07:30,880
the CDT FA has stated they're gonna

1637
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:33,200
consider that tax fraud CD T FA is also

1638
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,329
implementing their own regulations as

1639
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:37,098
well so you gotta watch those we're

1640
01:07:35,329 --> 01:07:39,680
talking about BCC and all these other

1641
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:42,880
three the three main regulating agencies

1642
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:45,139
well CD T a CD T FA at this time is also

1643
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,088
working through the regulatory process

1644
01:07:45,139 --> 01:07:48,828
because they are under an emergency

1645
01:07:47,088 --> 01:07:50,630
regulations process right now and

1646
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:53,420
they're adopting their final regulations

1647
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:55,818
on cannabis so pay attention to that as

1648
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:59,420
well be forewarned I had a client that

1649
01:07:55,818 --> 01:08:01,579
had CD t fa show up for an audit so they

1650
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:03,230
are doing that as well the other

1651
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:05,028
agencies you always want to be thinking

1652
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:08,449
about if you're a cultivator the water

1653
01:08:05,028 --> 01:08:11,150
boards and the California Department of

1654
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:13,399
Fish &amp; Wildlife are chomping at the bit

1655
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:16,039
they have been waiting impatiently to

1656
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,779
regulate this industry so they're

1657
01:08:16,039 --> 01:08:21,439
they're off to the races

1658
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:23,739
if you're a cultivator make them your

1659
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,738
friend

1660
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:40,649
