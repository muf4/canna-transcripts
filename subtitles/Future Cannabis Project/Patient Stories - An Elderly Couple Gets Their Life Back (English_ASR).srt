1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,130
Montana was a unique opportunity because

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:10,919
there there issuances medical carts were

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,610
so restrictive that the people who got

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:16,800
cards were truly sick

5
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:21,570
there was no chronic pain

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,118
there was no PTSD Montana was unique and

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,579
it's its program and that they were so

8
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,278
highly restrictive that the patients who

9
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,979
came to our door were all truly truly

10
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:35,399
truly truly sick you know people coming

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:40,649
to us with baskets of drugs I am on

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:43,500
these 24 pills every day how do I get

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:48,270
off of them and we helped so many people

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,549
do that it was just amazing and one of

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,300
my favorite stories of all time in our

16
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:58,259

conversation worth a with my wife

42
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,270

43
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,610
out on the patio in the rocking chair

44
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,950
watching the sunset and she's talking

45
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:25,300
yeah like she used to talk to me 10

46
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:30,289
years ago and she's smoking her pipe and

47
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,060
totally animated and engaged and she

48
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:35,298
walked back in the house and I sat there

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:38,330
in tears I had my wife back so I came

50
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:44,120
here today to tell you that you're not

51
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:46,820
and thank you and I mean I'm

52
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,489
saying they're going wow I didn't just

53
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:52,519
help her I helped the family you know

54
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:57,769
the family is better off because of what

55
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:59,390
we did for her you know that was what

56
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:01,730
you're doing in your agriculture

57
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:04,309
practices what we're championing is the

58
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:06,530
tip of the regenerative expir that will

59
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,680
influence the whole industry in the next

60
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,479
10 to 20 years yeah it'll be uh it's

61
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,659
something that needs to happen because

62
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:17,659
Vince draining of our water the salting

63
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:19,909
of our fields and I mean I suck because

64
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:22,780
I'm a farmer and I understand salts and

65
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:29,000
and it's easy and it's quick and it's an

66
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:33,459
instant fix and I get it from both sides

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,590
you know that yes using them long term

68
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:42,259
contaminates our soil but I'm down to a

69
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:43,969
quarter of what a normal farmer would do

70
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:46,699
you know and I mean I'm

71
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:50,780
still I'm using alfalfa pellets and it's

72
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:54,039
another thing I'm using in my soil so

73
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,849
you know I'm creating a rich soil of

74
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:57,849
nutrient based solution
