1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
all right Thank You Gretchen I'm Adrian

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:07,049
Adrian Giovinco CEO and co-founder of

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,918
inspired inspiration solutions thank you

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,570
for the opportunity to share some

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,820
information with you guys today let's

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,910
jump in on the next slide we learned

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,429
earlier from Corinne that light plus co2

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,439
plus water equals the sugar and oxygen

9
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,239
that we're looking for the plants need

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,730
to make sugar because this is plant food

11
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,890
and if you can't do this effectively

12
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,339
plants suffer and your outcomes will

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,140
suffer in the facility so when the

14
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:33,479
people who work with plants tell us that

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,820
there are nine cardinal parameters we

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,849
must remember that co2 and light are

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,399
only two of the nine important things

18
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,189
for plant growth and vitality as

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,960
providers of HVAC systems we designed

20
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,349
equipment knowing that we had direct

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,850
control over four of the nine parameters

22
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,679
the ones we highlighted in the circle on

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,660
the left side of the slide but

24
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,600
indirectly we affect the four parameters

25
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,038
in the root zone and even more

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,570
importantly if you want to take

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,829
advantage of the investment that you've

28
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,228
made in your lights and the full

29
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,849
spectrum of photons they provide you

30
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:08,159
ideally want to have the healthiest

31
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:11,099
plants to do so now all of this comes

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,439
down to the environment we take it so

33
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,140
seriously because we recognize that

34
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:19,500
environmental control is cultural

35
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,710
control and in the backbone of an IPM or

36
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,650
integrated pest management plan is

37
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:28,379
environmental control you know our team

38
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,530
has a mantra and that is you must

39
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:34,679
control the culture or the culture will

40
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,900
control you and managing your

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,470
environment correctly will prevent a

42
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,090
whole host of more costly interventions

43
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,840
and we just heard a little bit from

44
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,850
Chris about the importance of

45
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,100
biosecurity mindset we can talk about

46
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:52,530
that a little bit more and dig deeper

47
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:55,289
into it but something that's that's so

48
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,599
so important in this case you can truly

49
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,210
say that an ounce of prevention is worth

50
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,000
a pound of cure or in this case cured

51
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,859
bud let's move to the next slide and

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,259
discuss the importance of temperature it

53
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,810
is significant because the actual plant

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,120
cells will thrive in a narrow band of

55
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,800
temperature and outside that they'll

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,409
assimilate less and less of that

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,689
Rush's co2 that they need to drive the

58
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,129
sugar making process but keep in mind

59
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,020
that leaf temperature and room

60
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:24,359
temperature are sometimes two very

61
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,460
different things so how to growers

62
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,440
balance the room environment to control

63
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,170
the leaf temperature let's move to the

64
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,000
next slide and take a look

65
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:35,069
so most sophisticated growers will use a

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,530
VPD chart which is the chart on the Left

67
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,259
let's start with some definitions a

68
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,500
plant will move water through the root

69
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:46,590
system up the stem into the leaves and

70
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,379
out of tiny pores on the leaves the

71
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,569
pores are called stomata this process is

72
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,250
called transpiration and is driven by

73
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,009
the fact that just inside of the leaves

74
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:59,879
on the other side of the stomata our

75
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:01,829
saturated wet pockets of air the high

76
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,599
humidity inside the plant creates a

77
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,360
pressure with the external environment

78
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,129
which is at a lower humidity and this

79
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,860
pressure is called the vapor pressure

80
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:13,439
differential or vapor pressure

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,920
difference or vapor pressure deficit or

82
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,659
differential all abbreviated as VPD in

83
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,879
this case difference differential

84
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:23,250
deficit mean the same thing when you

85
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,289
hear that we can take a leaf at a

86
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,330
specific temperature and set of

87
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,479
temperature and humidity conditions and

88
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,780
generate the VPD metric most typically

89
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:36,269
calculated in Pascal's to measure that

90
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,180
pressure and now sophisticated grower

91
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,890
uses this this particular chart to

92
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,260
maintain try to maintain a temperature

93
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,349
and humidity most conducive to the stage

94
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:48,599
of life that the plan is in as a

95
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:50,370
mechanical engineer we use a similar

96
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,319
tool called the psychrometric chart

97
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,219
which is this chart on the right to

98
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,680
design an environment that delivers the

99
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,509
VPD to the grower that that is we

100
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,180
deliver an environment that allows the

101
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:05,429
plants to have a VPD that is suitable

102
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,670
for it's appropriate stage of growth and

103
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,159
in doing so delivers maximum vitality

104
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:12,719
and yield now take note that the axes on

105
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,449
both charts have temperature and

106
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,250
relative humidity which allow for these

107
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:19,680
charts to be used together in

108
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,988
conjunction now moving from the

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,060
theoretical this chart can often be Mis

110
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,189
applied by people who don't understand

111
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,418
that the VPD chart is not a static

112
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:30,658
diagram

113
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:32,430
in fact it starts by knowing that the

114
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:35,188
temperature of the leaf relative to the

115
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,379
room around it and this is most directly

116
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:39,150
impacted by the type of lighting that

117
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,789
serves the plant let's move to the next

118
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:43,620
slide and look at this in practice this

119
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:45,870
VPD chart is drawn on the condition

120
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,319
whereby the room temperature and the

121
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,329
leaf temperature are the same this is

122
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,370
usually indicative of a room at night

123
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:56,339
where there are no lights shining on the

124
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,740
plants let's move to the next slide and

125
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:00,388
this is a VPD chart showing optimal

126
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,449
conditions for a plant when it is

127
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,579
exposed to LED lights take note that in

128
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:08,069
this case the leaf temperature is cooler

129
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:11,579
than the room temperature or in practice

130
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:14,870
with the HVAC D systems the room

131
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:16,709
temperature is held on the warmer side

132
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,788
let's move to the next slide

133
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:22,228
and look at a VPD chart showing optimal

134
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:25,228
conditions for a plant when it is

135
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:27,180
exposed to HID lights here the leaf

136
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:29,938
temperature is warmer than the room

137
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,819
temperature or in practice with the HVAC

138
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:35,460
D system the room temperature is held on

139
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,348
the cooler side now can you see the

140
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,209
difference on how the chart is redrawn

141
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:40,889
each time we've gone through that

142
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:43,978
exercise between those three different

143
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:46,560
charts the really the real point to

144
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:49,408
drive home here hang on one sec the real

145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,918
point to drive home here is that VPD is

146
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:54,088
a moving target in any room and it

147
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,878
really requires a deeper understanding

148
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:58,918
than what a downloaded VPD chart off the

149
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,750
internet and taking that and treating it

150
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,028
like gospel what would allow you to do

151
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,038
now thankfully growers are coming around

152
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:06,449
to understanding this and can use or

153
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,269
horticultural specific environmental

154
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:11,699
control systems to bring dynamic VPD to

155
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:13,588
their rooms let's move to the next slide

156
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:17,669
and talk about the significance of data

157
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:21,360
metrics and KPIs it's so important to be

158
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:23,848
able to take advantage of data and learn

159
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,120
from data but if you don't have a funnel

160
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:30,088
and a means of taking that data turning

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,949
it into metrics and ultimately KPIs for

162
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:37,699
your business to be to be benchmarked on

163
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:40,620
and be able to take actionable

164
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,949
Corrections or you know direction from

165
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,530
that

166
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:46,069
data you know what was then that purpose

167
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:49,289
of gathering that data right so

168
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:51,180
benchmarking is a key function in in

169
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,100
figuring out where you start from and

170
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,470
where you're at and then you can use

171
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,530
different types of these metrics and

172
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,240
KPIs whether it's grams per watt dollars

173
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:02,429
per gram operating cost per pound

174
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,199
condensate capture over total water

175
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,060
things like this from a high level

176
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,250
cultivator perspective and business

177
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,899
owner perspective and the lighting side

178
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,379
we can talk about micro moles per Joule

179
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:16,889
for us on the HVAC D side we talk about

180
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:19,949
pounds per hour of moisture removal per

181
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,800
kW of electricity that it cost to remove

182
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:27,269
that that moisture and it's such a more

183
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,840
impactful metric than tons of cooling

184
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:33,169
type metric let's move on to the next

185
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,810
slide and talk about some HVAC design

186
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:41,069
considerations you know this is a as

187
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,750
Chris from live well documented it's

188
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:44,219
come up a number of times through the

189
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,500
through the panel today this is a

190
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,390
moisture removal challenge not an air

191
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,160
conditioning challenge and knowing

192
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:52,769
knowing that and knowing that it is

193
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,410
really based upon understanding your

194
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:58,199
actual daily watering rates is such a

195
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,689
key component and we'll talk a little

196
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,099
bit about sizing in a second room

197
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,689
conditions are key to that because

198
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,090
different as we just talked about

199
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:09,660
different types of lighting systems

200
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:12,060
require different room conditions and

201
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:16,320
then those as such then those those room

202
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,740
conditions have a either in at positive

203
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,930
or negative affect D rating or

204
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,720
increasing the capacity of any given

205
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,400
HVAC system based upon what those room

206
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,870
conditions are and the amount of

207
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,629
moisture that you that you wish to

208
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,610
remove air flow considerations have just

209
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,799
been touched on significantly in the

210
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,860
last couple especially with Chris who

211
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,449
league which is which is Graham just

212
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,149
consistent clean trying to remove

213
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,560
microclimates airflow over is really one

214
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,049
of those things that can can

215
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,019
significantly positively impact your

216
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:51,209
facility with with not a whole lot else

217
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,100
to it if you're having big challenges

218
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,660
and I'm really glad that he talked about

219
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,278
biosecurity that's

220
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,019
you know of course all of these topics

221
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:01,559
are things we could have much deeper

222
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:05,220
dives on so just to quickly flash up for

223
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,929
you a what we use as a basis of figuring

224
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,680
out the pounds per hour of moisture

225
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:12,750
removal to size HVAC equipment so pounds

226
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,669
per hour it is truly the daily watering

227
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,919
rate times the percentage of moisture

228
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:19,229
removed during the day divided by the

229
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,328
number of photo period on hours and then

230
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,060
converting from gallons to pounds four

231
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:26,188
of water and this is just a graph

232
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,438
that'll give you an example of a

233
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:31,139
particular particular room we go to the

234
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:33,328
next slide this is really important you

235
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,159
know what we're advocates for growers to

236
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:36,750
know and understand this equation and be

237
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:39,028
able to be an active participant in the

238
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,399
design of their systems but with any

239
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:43,230
ruler equation really comes nuances and

240
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,730
exceptions to the rules and an

241
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,519
understanding that there's different

242
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,159
rooms different you know bedrooms versus

243
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,110
flower rooms versus mother rooms also

244
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,909
different proportion who will have

245
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,289
different proportions as well as

246
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:57,088
different crops will have different

247
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:59,278
proportions is very very important to

248
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,480
understand that let's recap on the next

249
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,049
in the last slide and give you a few

250
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,610
nuggets to take away to the Q&amp;A section

251
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:08,068
cultural control is the foundation of

252
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,159
success we really are big believers in

253
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:13,799
that and the environmental control via

254
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:17,879
the HVAC D system D for dehumidification

255
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:19,889
is key to any IPM strategy the third

256
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:22,470
bullet here of different HVAC D systems

257
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:25,799
system types we could go into another

258
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,420
multi minute our conversation about all

259
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,549
the different types of systems it's

260
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,588
mostly important to understand that

261
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:33,389
there's many different types of HVAC

262
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,399
systems out there and then it's really

263
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:37,649
important to be able to evaluate the

264
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,568
limitations and risk of different types

265
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:41,730
of systems be able to look at different

266
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:43,740
types of energy savings features work

267
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:48,089
that in conjunction with your utility

268
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,129
early and often as mentioned earlier and

269
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,379
then be able to balance that with capex

270
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:55,169
op X and cash flow in your speed to

271
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:57,300
market plan I'll just leave you with you

272
00:10:55,169 --> 00:11:00,299
know we advocate for choosing your

273
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,889
partners with care and we always want to

274
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:05,568
say to treat those plants with respect

275
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:05,568
and have fun thank you
