[Music]

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,440
i'm shane mosley and i'm with glass

3
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:12,750
house farms in Santa Barbara County

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,789
I'm Brian Malin vital garden supply and

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,259
vital grown vital garden supplies

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:20,730
headquarters is Nevada City California

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:39,739
and vital grown farm is in Willis

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:39,739
California Mendocino County but I traded

9
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:44,250
that's that's an epic one that's an

10
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,019
old-school you know it's funny is I

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:53,070
actually the plant that we have in our

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:56,010
booth yeah that's cool that's I think

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,350
that's like a really easy place to start

14
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:59,849
with we don't we know we know we don't

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,530
know each other but as cultivars that's

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,109
that's an easy one to go back is like

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,390
just some old school strains like when I

18
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,549
started growing I could probably name

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,060
all the strains on my fingers and toes

20
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:15,299
you know and pretty much everything has

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,600
come from there since then right no I

22
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,630
mean I went on Leafly and I think there

23
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:27,750
was a close to 5,000 strains listed on

24
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:29,099
there that's like get out of here I

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,739
wonder how many of those have the

26
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,569
original og cush as a backbone of it

27
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,060
because there's a lot of Kush heavy

28
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:39,239
strains and I'm pretty sure that the

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,509
world loves that OG Kush fuel flavor

30
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:45,259
yeah it's not that gassy mercy interpret

31
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,659
feel like dot Durbin poison like you do

32
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:50,250
a lot of yeah those all those crosses

33
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,868
well the gelatos are from their pushes

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,769
too right there pure fucking Hindu yes

35
00:01:53,868 --> 00:02:00,578
yeah it's good stuff yeah very

36
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:00,578
interesting times

37
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:17,419
we have a few we have several strange

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,680
some gelatos some we drew a bunch of

39
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:20,780
skittles actually that's what this jar

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,150
is right here that's some depth skittles

41
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,699
right there so are you pulling your

42
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,780
point like four turns probably really

43
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:29,479
only three because of the elevation

44
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,848
we're also like no electricity up there

45
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,969
we're bringing power in so we're still

46
00:02:31,848 --> 00:02:37,669
like crafts Towe cannabis farm and we're

47
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:40,310
also you know at the at the mercy of

48
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:42,378
PG&amp;E so you know what happened with all

49
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,780
the fires and all that because of all

50
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:48,318
that everybody's like backlog and

51
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,789
bringing power into properties so due to

52
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,889
that we're running generators just to

53
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:54,289
keep plants alive and vegging during the

54
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:56,628
early parts of the spring late parts of

55
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:57,858
the winter so this one it was very

56
00:02:56,628 --> 00:03:00,620
interesting because it just kept going

57
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:02,269
on and on and on so it just gave that

58
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,030
everything a little bit of a push back

59
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:07,340
as far as like timeframes go that's uh

60
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,650
when I got here yesterday when I got

61
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,810
here yesterday I was laughing about that

62
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,310
you just diesel everybody's got transfer

63
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,689
tanks I miss it moving down to suck I

64
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,068
was like you know you're back in NorCal

65
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,539
cuz everybody has a transfer tank you

66
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:19,759
got to get that generator going it's

67
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:22,340
good stuff for sure it's been a way of

68
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:25,568
life for a long time now but we're

69
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,759
looking forward to having power I mean

70
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:31,208
talking before like for 20 years you

71
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,759
basically just sold locally to go

72
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,769
outside

73
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:39,669
so in terms of like you surviving as a

74
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:42,639
company and a brand and a farmer well

75
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:45,098
not you can concentric Li start with

76
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,030
your home turn my well my situation is a

77
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:47,709
little different than a lot of the other

78
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,169
farmers because I'm also in the nutrient

79
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,789
business so I've always been on the

80
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,578
nutrient side of things supplied a lot

81
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:59,108
of grows black market back in the day

82
00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:01,329
then the gray market medical and being

83
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:02,530
being that I love the plan so much and

84
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,290
wanting to be involved is that I always

85
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,090
had my backyard grows and different

86
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:09,759
situations helping out different friends

87
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,530
and and then you know once things came

88
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,108
to be then I was like well I need to

89
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,089
have a piece of this you know beginning

90
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:18,340
of history you know the cannabis

91
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,619
industry began here in Northern

92
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,198
California at least for the u.s. anyway

93
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,538
I don't want to say began but the

94
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,538
culture from California cannabis in

95
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:30,158
Northern California is super strong and

96
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:32,439
because of my relationships and love for

97
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:34,870
the plan I felt it was important you

98
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:38,680
know enter the legal you know market

99
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:41,788
prop 64 and be able to sell licensed

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,788
recreational cannabis

101
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:50,159
absolutely I know we saw our dancin

102
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:58,769
organic organic soil fertilizer

103
00:04:50,160 --> 00:05:01,199
amendments yeah I make soil we have a

104
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:03,299
soil line that that has you know a bunch

105
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,160
of really good ingredients that is

106
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,770
something that we sell so people could

107
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,099
just plant right in it as far as like

108
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:13,168
history of building soil you know that

109
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:14,879
goes back to like the farmers who've

110
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:20,848
been doing this for many years reusing

111
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:24,538
the same soil amending it when you're up

112
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:27,120
on the hill literally trucking in soil

113
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:28,829
if you need it so the best way to do it

114
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,478
is do that once every three years or

115
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,649
whatever and amended twice and make sure

116
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,449
you know what you're doing and we've

117
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:36,269
been big on selling worm castings

118
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,069
compost houmous back one oh that's

119
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:41,158
that's been my backbone of what our

120
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:45,270
company is yeah I think that's like a

121
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:48,089
really big I don't know overlooked part

122
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:49,379
of old school growing is is the the kind

123
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,779
of had that mentality of they're just

124
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,819
just some dumb pot car up in the hill or

125
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,989
whatever right but they're still even

126
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:56,339
back then there's still a lot of science

127
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,900
to it you know and everybody that's

128
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,209
where the uniqueness of those strain

129
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:03,029
profiles comes from you're gonna get a

130
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:05,279
way more Turkey earthy strain like taste

131
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:08,008
wise to like because it was grown in a

132
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:13,109
certain way with a certain exactly my

133
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:15,240
culture exactly so that and that's so a

134
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,430
glass house were where the other end of

135
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,829
the model but I come from that

136
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,810
background in glassware 100% cocoa is

137
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:23,038
our medium and we usually nutrients but

138
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,930
it's the same thing

139
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,120
you find you've developed those recipes

140
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,680
same thing through with the strains and

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,810
that's how you really accentuate the

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,090
terpene profiles and and I think as

143
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,500
science kind of like develops a little

144
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:35,879
bit more we talked about this last time

145
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,930
that I really believe it's like

146
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:42,839
potencies a joke on how you get high

147
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,959
right like so many people are so locked

148
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,949
into the number what percentage of THC

149
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,699
this stuff probably only

150
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,979
like 18% right but it is you it'll get

151
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,240
you loaded and and but your metabolism

152
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,830
just like anything you know you have

153
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,269
your own endocannabinoid system and

154
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:00,039
that's what's that's what's really

155
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:01,930
regulating how you get high and the

156
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,900
combinations of the terpenes combined

157
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,560
with the percentage of THC and the CBD

158
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:11,079
in the CBG you know there's way more to

159
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,350
it than just the percentage of THC one

160
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:16,870
to I think with like the new market for

161
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,520
me at least when I see that's the new

162
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,180
market when I see that's where we get

163
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:25,269
like actually educating people you know

164
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,100
the goes back to the stereotype some

165
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:29,560
people are just like pot heads would

166
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:33,580
ever know no actual knowledge of the

167
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,740
plant that it's one incredibly powerful

168
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:37,089
but it's a medicine and it's just like a

169
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,949
pharmaceutical you got to go into that

170
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:42,310
like a budtender is basically a

171
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:44,139
pharmacist you know it's it's they need

172
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,329
to develop that would that person knows

173
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:48,669
what works to that person you can't the

174
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:50,229
old model of Steve will make you clean

175
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,720
your house and indica put you to sleep

176
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:55,060
is like it's got to go out the window we

177
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,890
got to figure out that it's individual

178
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,720
to each person especially with so many

179
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,269
high res right now between the hybrids

180
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,370
and the strains and the hybrids and the

181
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:04,539
humans you know we're all freaking

182
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,939
different and there's a million

183
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,990
different combinations of strains and

184
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:14,050
terpenes and CBD THC concoctions that

185
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,090
we're all different and it just goes to

186
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,730
show that what an amazing plant this is

187
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:21,219
and nobody's ever given any other plant

188
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,740
this much energy you know what I mean so

189
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,880
I feel really lucky to be in this place

190
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,310
right now for sure

191
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,889
cannabis is like it's getting its day

192
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,780
it's the it's in the Sun finally you

193
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,019
know after many years of hiding it in

194
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,019
the shade

195
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:56,620
so what are you trying to do we're

196
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,179
working on a little bit of breeding we

197
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,509
have a we have something that we've been

198
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:03,599
working on a few years now it's actually

199
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:06,330
cross with skittles and lemon tree and

200
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,339
we're just working the kinks out of it

201
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,379
doing Fino hunts every round and just

202
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,029
trying to find a few that we really like

203
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:15,220
before we really like get it out there

204
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:16,689
to develop there's there's signs of

205
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,070
things that were really seeing that are

206
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,870
positive but every now and then you'll

207
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:24,820
see one that does something that we're

208
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:29,830
not real happy with so if we oh just

209
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:32,528
like shapes of the flower or sculpture

210
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:36,000
the plant mold resistance exactly all

211
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:37,958
those he said it I mean breeding is like

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,669
greetings not really to be messed with

213
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,199
too much and that's it goes back to the

214
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:42,399
how many strains there are these days or

215
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,860
so many people that think that they

216
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,539
could read something and then that's a

217
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,950
strain and you just said it it's like

218
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:49,509
you need like three to five years of

219
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,000
running the same cut and maybe they're

220
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:54,789
it's breeding that's it's just like

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,339
otherwise in dogs they're called a mutt

222
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:59,049
if you just have two great it's not

223
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:01,270
another you didn't create a new breed of

224
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:03,458
dog I'm always amazed these days when

225
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,889
like a new strain comes the market and

226
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:07,869
it's like oh wow have you seen this and

227
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:10,360
then it's out and it's on the streets

228
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:13,209
and it's available and then before you

229
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,860
know it there's another across of that

230
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:17,979
and you're like wait has it even been

231
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,200
two months and that's change routes are

232
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:24,149
already rights and then white runts and

233
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:28,209
then purple runs who just go wait what

234
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:30,639
exactly so for me the breeding side of

235
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:33,458
things is like you know we're not a

236
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,110
genetics company but we obviously have

237
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,539
genetics that we really feel desirable

238
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,100
and when we hit that mark with that one

239
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:41,219
something that we really feel good about

240
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,720
and want to bring to the to the world

241
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,440
will let people know but we also don't

242
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,149
want to be premature about it

243
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,920
I mean my whole approach that everything

244
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,078
has always been from the high quality

245
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,789
side of things high-end vital garden

246
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:54,469
supply products aren't the cheapest

247
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:56,719
products on the market that are the best

248
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,209
products in the market and we that's our

249
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,810
approach for growing cannabis - we want

250
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:06,528
to have high-end quality high terpene

251
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:08,508
profiles different things that you don't

252
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:10,188
necessarily see everywhere right I feel

253
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:11,810
- like we've before we're on camera

254
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:13,159
meaning we're talking - that's more like

255
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,809
you're gonna get that from like the

256
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:16,039
legacy grower if you will fish you know

257
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:19,489
and I mean somebody that's been in it

258
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:22,039
for 15-20 years like us it's not it's

259
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,740
the other thing is the new the new guys

260
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:27,919
just worried about their their bottom

261
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,740
dollar it's actually not not that 100%

262
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,659
quality over everything that's that's

263
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,919
pretty good cuz it's your blood sweat

264
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,088
and tears because it used to be for us

265
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,778
right it used to be if you didn't make

266
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:40,129
it good your kids didn't need you know

267
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:41,899
you want to own it and you want to be

268
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:44,449
proud of it and say hey I did that yeah

269
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,370
please please for me for sure for sure

270
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:48,240
definitely back that that type of

271
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,298
thought for sure

272
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,298
[Music]

273
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:05,799
like what's going on sure well it's

274
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:08,090
definitely it's it's tricky right now

275
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,759
Mendocino County has a cap at ten

276
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:13,550
thousand square feet and everyone in

277
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,500
mindo who has a 10,000 square feet has

278
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:18,109
to compete with people in other areas

279
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,330
that may not have any caps or they could

280
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,899
be an acre cap or depending like

281
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:25,370
Humboldt County there's a few acre

282
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,929
projects a few people have up to even

283
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,700
four acres that I know of up there Lake

284
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:31,669
County's starting to get some multi

285
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,660
acreage licenses as well then of course

286
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:39,740
Santa Barbara

287
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:41,419
you know multi our current cultivate our

288
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,889
current cultivation is one hundred and

289
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:45,229
thirty four thousand square feet and

290
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:46,939
they just are about to start up are an

291
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,279
extra three hundred and fifty five

292
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:54,260
thousand square feet so a half a million

293
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:58,189
square feet it's like and that's I mean

294
00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:00,799
it is it's epic it's it's the dream yeah

295
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,180
but it's also challenging it's also

296
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,039
challenging right because that's also

297
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:06,739
the dream right that's that's the dream

298
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:09,379
for for tons of growers up there and but

299
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:12,560
the reiterating what he said I really

300
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:13,370
think that any of these legacy guys that

301
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,529
are in it all right

302
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,090
they have the chance because the quality

303
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,730
right he said the quality and the

304
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:22,310
consistency and knowing that you really

305
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,830
got a cut of OG as opposed to buying in

306
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:27,349
a cut of Gorilla Glue and it ends up

307
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,660
being Sour Diesel or something you know

308
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,600
because that that's a that's another big

309
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:34,370
thing is sourcing you know these days to

310
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,290
its it used to be you asked where that

311
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,250
came from and he came from a guy you

312
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:39,500
know and I'm gonna tell you where it

313
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,990
came from it came from from somebody and

314
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,730
but not actor source right and now you

315
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,549
go to a big nursery though you know so

316
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,379
it's there's a big change in that that

317
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:50,539
aspect of it too in terms of sourcing

318
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:52,909
sure and due to my relationship in the

319
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:55,069
industry I am a partner on a pretty big

320
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:56,659
project down in Salinas that's over two

321
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,060
hundred thousand square feet a specific

322
00:13:56,659 --> 00:14:01,069
reserve we have a hundred and forty six

323
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:04,549
thousand square foot all-in

324
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,290
area that's like a multi bay greenhouse

325
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:08,269
and then we also have a light assisted

326
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:10,549
one it has like six hundred lights and

327
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:12,199
it's like 40,000 square feet and that

328
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,870
were able to really put out some high

329
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,730
quality product Salinas being the

330
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,399
temperate zone that it's in it's like

331
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,170
you know a dream to be able to grow down

332
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,779
there and be part of that as well and

333
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:26,509
use some my products and show what you

334
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:28,699
can do on an organic large scale you

335
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:43,549
know and that's been a fun fun

336
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:45,770
relationship and fun project also we

337
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:48,589
definitely have several Salinas people

338
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:51,019
using a lot of our products some using

339
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,490
the full line some mixing in a little

340
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,009
bit of organics with a little bit of

341
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:58,340
synthetics some will use our soil and

342
00:14:55,009 --> 00:15:00,049
not and use different nutrients that's

343
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,509
the one thing about our product line is

344
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:05,209
it is diverse like we saw humic acid

345
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:08,269
that's good for synthetic or organ or

346
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:10,670
organic fertilizer we saw a calcium

347
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:13,220
magnesium that can be used synthetic or

348
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:14,569
organic it's certified but it would go

349
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,980
into any reservoir you could run it

350
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,160
through a drip system you can run it

351
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:26,560
through a dosing system and then our

352
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:26,559
soil is definitely pretty universal yeah

353
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:36,199
it's actually actually really with what

354
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,200
we use I really really like it you know

355
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,640
we use the elite line in nutrients and I

356
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,320
don't I don't know too much of the

357
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,240
science of our liner nutrients but it is

358
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,940
an organic based it's it's salt organic

359
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,769
right it's it's a mix basically but it's

360
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,960
an eight-part thing and and the results

361
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:53,899
have been have been phenomenal from what

362
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,670
I've seen and obviously obviously like I

363
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,740
mentioned before in recipes and certain

364
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:59,839
strain profiles is really where where it

365
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,840
shines right you get good results with

366
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,460
everything but there's certain terpene

367
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,860
profiles we've kind of broken it down

368
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,930
into gaseous fruits and sugars but

369
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,940
especially the sugars just love the

370
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,388
cocoa and the elite it's like I mean

371
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:17,179
that there

372
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:18,709
so so THC rich or try trike rich you

373
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:21,499
know what I mean just so sugary with the

374
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:24,349
cocoa like I said it is just so trike

375
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:26,298
rich and and fun to look at we have a

376
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,399
couple of cultivars particularly I've

377
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:29,869
mentioned you a hell's fire before that

378
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,839
I really like to grow and it's just it's

379
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:36,350
just so concise it's so consistent with

380
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:39,290
with that line so but but I grew I grew

381
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,540
in soil and you know organics and simple

382
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:45,469
mixes and complicated mixes for years

383
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:47,178
too and and personally I think that it

384
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,579
kind of just goes in line with how the

385
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:51,980
system is already I really like soil and

386
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:53,479
organics for big outdoor plants for you

387
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,489
know I'm for huge outdoor plants that's

388
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,259
to me that's the way to go but when

389
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:58,939
you're doing DEP or anything I do at

390
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:00,409
this point kind of prefer the cocoa

391
00:16:58,938 --> 00:17:02,360
because I like I said I don't have to

392
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:03,558
manage it as much really it's really

393
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,139
where it is to me it's like you know

394
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:08,000
what you gave it and that's it and then

395
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:11,990
if it's missing something easily

396
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,548
adjustable right that's another

397
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,068
beautiful thing about cannabis there's a

398
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:18,078
million ways to grow it and you got to

399
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:20,000
do what you're comfortable with you know

400
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,398
like by no means am I gonna tell this

401
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,949
guy that he's doing something wrong he's

402
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:29,268
grown in 300,000 square foot greenhouse

403
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:31,610
they've been successful so I respect any

404
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:33,200
sort of cultivation style if somebody

405
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:34,879
wants to come to me and reach out and

406
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,009
say hey I'd like to make some transition

407
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,500
into some organics and of course I'm

408
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:40,788
here for them but you know everyone's

409
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,769
got to do what they what works for them

410
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:45,589
I'm obviously a big believer in the

411
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:48,919
organic style and it works for me and

412
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:50,829
works for our farm and that's you know

413
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,240
that's the path we decided to choose

414
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:55,939
what are you getting the price per gram

415
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,970
down to in terms of cultivation costs

416
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,850
for a large scale greenhouse Santa

417
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:05,210
Barbara cultivation operation versus a

418
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:06,918
small Mendocino outdoor farm we're

419
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,919
working on figuring that out yours are

420
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,989
going to be

421
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:15,109
it depends I mean I think that I think

422
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:17,358
there's a little bit of a misconception

423
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:18,978
there I think people always think that

424
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:20,408
organic is more expensive than they

425
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:22,609
thought

426
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:24,049
depending on the nutrient depending on

427
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:26,358
the amounts of nutrients depending how

428
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:29,179
many times you feed a day I mean soil

429
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:31,398
holds nutrients so I mean we have grow

430
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,559
we have big grows that at Pacific

431
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:37,608
reserve they're feeding only twice a

432
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:40,128
week and they're they have soil that has

433
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:42,288
nutrients in the root zone all the time

434
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:44,778
so when you add water the plants getting

435
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,878
nutrient so they've actually gotten

436
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:48,829
their nutrient costs down quite a bit in

437
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:50,928
the beginning they were feeding 3 4

438
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:52,278
times a week and then they were worried

439
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,259
that it wasn't enough and then they

440
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:56,298
started bringing in some synthetics and

441
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,128
going back and forth and then they

442
00:18:56,298 --> 00:19:00,079
realized when they just cut back and

443
00:18:58,128 --> 00:19:02,298
became a little more minimalist they

444
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,668
were actually getting better results so

445
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:06,200
you know like I said every every

446
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:08,269
different person has to go with what

447
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,788
works for them they found a system that

448
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:13,519
works they have a couple dosatrons they

449
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:16,878
run humic they run calmac and they run a

450
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,950
grow and or bloom and that's it and they

451
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:22,009
do a foliar when the plants are young

452
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:25,129
they have a serious IPM schedule of

453
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:26,749
course right but you know like I said

454
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:28,728
that there's a million ways to skin a

455
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:30,679
cat and you'd be surprised how far

456
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:34,129
nutrient can go in an organic system

457
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,389
yeah the soil food web is is that that

458
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:36,798
goes back to me the soil food would be

459
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:39,048
saying outdoor that's why I'll always

460
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,230
loved it for outdoor because it's it is

461
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:44,259
its nature right it's a song

462
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,808
those big beautiful plants and and yeah

463
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:49,990
that like like you said it fit the guy

464
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:51,339
that the guy that's 65 and saying he

465
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,200
can't figure it out and he's been

466
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:54,939
growing for 45 years that's here that's

467
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,600
your real grower right the guy that's

468
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,679
like this is the only way you do it

469
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,250
that's stick-in-the-mud and that ain't

470
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,400
going anywhere

471
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,529
so I so resonate with that statement

472
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,630
that you know there's there's a million

473
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:11,168
ways to do it and it's and it's always

474
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:13,000
changing - you know it's cannabis that's

475
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:16,809
that's that's the beauty about it it's

476
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:26,319
it's it's an individual man it's got a

477
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:29,740
personality it's fun we we just finished

478
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:35,168
up depth and we're probably about four

479
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:36,910
weeks out from fall harvest right now

480
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:45,190
we're not we're not disappointed at all

481
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:47,890
last year is about half pretty close to

482
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,720
double yeah I think I you know I haven't

483
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,759
messed with outdoor in a while but I

484
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,220
think last year that was probably packs

485
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:58,480
going for like 700 bucks which is it I

486
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:00,789
mean I I can't even figure that out you

487
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:06,429
know I mean it's it's rough so hard to

488
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:08,109
pay the bills at that right this

489
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:10,660
tributes are aggressive in there being

490
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:14,649
very friendly for sure a lot of dm's

491
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:16,179
yeah yeah and for us it's different when

492
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,700
he knows - you like Pacific reserve I'm

493
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:21,610
sure we don't you know it's not not that

494
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:24,100
classic season right we're perpetual we

495
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:27,548
harvest we if you do the math we harvest

496
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:29,548
about once every six days perpetually I

497
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:31,808
think we're on our hundred and

498
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:33,220
thirtysomething harvest right now since

499
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:36,759
we've you know since we open the doors

500
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,009
almost two years ago so it's it's it's

501
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,329
ever going you know there's and we're

502
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:42,390
lucky to be in Santa Barbara County -

503
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:45,429
because the microclimate there is it's

504
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,470
very stable you know

505
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,049
it's not they're not a lot of huge

506
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,150
seasonality in terms of climate your

507
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,859
your your D Li is all that's really

508
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,540
seasonal you know your your light index

509
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:57,309
you're having a little bit there

510
00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:00,129
obviously you get less light in the

511
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:02,769
wintertime but same same kind of

512
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,270
microclimate all year round I have to

513
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:13,839
admit I am jealous of your weather down

514
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:16,329
there I mean I think there would have to

515
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,490
be like some alterations in the amounts

516
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:20,500
of water or things like that size pot I

517
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,349
mean I think it would still perform well

518
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,609
a little more humid down there so we'd

519
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:26,889
have to be a little bit more careful in

520
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:29,949
the oh geez that are sensitive and that

521
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,380
are potential to get p.m. but you know

522
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,890
being an experienced grower and growing

523
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,180
in multiple different places I think I'd

524
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,680
be able to figure it out right and

525
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,870
that's that's what we're saying too it

526
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,160
goes back to yeah it's cannabis it's

527
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:44,199
always gonna change you can never really

528
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:48,160
predict what its gonna do you can go and

529
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:51,039
try it and they take a round or two to

530
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,790
really hone it in but why are you

531
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,789
offering some space
