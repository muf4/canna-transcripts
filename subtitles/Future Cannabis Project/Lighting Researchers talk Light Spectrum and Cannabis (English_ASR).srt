1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,589
we spend a lot of time talking today so

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,989
I feel like I learned a lot about

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:18,420
solitude well a lot basically that it's

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,269
just a very very reflective duct work

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,310
and you can get a lot of sunlight into

7
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,910
your building excellent I've learned a

8
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:30,929
lot about just the the whole chemistry

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,789
between behind photosynthesis and plant

10
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,219
growth I really enjoyed your talk this

11
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,210
morning pretty fascinating yeah yeah I

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,308
appreciate that

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,049
so from the perspective of solar tube

14
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:42,658
know is there anything that you can

15
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,248
utilize in that like the sort of

16
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:46,198
horticultural space is relatively new

17
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:48,870
market for you it is and I'm anything

18
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:52,878
we're always learning about certainly

19
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:57,988
par how can we better calculate for par

20
00:00:52,878 --> 00:01:01,018
what you know how do we aid in the

21
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:03,088
horticultural space in properly

22
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:05,489
designing a system how do we account for

23
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:07,769
daylight how we use the the current

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,070
design tools and tweak them to you

25
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:12,810
support for that solitude they develop

26
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:14,489
the really good it's it's a daylight

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,719
calculator and I think I meant I heard

28
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,920
you mentioned it's not really convey

29
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:20,449
label commercially but you guys have a

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,159
DLI calculator sure yeah

31
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,530
dearly late integral tool right that we

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,740
can use and there are DLI Maps or D like

33
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,118
daily light integral maps available it

34
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:31,408
takes a bit of digging but you can find

35
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:31,828
these for all kinds of different parts

36
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,310
of the world

37
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:36,750
yeah and for different crops less so

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,740
with cannabis at this point but for all

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,590
these different crops there are

40
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:41,759
recommended DL eyes even down to just

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,200
like different developmental stages

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,030
right so one strategy is just trying to

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,590
hit that target D Li and for something

44
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,070
like whether its greenhouse or whether

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,240
it's a solution like like like so - one

46
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,758
challenge that you guys are gonna have

47
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,679
is just by virtue of the fact that you

48
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,179
are still reliant on sunlight they're

49
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:01,829
going to be parts of the days and

50
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:03,049
certainly times of the year when you're

51
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:05,759
really not getting enough sunlight

52
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:08,789
absolutely so we we have to work

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,939
cooperatively so I really see the the

54
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,500
synergy between our products and the

55
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:14,990
work that

56
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,270
and that the job done and how do we

57
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,040
merge everything together right to make

58
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,710
the most efficient system possible there

59
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,389
may address the needs of horticulture

60
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,830
and plant growth and I think that's

61
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,489
that's something that you really taught

62
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:31,040
me is I really didn't realize that the

63
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,629
plant required different spectra at

64
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,799
different points in its life never

65
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:34,400
really occurred to me it makes total

66
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,040
sense now

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,420
but I you know what what we'd like to do

68
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,519
what we were designing with the system

69
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,289
is the dynamic interplay between the

70
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,120
amount of sunlight that's available and

71
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:46,039
then your LEDs that are inside of the

72
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,659
room and it's it's interesting how often

73
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,849
people will get caught up on oh well

74
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:52,069
there's not enough sunlight the counter

75
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:53,750
to that is really any second you can

76
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,810
turn off the LEDs or turn them down

77
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,370
you're saving money your and so to a

78
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,199
certain extent you know if you're up in

79
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,659
Alaska and you know maybe if if you know

80
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,099
it's not completely dark for 24 hours

81
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:05,750
but if you're in Maine or you're way up

82
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,329
there you're gonna have less light you

83
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,860
rely on the LEDs more but it's less than

84
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,150
what you would be doing if it was a

85
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,160
hundred percent artificial light

86
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,230
absolutely right off that way yeah and I

87
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,500
think your idea to I think you had

88
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:22,189
explored augmenting the daylight spectra

89
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,769
you know and with your tunable LEDs and

90
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:26,840
really helping address yeah different

91
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:29,150
stages of growth yeah I mean there's a

92
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,670
tons more research to be done on the

93
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,590
specific spectral composition as it

94
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,589
relates to secondary metabolites in

95
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,900
cannabis you know I think that we have

96
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,909
indications now that blue blue light

97
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,459
during veg and red light towards the

98
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:44,780
flowering phase sort of you know being

99
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,819
back in California reminds me of the

100
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,000
sunset over the California coast and the

101
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:52,549
fall where it gets your very deep red

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,199
but there really just isn't empirical

103
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,719
research and the cannabis space that I'm

104
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,699
aware of at this point that is truly

105
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,370
looking at how do the different light

106
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:03,709
spectral compositions affect those

107
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,810
metabolites yeah well and to that end

108
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:07,519
that's actually something that my

109
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,129
research program at fluence is pretty

110
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,870
focused on mm-hmm and you're absolutely

111
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:13,549
right I mean there isn't a lot of

112
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,379
research out there right now and what's

113
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:17,239
more is that on both the recreational

114
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:20,139
side and on the medicinal side there

115
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:22,909
isn't a clear desire metabolic profile

116
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,649
right people know a lot about THC right

117
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,280
and a little bit less know about CBD but

118
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:28,310
they know it's there

119
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,779
right and then further still they know

120
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,970
that there's this class of compounds

121
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:33,589
called cannabinoids right and this class

122
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,060
of compounds called terpenes and we know

123
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:36,919
that we like some kind of cocktail of

124
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,170
these things yeah why does cbn matter

125
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,240
you know we don't know exactly yeah and

126
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,520
you can you can look to a few different

127
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,139
parts of the world that are kind of

128
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,689
driving that more clinical research and

129
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,219
trying to understand how these different

130
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:52,790
cocktails of chemicals affect the human

131
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,680
body well mister otherwise right israel

132
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,200
is kind of the world leader in this for

133
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,519
what it's worth but yeah like we are

134
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,589
explicitly trying to understand how

135
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,689
different light qualities and letting

136
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:04,789
intensities and even like scheduling how

137
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:07,219
these affect these profiles right it's

138
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,740
something that I have some published

139
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,630
work on for my PhD and it's also

140
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,040
something that we've one study that's

141
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:14,300
publicly available we talk about it a

142
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,610
lot we did with proof calls of our last

143
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:21,199
year there grow our up in Portland OR

144
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,400
Ligurian that one was Jeremy plum that's

145
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,310
right yeah

146
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,799
with that study they were looking at

147
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,110
well they fluence we were looking at the

148
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,939
red fire red ratio and we basically took

149
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,800
one of our standard products that has

150
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:35,478
you know a lot of white diodes with some

151
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,030
red diodes and we took it at the red

152
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,439
diodes and added four red diodes and we

153
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,478
were comparing these two things so one

154
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:45,139
of these things had a red far-red ratio

155
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:47,418
of about 17.5 so in other words a lot of

156
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,250
red very much far red and then they'll

157
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:52,039
when the red fluoride ratio was about

158
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,529
six point one so it's still high red but

159
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:58,010
a lot more far red and what we found

160
00:05:54,529 --> 00:06:00,228
there was that it did really interesting

161
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:01,939
things to the terpene profiles right so

162
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:04,129
what we found there was that it didn't

163
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:07,129
just in blanket terms it didn't just

164
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:09,199
boost monoterpenes or or you know

165
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:12,019
decrease Esper terpenes or anything like

166
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,418
that it selectively manipulated certain

167
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:15,769
terpenes interesting so what this says

168
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:17,120
to me and also kind of why i want to

169
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:19,430
explore this further is because what it

170
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,918
says is that with specific light

171
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,990
qualities you can manipulate and craft

172
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,000
really specific chemical cocktails right

173
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,470
and so as soon as the market knows what

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,319
it needs either recreationally or

175
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,750
medicinally will know how to provide

176
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,730
yeah and get them tuned the light recipe

177
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,209
essentially to the desired outcome of

178
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:39,550
the metabolism so what can we do to

179
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:42,099
support this process well I you know I

180
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,410
think that you know the the goal of the

181
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,150
IAE s conference is about sustainability

182
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,490
and I so in some ways we've sort of

183
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:51,129
jumped over sustainability but in my

184
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:54,009
mind reducing the costs of goods sold on

185
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:56,500
your cannabis flower is an absolute

186
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:59,349
necessity for long-term business

187
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,500
survivability so you know a good place

188
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,480
to start is with LEDs or a hybrid system

189
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,089
where we're looking at bringing in

190
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,700
sunlight with those LEDs just to simply

191
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:11,049
get your cost of goods down you know

192
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,029
soon enough we'll have interstate

193
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,069
commerce and I'm looking at the guys

194
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:17,979
that have built a 30 million dollar

195
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:20,290
facility in Columbus Ohio is there a

196
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,090
market which they can remain you know if

197
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,010
they're not focused on reducing those

198
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:25,689
costs and increasing their operational

199
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,129
efficiencies at this point I don't know

200
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:30,819
they're cool yeah they're gonna have to

201
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:33,129
moving forward right right yeah I mean I

202
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,569
think in terms of that particular

203
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:37,659
initiative to try and understand the

204
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:39,610
biochemistry a little bit better and the

205
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:44,350
mission to sort of drive certain

206
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:46,300
chemical profiles I think Solar tube is

207
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,180
a little bit removed from that story and

208
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,710
I don't mean we don't have that control

209
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,660
yeah so we don't we don't have the

210
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:56,399
control over the experiment that you

211
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,810
have but I could learn from you know

212
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,819
working on projects together and really

213
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,209
learning how we could use your tuned

214
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:06,189
ability to augment or work with daylight

215
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:07,419
and when is the right time to have

216
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:09,850
daylight because again the fun thing is

217
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,830
I mean ultimately with our product if we

218
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,040
need to turn it off at a certain phase

219
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:16,569
in the the developmental cycle right and

220
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,400
that's not an issue

221
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:20,199
I like to say that we in the research

222
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,750
that we heard up at Sonoma we fueled

223
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,120
with the solar tubes so we like fueled

224
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,339
photosynthesis with the Sun but then we

225
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,899
drove photosynthesis with the LEDs you

226
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,579
could sort of steer things in a way that

227
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,340
you'd like it to go and really just

228
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:34,840
pushing that further we were we were

229
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,090
just doing proof of concept you know the

230
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,710
first question was can plants grow under

231
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,019
these things you know that was that was

232
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,610
first then it was how how can we

233
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:45,549
increase our

234
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,350
efficient our productivity so exceeding

235
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:48,669
28 grams of square foot or 30 grams

236
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,009
square foot I think we peaked at around

237
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:52,929
33 grams per square foot and doing that

238
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:55,149
with the absolute minimal amount of

239
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:58,028
electric split experimenting with

240
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:59,769
different strains to see what strain or

241
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:04,689
maybe the bet was it

242
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:05,528
Sonoma Sonoma County Ohio okay alright

243
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:10,180
you're trying to throw me off because

244
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:12,189
I'm Canadian he won't know I think we

245
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:14,799
ended up hitting though in terms of

246
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,670
grams per watt was greater than two

247
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,229
grams per watch yeah I think so and I

248
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:21,338
haven't seen I haven't seen numbers

249
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,829
higher than that and you know

250
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:26,230
essentially we were looking at real-time

251
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:28,059
readouts of our electrical usage and

252
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,560
using it as like a speedometer and to

253
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,750
the point where we could just let's get

254
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,729
it down to 40 watts you know growing a

255
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,100
hundred square feet of cannabis on 40

256
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,720
watts that's you know a mainstream li

257
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,129
energy efficient yeah and then I think

258
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,990
the question the next question is what

259
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:42,970
do we do to work with the utilities to

260
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,259
get programs to support this process

261
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,329
because I think that's going to be key

262
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:51,159
moving forward is what can the utilities

263
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:55,899
do to incentivize you know really

264
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:58,600
functional well-designed hybrid system

265
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,309
yeah well and to that end I mean kind of

266
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,139
like I said in our panel over there I'm

267
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,549
not the best authority in the company on

268
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:06,189
this but we have a couple of people that

269
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:08,139
I focused very much on utility rebates a

270
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,510
lot of utility providers fluence has

271
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,309
been very successful probably one of the

272
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:14,198
most successful LED providers in the

273
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:16,119
cannabis space at getting those utility

274
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:18,549
rebates and so they essentially will

275
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,528
award you back the incremental cost so

276
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:22,719
how much more does it cost to do LEDs

277
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:24,789
versus the HBS they're gonna see an

278
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,379
energy savings we know that and then get

279
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:29,349
that incremental cost covered you know

280
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:31,659
really in terms of hybrid light systems

281
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,159
as well it's a matter of getting the

282
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:35,139
notion that there are other ways to

283
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:38,980
approach a hybrid light facility design

284
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:40,659
than just a standard greenhouse and when

285
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,399
we think about the the Sun grown indoor

286
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:44,559
the solar tubes with the fluence inside

287
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,269
of an insulated room really what you're

288
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,039
getting there is an environment that's

289
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:50,379
much more resilient to the outside

290
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,448
condition so if it's in Canada and it's

291
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:54,970
snowing in the winter you're able to

292
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:56,069
maintain your internal temperature with

293
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,710
a lot less in

294
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,000
energy input and so continuing to get

295
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,740
the word out there and demonstrating

296
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,549
that the technology works in multiple

297
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,139
areas and multiple climates and then you

298
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:09,899
know sharing that with with the industry

299
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:11,879
but also utility companies yeah so it

300
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:15,179
really becomes collecting more data than

301
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,639
in a lot of ways more data yeah you know

302
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:19,649
creating synergy between solo tube and

303
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,600
other other companies like fluence to be

304
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,929
able to put this data together to

305
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,759
demonstrate how it works

306
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:28,889
so you're accessible demonstrations are

307
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,990
gonna be keen absolutely and you were

308
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:32,789
mentioning you have like several like

309
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,100
over 20 just in North America right

310
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:36,509
studies cup lined up for 2020 yeah so

311
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,180
Wow that's impressive

312
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:42,240
yeah it's it's impressive and it's

313
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:45,449
terrifying and exciting and in a million

314
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,009
other things so I mean fluence has had a

315
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,350
tremendous amount of success in the

316
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:50,789
cannabis space in North America and

317
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,100
worldwide and that's great for us

318
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:56,759
because we can leverage that success to

319
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,769
really have a pretty aggressive research

320
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,929
program right and so a big part of the

321
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:03,029
strategy is how do we continue to

322
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,989
innovate in cannabis and how do we try

323
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,559
to address some of these bigger

324
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:10,350
questions our research of course is not

325
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,189
limited to just cannabis but since

326
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,629
that's what we're talking about right

327
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:18,570
now we have in North America probably

328
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:21,240
seven or eight really good studies

329
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,250
ongoing right now that will round out

330
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,580
within 2020 I'm pretty excited about

331
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,580
those

332
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,570
I can't be overly specific but I'll

333
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:33,979
share what I can yeah so I guess you

334
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,830
could say our research questions fall

335
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,810
into a few big bins right there's four

336
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,430
most there's just maximizing yield right

337
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:43,819
and people always want to know what is

338
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:46,338
the right spectrum for their top plate

339
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,720
and at that point usually when someone's

340
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:50,089
asking that we've already overcome the

341
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,399
debate of LED or HBS so are you also

342
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:55,310
studying temperature effects and ppfd

343
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,039
and what the optimal ratios are or

344
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:59,829
exactly the questions of the rest of the

345
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,939
environment parameters whether it's

346
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,860
temperature and day and night

347
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,420
temperature differentials and if it's

348
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,550
irrigation and nutrition and things like

349
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:11,179
that those are research questions that

350
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:13,250
we ask for my team they're sort of

351
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:16,309
second priority my team is focused

352
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,139
foremost on light light intensity like

353
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:20,449
quality light sort of scheduling things

354
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:22,100
like that but yeah so we're looking at

355
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,080
things like different top light spectra

356
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,200
and whenever we do a study we're looking

357
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,750
at things like yield not just total

358
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,028
shoot biomass but also harvest index so

359
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,370
how much of you yo this bud would you

360
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:35,929
actually care about how much is leaf how

361
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,240
much is stem so looking at these carbon

362
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:40,370
allocation ratios we're looking at

363
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,810
dynamic lighting so you know should you

364
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,759
be doing something different at the end

365
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:47,389
of your crop to drive secondary

366
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,429
metabolism a certain way just a 24-hour

367
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:51,409
cycles like sunrise sunset sure have you

368
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,958
done that yeah no we haven't done that

369
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:56,449
okay right so I think was really

370
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:59,869
interesting with your foundational

371
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:03,770
research was how you were able to show

372
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:06,049
that the plants do like to have a

373
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:09,500
dynamic source to a certain degree it

374
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:11,389
seems like as they how they woke up in

375
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,759
the morning change depending on the

376
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:16,189
light source yeah when it was exposed to

377
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,708
these subtly shifting patterns right

378
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,940
yeah watching them follow that you know

379
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,528
was interesting when we were when we

380
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,300
were looking at the time lapses back the

381
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,189
LEDs would come out let's say 7:00 a.m.

382
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:27,469
but the amount of sunlight that would

383
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,089
come into this space really wasn't you

384
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,579
know a peaceful look them yeah

385
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,260
significant until like say 9:30 10:00

386
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:34,459
but as soon as that Sun like did get in

387
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:37,100
the space the plants were just

388
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,800
you know they were essentially brushing

389
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,899
for that you know to happen so it's it's

390
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,579
interesting to think about that but at

391
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:45,500
that point you're still achieving you

392
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,320
were you know at the start of the day

393
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:51,019
you were achieving the the ppfd that was

394
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,510
desired right so it's truly the change

395
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:55,399
and special content yeah that all son

396
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:57,080
changed how the plants reacted which is

397
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,659
kind of interesting the special content

398
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,690
yeah okay would you attribute this do

399
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:04,730
you think too far red because that I

400
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,800
just think that so where we started

401
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,149
essentially was that okay they they come

402
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,679
up they wake up when they see the

403
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:11,329
sunlight and then there's this hot spot

404
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,799
that moves and they started following it

405
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,840
and it was just sort of an observation

406
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,240
right we didn't really empirically have

407
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,149
an a/b control but it seemed to me that

408
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,919
the plants were sort of appreciative of

409
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:24,169
the fact that they weren't just sort of

410
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,269
blasted with the maximum amount of light

411
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:28,039
for all 12 hours they were just sort of

412
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:31,100
this sort of you know dynamic see

413
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:33,019
something a little bit more natural you

414
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,879
know you could test it further you could

415
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:36,529
push it further but it just seemed to be

416
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,539
that there were some element where it's

417
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:40,879
more of a natural cycle for them and

418
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:42,919
that they seem to prefer the sunlight as

419
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,659
it moved through yeah you know I know

420
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:47,149
that you have some some education in

421
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:48,949
circadian rhythms specifically if we

422
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:51,470
were to try and pursue a study like this

423
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,970
we the sort of collective body of class

424
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,870
scientists not fluence and that solitude

425
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,879
in that you know

426
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,649
like whoever if we were to try and

427
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,439
explore this in the cannabis space how

428
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:02,419
would you recommend going about it well

429
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,860
I mean I think first of all I think we'd

430
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,870
have to figure out a way of being able

431
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,980
to sample well

432
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:13,850
studying the the various organic

433
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:18,050
compounds that you know change

434
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:20,060
throughout the change within the plant

435
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:22,149
over the course of the day and actually

436
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:25,429
do some controlled studies looking at

437
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:28,159
specific specific action spectra how

438
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:30,979
does it change the the organic compounds

439
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,419
present what's happening within the

440
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,879
plant I think it becomes a common I mean

441
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:36,740
it's an interesting question is probably

442
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,710
best answered with something that has a

443
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,930
very stable special content that we can

444
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:46,290
control but replicate the

445
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:48,328
the daylight process and then figure out

446
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:50,789
then how does daylight how we use that

447
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:53,278
dynamic nature of daylight and the

448
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:58,438
Chronos spectral dosage associated with

449
00:16:53,278 --> 00:17:02,730
daylight to now really drive the the

450
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:06,148
plant the plant over the course the time

451
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,890
exactly I mean I think what we you know

452
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:09,750
all of us are scientists we appreciate

453
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,480
data in like collecting data up until

454
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,699
this point cannabis cultivation and the

455
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,009
industry practices have been basically

456
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,019
community consensus that was developed

457
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:21,538
in the black market right it's a totally

458
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:23,189
different set of market pressures that

459
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:25,919
businesses are operating under and so

460
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,870
anything really that furthers you know I

461
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,059
used to joke two years ago when it was

462
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,949
you know i can grow three pounds a light

463
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:33,509
and i saw well do you have any data that

464
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,220
shows that no all right well then get in

465
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:37,890
line you know so my grandma can grow

466
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,390
three pounds of light but now we're

467
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,100
getting somewhere we're moving beyond

468
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,870
that community census and challenging

469
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:45,089
assumptions yeah and it's it's all

470
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:47,158
towards the drive of increasing plant

471
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:48,750
quality but also operational

472
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,830
efficiencies i mean really we are

473
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,159
getting the point where we have

474
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:55,798
evidence-based design right process

475
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:57,270
development i think that i think we're

476
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,119
right on the cusp of being able to

477
00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:02,490
really change kind of the old not

478
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,439
stigmas but the the way things have

479
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,750
always been done or how people have

480
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,419
certain preconceptions of how it should

481
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,980
be done and i think i'm really excited

482
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,080
with the the research that you're doing

483
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,028
and i think that that really drives the

484
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,798
industry and certainly jonathan

485
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:19,980
everything that you've done is it's it's

486
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:22,500
been fun to watch from a distance and

487
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,720
now it's it's interesting I've really

488
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,720
enjoyed being able to read your papers

489
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,899
and research over the last few weeks and

490
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,019
become more understanding of everything

491
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:35,639
that you've been giving all of our

492
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:37,019
respective backgrounds and I think we're

493
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,820
all it's mainly trying to contribute the

494
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:39,929
same same things for the world that

495
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,539
sounds like there's an awful lot of room

496
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:42,280
for

497
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,720
vibration may be fun love it yeah

498
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:53,349
excited about the opportunity

499
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:55,480
yeah me too definitely too great well I

500
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:57,399
guess I was kind of thinking about

501
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,720
moving forward and how this all really

502
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,780
comes together and I think it's

503
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,299
obviously more data more experimentation

504
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:07,089
collecting that data and going back to

505
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:09,129
yield above beyond biomass I think yeah

506
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:12,159
it's really about yield of the secondary

507
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,290
metabolites and terpene content and sort

508
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,050
of trying to determine how we are

509
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:20,319
activating these genetics on different

510
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:24,250
levels with this system and the synergy

511
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,809
of the system any thoughts on that maybe

512
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:29,829
I'll start yeah please

513
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:32,379
absolutely yeah so whether it's cannabis

514
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:35,829
or any other crop something that we look

515
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:37,990
at is really the interaction between the

516
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:39,490
genetics and the environment or if you

517
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:43,289
apply this to sort of human development

518
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:47,200
the sort of nature versus nurture and

519
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:48,299
yeah I would say that understanding the

520
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,890
environment is crucial because

521
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,690
inevitably for better or worse there are

522
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,520
going to be companies that are doing

523
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,380
things with breeding programs and maybe

524
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,670
you know genetic modification is going

525
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,200
to get involved and all of these

526
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:02,950
different things kind of on this sort of

527
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,960
more biological side more genetic side

528
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,299
if we start playing around with that

529
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,130
before we understand how the environment

530
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:10,629
impacts any of that it's just going to

531
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,960
become a very convoluted math changing

532
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:16,300
to many variables and exactly yeah yeah

533
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,970
so I think keeping control and testing

534
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:19,930
one thing at a time is going to be key

535
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,200
to success

536
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:26,620
data is no longer evidence collected

537
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,620
[Laughter]

538
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:32,739
just kind of like going down the line

539
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:36,579
what's each of your understanding of how

540
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:39,279
kind of plants what kind of light a

541
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:42,730
cannabis plant needs at different stages

542
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:45,369
of its life cycle well I'm certainly the

543
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,230
novice here so I actually look to these

544
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,329
two gentlemen because I just know they

545
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:52,630
like light and I've certainly learned I

546
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:54,399
mean the the the special content over

547
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,250
the life cycle is definitely new to me

548
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,350
that that's something I wasn't aware of

549
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:03,549
actually before this before today to be

550
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:05,259
honest so so I think Jonathan you and

551
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:06,940
David certainly are the two who has to

552
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:09,819
answer this question I think that the

553
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:12,190
best light for plants is the plant that

554
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:13,779
they evolved to utilize for

555
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,920
photosynthesis so that would be that of

556
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:21,220
the Sun but there are spectral banks

557
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,870
within par that we know drive certain

558
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,100
segments of growth based on the

559
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,389
absorption profiles and correct me if

560
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:31,449
I'm wrong of chlorophylls

561
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:34,720
and carotenoids yeah so I think it's

562
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:37,150
pretty clear that we can use blues and

563
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,808
Red's in early flowering or veg and then

564
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:43,059
late flowering one that often comes up

565
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:45,279
as well as is UV and the application use

566
00:21:43,058 --> 00:21:47,889
of UV and what that means for secondary

567
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:51,009
metabolites but I personally haven't

568
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,350
seen empirical research that shows one

569
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:55,359
way or the other exactly what the UV

570
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:56,980
does and I just think you know we're all

571
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,189
sort of looking out into the horizon

572
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,950
that there is more to untangle with the

573
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,230
spectral composition but what we truly

574
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,789
know has yet to be known which is as a

575
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,710
science is something you find exciting

576
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:11,049
you know we don't know so let's figure

577
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,200
it out what does the UV trigger that

578
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,839
plants protective mechanisms

579
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,330
and that's worth irrevelant man yeah

580
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,918
yeah I mean that's one theory I'll pass

581
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:22,859
the David to be a little bit more

582
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,000
specific I'm sure so maybe I'll start by

583
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:30,178
answering the UV question specifically

584
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,888
the short answer is yeah well actually

585
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:35,460
that's that is sort of a good way to

586
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:36,658
think of UV as a plant stress and to

587
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,298
some degree you can think of it as just

588
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:41,399
sort of a more extreme blue now just

589
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:43,950
like Jonathan said the empirical

590
00:22:41,398 --> 00:22:47,308
evidence in cannabis is definitely

591
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:51,899
lacking as a whole sort of the photo

592
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:55,138
biology of cannabis is a pretty sparsely

593
00:22:51,898 --> 00:22:57,869
populated world right now but UV in

594
00:22:55,138 --> 00:23:00,928
particular there's really only a handful

595
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:04,319
of papers that have directly explored UV

596
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:06,690
and cannabis chemical profile basically

597
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,609
the one that people tend to reference is

598
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:11,669
by a guy named John Lydon and his

599
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:13,829
research group from 1987 and they were

600
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:16,620
doing low doses of UVB I think that

601
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:19,349
Deepika mission of 310 nanometers a to

602
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:21,629
85% like that but basically what they

603
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:23,308
found was that with these low doses the

604
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,070
THC concentrations went up

605
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:28,408
proportionally and this was a long time

606
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:30,379
ago it was pretty well done study but

607
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:32,730
nobody has done anything on it since so

608
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,210
you know this is a question that that

609
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,370
worked

610
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,409
cautiously looking at it's tough to do

611
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:39,209
really good UVB research because it's

612
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:41,760
also a little bit dangerous

613
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,370
you know UVB for one you can't see it so

614
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,408
when it's went on you don't know and

615
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:48,959
secondly I mean it's the shorter the

616
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:50,700
wavelength that you have the less time

617
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,990
it takes for it to damage to you because

618
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,460
it's really just about the total match

619
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,740
of energy that's being applied to your

620
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,750
eyes and your skin and it's literally

621
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,690
just it has enough energy to break

622
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,909
molecular bonds including DNA bonds and

623
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,528
your DNA is always repairing itself but

624
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,610
sometimes it makes mistakes and if you

625
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,038
say you know what DNA I'm just gonna

626
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:09,359
keep hammering you with this UV

627
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,769
eventually your DNA's gonna go alright

628
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:17,729
well I've had enough kazar time so

629
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:19,710
anyway all that to say if we if we take

630
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,759
a less traumatic kind of explanation

631
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,009
about it and we just talked about kind

632
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:25,378
of mild doses of UV it's similar to like

633
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:26,509
when we go outside and we have exposure

634
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:28,279
to UV light we get a

635
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:30,740
and that's our skin protecting ourselves

636
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,629
from these UV light plants do the same

637
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,429
thing to some extent right and that's if

638
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,570
you look at grapes or if you look at red

639
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:38,120
leaf lettuce or if you look at

640
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:40,548
blueberries all of that pigmentation

641
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:43,279
that anthocyanin is protecting against

642
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:45,440
high-energy photons now with cannabis

643
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,660
the question that we're asking in one of

644
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,850
our studies right now is so you need to

645
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,769
do this with UVB or do you do it with

646
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:54,379
UVA or can you just do it with blue

647
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:56,660
which is a for us way cheaper to

648
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,760
manufacture the diodes have a way longer

649
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:03,019
lifespan and it's a way safer for

650
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:04,099
everybody so you know the jury's out the

651
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:08,269
photoreceptors are also a little bit

652
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:10,609
different between blue and UVB yeah just

653
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:12,319
cuz you read it on a we growers forum

654
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:14,569
doesn't necessarily mean that empirical

655
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,119
science was done to truly understand

656
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:19,039
that you know it's not a Thorat ativ

657
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:22,819
source well I think was what was pretty

658
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,980
interesting today which I never I'd

659
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:26,839
never drawn the correlation before but

660
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,690
was very interesting during our session

661
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,519
this morning was when we were talking

662
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,970
about the fact that obviously we have

663
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,829
photopic vision we have the photopic

664
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:40,490
special response curve for daytime

665
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:41,869
vision of the human eye but then what

666
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:45,230
was very interesting is that when I

667
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:49,519
realized that the circadian response

668
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:52,519
curve through the human eye PRG sees the

669
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:55,700
retinal ganglion cells actually directly

670
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:58,700
follows the same action spectra as the

671
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,319
blue end of required for photosynthesis

672
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,000
and the Cree curb it's like that was

673
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,470
pretty fascinating so I wonder if there

674
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,589
are any similarities who can start to

675
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:10,130
draw because my experience and expertise

676
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:12,109
is in vertebrate chrono biological and

677
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,190
photo biological response and what's

678
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:16,759
kind of interesting because we know that

679
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:20,798
the human eye and the the vertebrates

680
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:23,419
have obviously some danger zones and

681
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,849
once we get outside the visible spectrum

682
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:27,770
into the UV side of things it'd be

683
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:33,619
interesting to know whether maybe plants

684
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:36,990
have the same problematic yeah yeah yeah

685
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:38,729
sort of a danger wavelength

686
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,789
I mean isn't it just tough to supplement

687
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:44,610
UV back into an indoor space

688
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:45,329
predictively I wouldn't I would say

689
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:48,029
that's tough

690
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:49,649
I mean before LED there are a number of

691
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:51,420
other technologies like those

692
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,890
fluorescent tubes and there's there's a

693
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,960
few other things to start being a

694
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,500
tanning bed sure yeah that's a great

695
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,420
example um there are other sources of UV

696
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,369
as far as I know none of them none of

697
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,750
them have great lifespans and they're

698
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:07,319
not particularly bright not that you

699
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,700
want a hole so I don't think it's

700
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,069
particularly challenging and I've even

701
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,569
seen some really interesting deployments

702
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:17,339
of UV so the good side of cannabis right

703
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:19,829
UVB and UVC can actually be deployed to

704
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:21,359
deal with with superficial patch like

705
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:24,029
powdery mildew and botrytis and things

706
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,589
like that I've seen solutions where if

707
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:27,869
people have for instance a long kind of

708
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:29,490
four foot wide table and they have an

709
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:32,669
irrigation boom that moves the length of

710
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:35,370
it they've mounted a UV bar just to this

711
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:38,580
and it just kind of passes over and it's

712
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:41,099
sterilizer yeah yeah and I mean there

713
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:43,949
are other things too like certain sort

714
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:46,230
of strategic applications of UV B or C

715
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,120
you can induce systemic required

716
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:50,460
response in plants in other words boost

717
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,139
their immune system so you're doing more

718
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,670
than just that surface sterilization

719
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,850
you're also taking to the plant you know

720
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,720
be Hardy ER and defend yourself so it's

721
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,369
it's doable

722
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,190
that was my note from your presentation

723
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:03,689
yeah the photo reactivity and boosting

724
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,090
the immune system and perhaps pest

725
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:08,180
resistance with the UV yeah very

726
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:08,179
interesting

727
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:21,449
what so forget cannabis specifically

728
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:24,629
just like for each of you as people who

729
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:29,039
study plants and light what's kind of

730
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:31,290
like some seminal research that like if

731
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,559
you look at the body of light plant

732
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:37,200
science research kind of like what was

733
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:41,069
groundbreaking in each of your opinions

734
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:44,069
like and the understanding of how plants

735
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:49,889
react to light yeah that's a hard

736
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:51,269
question I mean yeah I - and I'm gonna

737
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,560
say this first one where I'm not at all

738
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:55,139
trying to just sort of toot my own horn

739
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,429
but a question that I've been kind of

740
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,590
asking for a little while is about plant

741
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,269
acclamation and just you know if you

742
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:02,369
grow plants in one light environment for

743
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:04,079
a little while what does that mean for

744
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:05,729
what we understand about light that you

745
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,169
use later on

746
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,049
there are a bunch of applications for

747
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,789
this I mean I know you said not specific

748
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:13,619
to cannabis but they're cannabis is a

749
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:16,170
good example you know if the light that

750
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,579
used during veg has any influence on how

751
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:20,100
the plants respond to the light used

752
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:21,779
during flower that's a pretty big

753
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:23,789
question that affects affects a lot of

754
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:26,009
people but on sort of mortar like

755
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:27,720
commercial agriculture side you can look

756
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:30,990
at it from the perspective of maybe

757
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,809
strawberries in strawberries excuse me

758
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,660
strawberries are propagated basically

759
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:38,759
clonally you can think of idiots it's on

760
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,160
like these runners kind of in a field

761
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:43,410
and they're in a certain light

762
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,850
environment usually it's sunlight but

763
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,009
maybe you've propagated them a different

764
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,299
way in a controlled environment you know

765
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:49,829
does that light environment where you

766
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:52,470
got all of your strawberry stock for

767
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:54,059
your production change how those plants

768
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,470
will respond to the light that you're

769
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,539
giving them when they're when they're

770
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,769
fruiting later on so I'm really

771
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:02,460
interested in that and then I guess the

772
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:04,799
other big thing to me is is this

773
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,720
question of far-red it's I have a

774
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,759
love-hate relationship with the sort of

775
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,370
far-red discussion just because it's

776
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:12,569
been going on for quite a while and it's

777
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:15,299
challenging because there's a lot of

778
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:17,519
really conflicting evidence about what

779
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,990
far-red does specifically for

780
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,779
photosynthesis and does it drive

781
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:23,640
photosynthesis and I'm not going to take

782
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,930
a stance here because again there's just

783
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,890
there's conflicting evidence that I'm

784
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,289
still weeding through trying to

785
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,550
understand it a little bit better so

786
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:31,170
when I think about far red and if

787
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:32,609
customer calls and they insist that they

788
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:35,340
want to speak to the research group of

789
00:30:32,609 --> 00:30:37,439
all red that comes to me any I usually

790
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:40,019
just say well look it it has pretty well

791
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,930
understood sort of morphological impacts

792
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:44,849
and you can count on its most the time

793
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:46,410
to kind of stretch out your plants so if

794
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:48,359
you have a really compelling reason to

795
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,740
do that and there are some but if you

796
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:51,000
have a compelling reason to do that then

797
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,519
yeah it's a good choice but if you're

798
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,559
just trying to add it to get more yields

799
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,150
there are probably better tools we can

800
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,470
recommend for it but again it's

801
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,090
something I want understand a little bit

802
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,890
better

803
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:04,409
something that both of you have said

804
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,570
that kind of has piqued my interest was

805
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:10,519
the fact that you know based on the

806
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:13,409
different types of plants that they're

807
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:15,269
where they come from the finds what it

808
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,759
is that they want or what they need so

809
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:19,980
I'm kind of curious as we start to look

810
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,009
at increasing the yield of certain

811
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:26,099
plants if studying kind of where they're

812
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:28,680
that what their home environment is how

813
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:29,299
you know if there's a specific growth

814
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,690
season

815
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:36,569
how does special content change say from

816
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:38,660
spring the summer to fall is that

817
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:42,599
something that needs to be replicated

818
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:45,810
that we can replicate then in the lab in

819
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:48,809
the the indoor environment to further

820
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:50,879
reinforce right kind of the biological

821
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:53,039
need or

822
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,390
yeah I wonder and what you were

823
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,190
mentioning to with like CRISPR and

824
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,320
bringing in DNA technology have you seen

825
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:01,080
any studies where people are trying to

826
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:04,230
add another chlorophyll or like you know

827
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:07,189
mutant chlorophyll that yeah yeah I have

828
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,420
heard of people talking about this

829
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,799
there's more conversation about this and

830
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,100
kind of like the microbial space and

831
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,500
laying around with algae I mean there's

832
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,459
there's there's a bunch of wild stuff

833
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,009
going on there's there's something

834
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,049
called chlorophyll F which I did a

835
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:23,369
YouTube video on a little while ago and

836
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,899
which is great because that'll be a

837
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:27,059
version of me explaining and remembering

838
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,620
how that works yeah this version of me

839
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:31,379
doesn't remember but it's supposed to

840
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:33,058
say chlorophyll F it is sensitive to

841
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,460
different peak wavelengths

842
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:38,339
then chlorophyll a and B that's typical

843
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,389
implants and you know in theory if you

844
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:40,798
were to take something like a core for

845
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:42,808
life that has a different absorption

846
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,089
spectra and a few other chlorophylls and

847
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:47,428
somehow mesh them all into one where you

848
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:49,199
just super effectively absorb all the

849
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:50,749
light right that'd be cool but they also

850
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,889
the reality of that it's just like

851
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:55,079
there's this whole light harvesting

852
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,609
complex for all of these pigments and

853
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:59,009
proteins interact in a pretty specific

854
00:32:56,609 --> 00:33:01,469
match yeah downstream signaling pathways

855
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:03,720
get chaotic a complex yeah I just add a

856
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,639
gene yeah yeah that protein nicely

857
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,720
integrate there's a lot more going on

858
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:11,699
but one day one day one day yeah I don't

859
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:17,038
I don't know very many centum seminal

860
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:20,100
papers and plant sciences you know I I I

861
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,808
think that the big realization for me

862
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:24,118
was once I understood what the Makri

863
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:26,548
curve was and then I saw what an HPS

864
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:28,168
light output I was like just how did

865
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:30,628
this even happen how did we even get

866
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:33,269
here you know it says if you were to

867
00:33:30,628 --> 00:33:34,918
make data-driven decisions this wouldn't

868
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:37,740
even have been an option that you would

869
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,230
pick and so that you know really it was

870
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,599
more about me wading into plan photo

871
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,999
biology from a neuroscience background

872
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,638
you know not from not from a plant

873
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:49,200
sciences background at all so I'm not

874
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:54,928
you know immensely familiar with those

875
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:58,259
things we had talked about the legendary

876
00:33:54,929 --> 00:34:03,119
Bruce Bugbee before again we had talked

877
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:05,368
about Bruce and his most recent research

878
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:08,789
can you just give the the since you only

879
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:11,250
read the synopsis can you give the very

880
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:12,929
poor synopsis it wouldn't be fair for me

881
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,889
to comment beyond that because I'm happy

882
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:15,599
everybody else's

883
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:17,338
yeah I know I mean I read the abstract

884
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,019
in the punchline as I understood it was

885
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:20,699
that he was saying that far red light

886
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:22,199
should be included in the definition of

887
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:25,828
part IRA for synthetic reactive

888
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,239
radiation because presumably in this

889
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:28,318
paper and it feels awful to be

890
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,959
commenting on this because again I

891
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:32,878
haven't read it yet but presumably in

892
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,710
there he has evidence that says or

893
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,139
clearly demonstrates that far-red drives

894
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:38,250
photosynthesis so I'm really looking

895
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,530
forward to reading it I just need to

896
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:43,219
find a time on a flight

897
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,220
we're yeah
