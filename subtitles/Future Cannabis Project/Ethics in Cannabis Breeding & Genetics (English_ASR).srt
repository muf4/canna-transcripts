1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,200
I'm gonna introduce Eleanor and let her

2
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:07,108
give her a little background she's going

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,599
to get into some ethics and genetics and

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:11,179
kind of take it from there but why don't

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,580
you say a few things

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:17,010
hi it's really awesome to be in such an

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,490
amazing group and get to talk about one

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,830
of my most passionate subjects which is

9
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,500
genetics so so just to give you a

10
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,839
background of Who I am I am a population

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,879
geneticist my specialty is in the

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,909
intersection between agriculture and

13
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:34,140
wild plants and how those groups talk to

14
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:36,328
each other so that's what I did in my

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,759
dissertation in I'm also a trained

16
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,969
herbalist and I went to herbalism school

17
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,829
not because I like sick people i I went

18
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,379
because I loved those plants and I

19
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,600
really wanted to understand how the

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,820
usage of those plants impacts the

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,489
populations from which we're drawing in

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,948
particular our wild crafted local native

23
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:59,159
endemic plants I'm from the south so

24
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:01,530
ginseng goldenseal cohosh a lot of

25
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:05,429
plants that we all love and use and how

26
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,859
do those plant populations react to our

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,750
usage of them so that's a little bit

28
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,299
about where I come from and so with that

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,700
background I've done a lot of work in

30
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,450
compliance and best agricultural

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,799
practices working for a lot of bigger

32
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,540
natural products companies to look at

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,670
how they grow their plants and how those

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,229
growing methodologies affect the quality

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,060
of those plants and so when I was in

36
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:30,209
that world it became very clear that the

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,469
largest issue in the botanical trade

38
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:38,069
globally is plant identity so fraud is

39
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,658
rampant everywhere and we see this

40
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:41,459
within our own community just with a

41
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,259
naming issue right so one of the reasons

42
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,750
we have a naming issue is because we

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,180
have in corporate structure whether we

44
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,170
want to see it as that or not that the

45
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:56,070
name of that plant drives value and so

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:59,129
there's incentive to rename plants to

47
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:01,199
gain value and this is deeply

48
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:04,530
problematic especially if you're dealing

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,689
with a community that is utilizing those

50
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,060
plants for medicine where you don't have

51
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:11,400
consistency so how do you know if

52
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,830
something works if we're not calling the

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,960
same thing the same thing

54
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,540
and then if you go and you expand out

55
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,460
into the agricultural setting how do you

56
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,739
know how your environment we're talking

57
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,090
about Appalachians and I'm so on board

58
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,909
I'm really involved in this conversation

59
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,129
but how do you move that direction if

60
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,329
you're not holding those plants constant

61
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,629
right

62
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,390
and so with all of this background I

63
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,939
started a company called leaf forks with

64
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,349
my co-founder Karen uh my affection I'd

65
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,469
call her my work wife which is how a

66
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:46,079
reference her my normally and our goal

67
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:49,680
was to develop genetic tools that can

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,050
identify plants ginkgo cohosh cannabis

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,180
varietals well that becomes deeply

70
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:58,340
problematic because the community itself

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,560
is the group that needs to do that work

72
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,490
right it's not my job to define those

73
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,199
plants right and so this you know comes

74
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,140
to the ethics of genetics and really

75
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,909
understanding what what are those plants

76
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,479
who are those plants what holds them

77
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:17,819
constant and so when doing any kind of

78
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:20,280
good science especially in the botanical

79
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,530
world one of the most critical resources

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,620
you have to do that good science is an

81
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,989
herbarium so an herbarium is a physical

82
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,789
repository where you take physical

83
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,640
plants you take cuttings of them you

84
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:34,259
press them and you define them so if you

85
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,229
go out and you find a new species this

86
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:38,459
is the first thing you do first and then

87
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:40,289
you write your description of what that

88
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,030
new species is if it's an insect it's an

89
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:43,650
Insectarium we've got all these fancy

90
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,219
words for basically the same thing which

91
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,840
is a physical encyclopedia and so

92
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,030
because this resource wasn't available

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,129
we didn't have the resources to do that

94
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,890
good work of ID in which plants were

95
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,530
which cultivars or varietals and so we

96
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:02,909
started an herbarium this is very much a

97
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,800
community run process you're defining

98
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,959
your material you know these plants I

99
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,670
know the few plants that I've grown but

100
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,530
that's you know it's small little drop

101
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,079
in the bucket compared to the diversity

102
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,689
that's out there and so it's really I

103
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,519
want to charge this group to to get

104
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:20,310
involved with that project because it's

105
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,750
it's important for this community to do

106
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,329
those definitions I can't say that

107
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,029
enough ik no outside group should come

108
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:29,490
in and tell you what you have that's

109
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:31,500
backwards it's not how it's ever worked

110
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,870
in cultivars it's not how it works in

111
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,490
domestication in general and so we need

112
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,918
to remember that like we have the power

113
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,370
and that also moves into this you know

114
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,979
when you're talking about

115
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,860
corporatization and what's happening

116
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:47,069
within the that world you know you can

117
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,800
see kind of this narrowing down of the

118
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,779
things that are available and talking

119
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,509
about ethics I mean my big stick is

120
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,759
diversity and if you're only growing

121
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,230
those things that are gonna get you the

122
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,659
most money which is completely

123
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,490
understandable what happens to all those

124
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,290
other plants that are so important to

125
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,939
the diversity in the fabric of not only

126
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,790
the cultural history that we have

127
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,680
together but also moving forward to have

128
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,710
those resources to be able to leverage

129
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,680
and grow with as we need I'm in

130
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:19,049
particular there's you know land races

131
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,150
and very unique medicinal plants that

132
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,220
have specific purposes that aren't gonna

133
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:24,810
drive a big dollar in a dispensary but

134
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,979
are really important to a group of

135
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,500
people for their health and well-being

136
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:30,180
and so that's another ethical thing I

137
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,149
think we all collectively have to

138
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,150
grapple with is how to maintain those

139
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,500
plants in community setting I mean I

140
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:40,259
don't have the answers it's like this

141
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,089
group together can figure a lot of this

142
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,430
stuff out but how do you keep those

143
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:47,310
plants going as well is it seed banks is

144
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,930
it everyone growing 2 or 3 things that

145
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,689
aren't commercially viable but are

146
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,340
important culturally I don't know

147
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:55,680
there's you know many ways to approach

148
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,839
this and so I know there's a lot of

149
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,209
questions people have about genetics and

150
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,689
genetics companies especially in the

151
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:05,759
light I rarely say this out loud and in

152
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:08,100
the wake of the Philo's ordeal and that

153
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,839
idea that you need to pay to play you

154
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,490
need to give me your samples I'm going

155
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,788
to sequence them and now you own them

156
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:19,189
it's like mm hmm that's wrong it's

157
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:21,899
completely wrong and it's inaccurate

158
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:23,879
it's completely inaccurate that's like

159
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,060
saying if I go to the grocery store and

160
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:30,360
buy a gala apple and sequence it I own

161
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,879
it I have no connection to that plan

162
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,439
right and so that's why the herbarium is

163
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,889
so important because it's a physical

164
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,499
tangible record that is free that you

165
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,478
can then link yourself to and ref

166
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:44,879
and then when we go to the PTO or we go

167
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,188
somewhere we have evidence that we can

168
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,649
all then collectively reference as the

169
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,088
community say no that patent doesn't

170
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:53,579
hold up because look at all these other

171
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:55,468
plants that fit that bill you know we

172
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,598
have arguments what is this plant you

173
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:59,968
know named X who cares what it is we

174
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:02,459
have a reference to go back to to have a

175
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:04,978
constructive argument because two people

176
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:07,168
yelling across the room is not gonna do

177
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:16,829
anything to move those conversations

178
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:20,579
forward so many co A's certificate of

179
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:23,069
analysis so many of so much of what I've

180
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,259
been working with like I know that's got

181
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:28,259
to be somewhat of a valuable thing in a

182
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,079
potential weird scenario future but how

183
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:36,749
much weight are these Co is carrying in

184
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:38,610
any kind of law form yeah I'm gonna

185
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:46,829
avoid the legal questions and punt them

186
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:48,990
to Dale but I know have to deal with

187
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:50,908
somebody saying anything to you

188
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:57,269
you could be like I've been growing this

189
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:59,248
for so long and keeping references of

190
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,528
batch samples because a piece of paper

191
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:04,259
without a reference to the batch is

192
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:05,668
meaningless right so every like so I do

193
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,769
a lot of work for traditional medicinals

194
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:10,438
and every time they make a batch of tea

195
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:12,300
they save a certain number of boxes of

196
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,009
that tea right so it's kind of the same

197
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,569
thing like it's just good manufacturing

198
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,699
practices that every time you make a

199
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,319
batch every time you have a particular

200
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,658
plant that you're growing in a season

201
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,199
save some of it that then links to your

202
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:24,868
coa

203
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,699
so then you have a chemistry aspect and

204
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:31,319
you can reference back to the material

205
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:35,250
that's powerful it just told me that all

206
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,440
my stuff is meaningless I mean we start

207
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,879
somewhere

208
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,600
what are you gonna get stapling it to

209
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:49,419
you saying yeah it really can be

210
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,909
anything again or is there in natural

211
00:08:49,419 --> 00:09:00,519
products the company itself does that

212
00:08:51,909 --> 00:09:04,059
work send you some weed yeah yeah so the

213
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:06,549
what oppressing is okay wait so the way

214
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:08,279
that we operate is very much in the same

215
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:10,089
light that you would for other

216
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,559
botanicals right so we're not

217
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,230
reinventing the wheel we're just

218
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:16,449
applying the wheel to this plant and so

219
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,879
you take generally speaking a vegetative

220
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,770
pressing to get the structure there and

221
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,600
you take an early flower I wish we could

222
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,939
take the glorious final Cola but no one

223
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,790
wants to give them up understandably and

224
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,010
they're really unwieldy to press in in a

225
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:32,500
press right so then you get those two

226
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,569
stages and then you fill out a form and

227
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,659
that form is evolving and we're really

228
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:41,580
open to any kind of additional

229
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:44,709
information we've taken the IUCN's hemp

230
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,410
form for their cultivar registration and

231
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:50,560
added things that apply to cannabis

232
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:52,539
which include chemistry flowering time

233
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,479
other aspects that aren't necessarily

234
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:57,279
included in that hemp form and to start

235
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,659
taking that data it's linked to you it

236
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,399
can be linked to a pseudonym if you

237
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:02,889
don't want it to be linked to you and

238
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,319
you can have that connection that you

239
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:08,080
can then reference in that physical

240
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,820
sample the herbarium keeps one and then

241
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:16,780
you keep one so you keep each other

242
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:18,670
accountable in that way yes so we are a

243
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,699
non-profit so it's been bootstrapping

244
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:23,620
bootstrap II as we all know and the more

245
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,450
we grow and the more momentum the easier

246
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,250
we'll get so we've been having press

247
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,020
parties this year has been a little bit

248
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,490
difficult to facilitate a lot of those

249
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:33,250
things since I'm running two

250
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,500
organizations but in different areas we

251
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,779
come together you bring those plants at

252
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,000
that time I have presses there it's free

253
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,769
you just have to show up we have

254
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,370
volunteers that mount things afterwards

255
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:47,799
at the end of season we give you your

256
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,129
pressed replicate back so that then we

257
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:53,979
each have one of those

258
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:55,389
pressings um it's really fun there's

259
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,920
herbarium everywhere so I have a really

260
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:59,549
large network in Vermont in New England

261
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:02,159
also in the South in North Carolina

262
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:05,349
South Carolina somewhere the more like

263
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:08,169
illegal all over California up into

264
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:11,230
Oregon so but in the the plants are held

265
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:13,629
locally right so the plants from Vermont

266
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,550
are held at a herbarium in Vermont and

267
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:17,500
so that's one thing we're also looking

268
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:21,370
for organizations that would be willing

269
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:25,208
to hold the material as public service

270
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,950
right so it is much like a library and

271
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,268
so the bigger the herbarium gets the

272
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,060
more locations there should be because

273
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:32,500
it you know Northern California okay now

274
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,328
we're going into County and then

275
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,100
hopefully we have more than one location

276
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:37,659
because we have so many people that are

277
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,659
involved it can become more of more of a

278
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:42,458
local resource and it really should grow

279
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:44,679
into a resource that everyone can

280
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,689
utilize and you know if the Appalachians

281
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,039
projects wants to reference it for

282
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,750
certain things then ulsan you have a

283
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,208
resource where you can reference those

284
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,899
to do other kinds of good projects or if

285
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:58,059
you have a project looking at PTSD or

286
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,100
sleep and you want to reference samples

287
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:02,139
and you could have a medical group

288
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,600
that's doing a research reference it so

289
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,159
that's you know it should be a resource

290
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,709
that's utilized for those different

291
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:11,740
projects and the way we utilize it for

292
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:14,500
full transparency is if you so whenever

293
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,870
we take in clients for leaf works and we

294
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,389
do genetic work for them we mandate that

295
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,610
they press plants and give it to or the

296
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:24,189
herbarium because it's what makes their

297
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:28,240
genetics worth something without a

298
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:30,130
physical sample it's just data I can go

299
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,409
and pull it from a joint I can go and

300
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:34,750
take us you know it's not reference to

301
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:36,219
anything tangible so our clients we

302
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,078
mandate that they do that good work

303
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,839
because it validates the work they're

304
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,069
doing with us and then other people give

305
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,500
to the herbarium and want to have

306
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:48,220
nothing to do with genetics that's fine

307
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,528
other individuals want to join we have a

308
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,528
cultivar identification program going on

309
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:57,100
right now and so if you donate and you

310
00:12:53,528 --> 00:13:00,068
opt in to that program we may or may not

311
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,870
utilize those to then make markers for

312
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:03,279
different cultivars which is important

313
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,590
just like we

314
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,929
for a ginkgo test or a black cohosh test

315
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,480
so that we're referencing material that

316
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:13,449
is correctly named and has history and

317
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:24,670
traceability attached to it and it adds

318
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:27,730
value to that farm so if I had seen you

319
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:30,879
have seeds of the same vino I grow them

320
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:34,259
here you grow them in southern LA the

321
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:37,600
genetics can be slightly different there

322
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:39,759
the value of that healing property will

323
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,800
be different depending on where it's

324
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:47,169
home so do we do you keep samples of

325
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,049
those and keep that listed you're like

326
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:52,269
cinnamon if we source cinnamon from

327
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:55,750
specific spots to get the strength and

328
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:58,149
potency of the medicinal strain is it is

329
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:01,090
this geared to that as well absolutely

330
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:04,899
so we don't make any requirements of

331
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:07,899
individuals this community doesn't like

332
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,879
to be told what to do right and we're

333
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,009
not here to mandate we're here to to

334
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:15,370
really serve as a container but if you

335
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:17,679
have COAS from labs if you've done

336
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:20,560
sequencing with another lab if you've

337
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:23,079
done chemical testing you can link all

338
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,479
of that stuff to your samples there's no

339
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,280
requirement but that is something that

340
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,500
you can absolutely do it an adds value

341
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,779
especially as a farmer I have a couple

342
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,190
farmers that have different locations

343
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,079
and they're growing like six things in

344
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,450
all of their locations and so they're

345
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,240
really seeing it as a you tool and a

346
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:41,530
utility to their own process to

347
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,589
understand how do those different

348
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,809
locations affect the quality of those

349
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:48,790
plants so you can start to get at that G

350
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:50,619
by E that genetics by environment which

351
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:53,049
is what we're all a product of right

352
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,690
genetics is just the backbone the

353
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:58,359
environment is you know the nurturing

354
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:01,210
that gets us to our true phenotype are

355
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,089
true outward expression regardless if

356
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:07,170
we're a plant or an animal and so we do

357
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:07,170
do that but it's not mandatory

358
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:13,620
and I I just wanna I guess also open it

359
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:16,139
up and say I know in these situations

360
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,610
when it comes to genetics and ethics and

361
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,509
like what are people doing with my data

362
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,789
and what kind of data do I not want to

363
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:25,710
share and what kind of data is really in

364
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,569
our best interest to share I think it's

365
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,790
a really good opportunity to have some

366
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,100
of those conversations and be really

367
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:33,899
open about it because there's a lot of

368
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,120
fear understandably there's a lot of

369
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:40,139
fear of thievery there's a lot of fear

370
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:44,340
of ownership and who owns what and I

371
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:46,049
don't know exactly where everyone sits

372
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,340
but that's a conversation I would love

373
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:52,169
to have with people this is something

374
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:54,030
that I'm very passionate about and you

375
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:56,309
know I'm here with the plants and so

376
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:57,959
it's really about stewarding them and

377
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:59,429
then taking care of those individuals

378
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:04,670
and humans that are taking care of those

379
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:08,129
plants yeah so right now we're

380
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:11,159
fundraising to digitize the samples that

381
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:13,259
we have and it wouldn't be public it

382
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:15,539
would be if you contribute to the

383
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:20,100
herbarium you have access to those

384
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:21,959
resources and that's the ways in and we

385
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,750
made wheat it may change and grow so you

386
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,950
but it's really to stop outside entities

387
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:30,029
that are really that just there to pull

388
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:32,759
data and not support the mission of the

389
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:34,019
organization so that's that's why we

390
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,029
made that decision and we're of course

391
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:40,679
open to discussion but that's why we

392
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:43,230
stand there at the moment and your data

393
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,519
is your data right so you pull that data

394
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,509
whenever like you're if you're

395
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,509
contributing plants

396
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,919
the pressings are really beautiful to

397
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:53,919
look at

398
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:58,789
and if you're going to the Emerald cup

399
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,379
both leaf works and candor will have

400
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:01,610
separate booths and you can see some of

401
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,350
these pressings and we've made some

402
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,939
posters of some of them wait one of

403
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:08,349
Wade's plants is one of those posters

404
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:08,350
you can check out

405
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:22,289
want to talk about like protecting data

406
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,109
and genetic material for ethical

407
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:28,289
business strategies that would help that

408
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:30,279
help us yeah

409
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:35,480
[Music]

410
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:38,329
so I I thought it was really graceful

411
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,819
how Eleanor kind of avoided talking

412
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:42,289
about Philo's and I want to make sure

413
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:45,500
that we're not gonna get stuck on

414
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:48,759
rehashing or complaining but it is it's

415
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:52,069
like the asteroid impact that changed

416
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:54,140
life after that it changed our industry

417
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:57,139
and it's important to take that into

418
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,509
account and some lessons and I some of

419
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,600
us got very burned by Philo's and others

420
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:05,629
just watched it but we're all here so

421
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:09,109
what matters is do we take any lessons

422
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:14,360
from that and I think a couple of things

423
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:16,729
that that we can take from it I wrote a

424
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:20,209
blog post called demand this and all

425
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:22,900
your business relationships transparency

426
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:26,450
accountability and trustworthiness and

427
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:28,130
if you think about the problems that we

428
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,910
learned from hopefully that we the

429
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:35,570
lessons we learned are was your

430
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:38,240
transparency was there accountability

431
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:39,649
and did that lead us to did it did it

432
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,690
create the appearance of trustworthiness

433
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:46,340
or actual trustworthiness and so much

434
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,798
more important is going forward do we do

435
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:51,439
that in our own in our own activities in

436
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:55,548
our own businesses and as we look at

437
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,490
groups that are offering to receive and

438
00:18:55,548 --> 00:19:00,230
store data or handle your data or we

439
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,599
look at groups that are offering to

440
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:08,200
receive and store genetic material like

441
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:10,730
seeds you you need to understand they're

442
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,279
trustworthy all their accountability and

443
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,769
their transparency and that means you

444
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,460
need to ask hard questions and I think

445
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:23,240
one of the fundamentals is that if you

446
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:26,919
put in data you still own the data right

447
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,919
that's that's really fundamental so

448
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:37,730
Eleanor Eleanor and I Eleanor Eleanor

449
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:41,269
and I are both involved in something

450
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,808
called the ethical data Alliance it's an

451
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,028
open group

452
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:46,519
we have calls every Wednesday morning at

453
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:50,919
8:00 except this week it's Thursday

454
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:53,419
morning it's essentially trying to

455
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,909
achieve something that the open cannabis

456
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:57,830
project was trying to do until we just

457
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:59,719
kind of closed the doors and walked away

458
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:07,368
because of the the situation with

459
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:14,469
Philo's it's that the goal is one of the

460
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:17,628
goals is to have a genuinely ethical

461
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:20,028
opportunity to receive and relay data to

462
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:21,519
other people this is an organization

463
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:23,659
that won't do any of its own breeding

464
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,079
there's one there's one an important

465
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:27,739
point

466
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:31,069
it's an also an organization that if you

467
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:32,629
submit data it's still your data this is

468
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:35,088
something right now we're just talking

469
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:37,218
about we're talking about forming the

470
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:38,479
right way of organizing it with the

471
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:41,119
right ground rules the right statement

472
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:43,278
of ethics the right operate operational

473
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:45,499
procedures and then once we get all that

474
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:48,229
in place and we think that people will

475
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:50,749
want to take advantage of it then we

476
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:52,759
will have to get to the infrastructure

477
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,618
the IT capabilities of handling those

478
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,929
data and everything but one of the I

479
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:59,918
think one of our key principles is you

480
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:04,759
put in your data on whatever terms you

481
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,049
you wish so it might be I don't want

482
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:08,838
this to be used for any commercial

483
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:10,729
purpose or I want it to only be used by

484
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:13,908
members in good standing of this

485
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:15,469
organization or I just want this out

486
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:17,450
there and this is a convenient way to

487
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:19,759
put it out and I put no restrictions on

488
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,649
it it might be you can use this for a

489
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,960
commercial purpose but then I want a

490
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:27,108
certain defined royalty from anything

491
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,879
you get and I think different people who

492
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:32,388
own data and have different reasons for

493
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:34,218
sharing it can have can be ethical and

494
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:36,798
still have any one of those approaches

495
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:38,210
to how their data are used in a similar

496
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,489
way for a while we were looking at doing

497
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,649
that having the same organization handle

498
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:44,629
seeds because a lot of people have have

499
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:47,028
come to me and told me look I've got

500
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:48,288
these legacy collections of seeds rare

501
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:50,388
seeds landraces

502
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:52,460
what is something somebody gave me

503
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:54,769
whatever and I want to make sure that

504
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,730
they are that they're going to

505
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:58,788
ultimately

506
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:01,460
to the genetic diversity as planned we

507
00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:03,798
all know that there's vast diversity in

508
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,710
cannabis genetics but most of what

509
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:07,490
people are working with right now

510
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,350
suffers from something called the

511
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,778
founder effect you've all heard of the

512
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:14,359
founder effect is basically if you have

513
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:16,690
okay let's say that people got stuck on

514
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:19,939
Gilligan's Island forever and they had

515
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:24,139
babies well everybody would either have

516
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:26,630
mr. Howells DNA or the professor's or

517
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:28,668
Gilligan's or the skipper's right no

518
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,760
Gilligan well he got around you know

519
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:33,380
Gilligan got around everybody got

520
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:37,099
Gilligan's DNA at one point or another

521
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:39,019
point is there would be a limited

522
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:40,908
diversity no matter how many people

523
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:42,349
ended up on that island and if let's say

524
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:43,940
the island was huge you could have a

525
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:45,019
billion people on that island but they

526
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,230
would have gone through a genetic

527
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:51,109
bottleneck where there were only a small

528
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,880
number of possible parents and all the

529
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:55,250
rest of the genetic diverted have been

530
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,230
white by the way there wouldn't there

531
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,490
wouldn't be there'd be vastly limited

532
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,960
diversity and that's what's happened

533
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,929
with cannabis the cannabis that has been

534
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,139
bred for the last couple of generations

535
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:09,080
to maximize THC and do this in that it

536
00:23:06,138 --> 00:23:12,288
has disproportionately been selected

537
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:14,658
from a certain collection of original

538
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:16,099
parents instead of sampling from the

539
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,899
whole wide diversity so I'm telling you

540
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:20,928
what you already know but our goal with

541
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:25,839
the with this group and this this

542
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:29,240
project is to have a way that people can

543
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,730
can trust putting their seeds in for

544
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,669
safekeeping or for whatever else what

545
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,160
other cheese I didn't even smoke very

546
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:39,820
much

547
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:42,610
I need to smoke more and more often the

548
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:44,500
the goal is that what

549
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:46,569
at first we were thinking of doing this

550
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,880
all in one organization and then we

551
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:51,220
realized okay genetic material that's

552
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,630
really important first of all you don't

553
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,160
want to have it all in one place you

554
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:59,080
don't want to have something bad happen

555
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:01,420
and everything die you also you can as

556
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:03,609
much as you can abuse data you can abuse

557
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:06,570
genetic information even more you can

558
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:09,039
you you you know it's it's got to be

559
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:10,599
really trustworthy you can't have one

560
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,799
let's say you have one aggregator let's

561
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:14,949
say I'm the aggregator and I tell you

562
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:15,819
trust me I just want all your seeds but

563
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,920
you can trust me

564
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:21,189
maybe you can but you don't know that

565
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:27,220
and so what we've decided to do instead

566
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:29,470
is a kind of a like a library system of

567
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,900
local seed banks that all agree to play

568
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,029
by certain principles it'll you know

569
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,180
it'll give people who put their seeds in

570
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:38,559
there some options about what they want

571
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,220
the use to be they want it just for

572
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,069
safekeeping

573
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,769
do they want it again same same list of

574
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:46,509
options share it non-commercially share

575
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:47,980
it commercially but with a royalty share

576
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:50,410
it commercially without a whatever and

577
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,870
so the person who puts the seeds in

578
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,970
should still own the seeds and they

579
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:57,429
should have be able to have their rules

580
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,950
for putting that in govern the rules for

581
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:02,560
taking it out and we're thinking that if

582
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,680
we can come up with a coherent set of

583
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,079
rules that aren't two rules easy they

584
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,350
don't do alienate everybody we can

585
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:13,990
actually have a bunch of independent

586
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:15,189
seed libraries sign onto this and then

587
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,920
it would almost it would really be like

588
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,450
a library system we if we can if we can

589
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,300
actually create corresponding

590
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:25,900
information then it could be ok I'm a

591
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:28,990
breeder I want to bring in some some

592
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,030
Southern African whatever and and what

593
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,670
are my choices and who's offering it for

594
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:36,190
for no royalty or for a modest royalty

595
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:39,850
and you can really start we will see a

596
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,440
huge increase in the diversity of the

597
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:43,899
genetics of commercial cannabis which

598
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,400
would be really cool so that we did

599
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,050
decide to do that differently from the

600
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,960
ethical data Alliance so we really are

601
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:51,548
creating two separate structures

602
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,169
right now it is we're just a lot of

603
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:55,750
people with good intentions talking

604
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:59,409
every Wednesday morning we do intend to

605
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:00,548
take it to actual fruition we've got

606
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:02,230
we've all got better things to do than

607
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:04,990
just talk on the phone once a week so we

608
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:07,630
are gonna make it happen we'd love the

609
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:10,450
support of this group or anybody else if

610
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:13,299
you're interested send me an email and

611
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:16,120
I'll get you on the on the call-in list

612
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:18,250
I mean I think it's just we'll send you

613
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:20,879
the dial and information there's no it's

614
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,880
an open group
