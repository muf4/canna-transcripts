2
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:20,278
in California we're about to launch upon

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,320
a very regulated market so we've had

4
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,868
medical cannabis for the last over 20

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,198
years and if you've been cultivating

6
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:29,490
cannabis in the state of California

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,309
hopefully you've been operating as a

8
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:34,199
non-profit collective and there is a

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,968
particular business corporate

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,550
organizational structure and kind of

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,820
financial model that one needs to follow

12
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:44,399
so the first thing that I always

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,549
recommend to folks who are growers

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,700
people are operating under this

15
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:54,299
nonprofit collective model why that

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,070
matters is because none of this is fully

17
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,140
regulated today none of this these

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,969
businesses are not fully legalized

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,259
commercial cannabis activity that

20
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:09,960
doesn't really launch until January 1st

21
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:12,000
2018 and even even on that date we're

22
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:16,259
still under a transitionary period so I

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,359
sort of think about it like businesses

24
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,879
are operating growers are operating in a

25
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:24,750
quasi legal environment where you're

26
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:27,179
legality is hinging upon are you this

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,409
not-for-profit collective cooperative

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,840
sort of business or entity structure

29
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:37,070
which creates a solid sort of step1

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,960
foundation so step one get compliant now

31
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:43,219
make sure that your operations are in

32
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,019
order now so that one can comfortably

33
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:48,959
interface with their local county and

34
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:51,629
various other agencies and departments

35
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,478
both on a local and state level to

36
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:57,269
pursue what is ultimately a state

37
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,849
license so visually it's sort of like

38
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,129
we're going on work you're going down a

39
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,828
road you're taking a path really you're

40
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:06,359
not on any sort of you know it's as if

41
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:08,128
you're out in the desert and you're just

42
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,530
we've been just sort of driving around

43
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,818
and once awhile you see like you see

44
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,180
dirt roads and

45
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:18,399
that's today where you want to be is if

46
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,819
you're a grower envisioning what type of

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,859
cultivation state license do I want and

48
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:57,789
so maybe going on the California

49
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:59,769
Department of Food and Agriculture of

50
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:01,810
astray lated market with that state

51
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,280
license and local permit and everything

52
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,039
that involves that you know will speak

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,739
about that's that's where I need to land

54
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:12,090
because a year after the state issues

55
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:14,709
notice of the first cannabis license

56
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,079
right the furthest state says yeah we've

57
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:20,560
issued our first official license so

58
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:22,959
maybe somewhere around 2019 2020 you can

59
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,000
no longer operate as just a non-profit

60
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,479
collective you need to have both the

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,180
local permit and a state license so for

62
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:34,599
anyone who is cultivating cannabis today

63
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,540
in California it really is about getting

64
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:41,138
very clear on what are the steps that

65
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:43,508
take takes you to that state license if

66
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:47,680
you want to operate in the regulated

67
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:51,128
legal market and so it really you know

68
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,799
while it's not always fun to sit down

69
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:56,438
and have very involved conversations

70
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,229
with lawyers and accountants and your

71
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:04,810
business partners or yourself about the

72
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:07,719
the this type of kind of strategic

73
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,870
thinking in a very challenging you know

74
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:13,030
still being firmed up set of rules and

75
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,269
regulations from different agencies type

76
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:19,379
of an environment but those sorts of

77
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:22,840
very intentional meet like meetings

78
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:24,939
amongst partners or as a grower oneself

79
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,579
making sure okay I know what I mean I I

80
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,978
haven't I

81
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:29,870
where I want to go and then taking the

82
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:33,128
steps to get you there is really

83
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:38,090
critical it's like you know when I see

84
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:41,090
people who are really kind of confused

85
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:43,758
about what those next steps are the you

86
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:45,318
know it's it's getting clear it's yeah I

87
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,509
guess it's trying to help get them

88
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,560
organized and getting clear on that you

89
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:51,348
know I just try to think about like

90
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,149
really practical advice because you've

91
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:55,098
got laws that are in place you have

92
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:58,459
shifting laws that are still kind of

93
00:04:55,098 --> 00:05:00,769
being figured out and so you know how

94
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:04,068
does one organize how does one plan in

95
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:06,918
in you know these really next six months

96
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:08,240
year and a half two years and the best

97
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:10,490
way of doing that is sitting down

98
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,889
figuring out what's knowable what's not

99
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,800
knowable and almost backtracking okay if

100
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:18,319
I want that state license then I know

101
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,689
that I'll need to have and that involves

102
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,960
something with the state waterboard and

103
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:25,668
with the Department of Fish and Wildlife

104
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,888
and these various agencies

105
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:31,008
oh geez here's here's what's required to

106
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:32,990
the CDFA that I prove in order to even

107
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,968
apply gosh it says I need to have this

108
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,519
particular type of corporate entity and

109
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:39,860
let me read these regulations that say

110
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,750
how I need to operate my facility what

111
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,939
this new track and trace system is what

112
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,550
the state taxes are you know what oh

113
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:49,218
gosh what what are all the taxes that

114
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,810
are involved because of a large majority

115
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:52,658
of people who are cultivating cannabis

116
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,978
in California and certainly people that

117
00:05:52,658 --> 00:06:00,829
you know we've worked with over the

118
00:05:54,978 --> 00:06:03,408
years are are not familiar with all of

119
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:05,448
those state regulatory agencies and are

120
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:07,370
not you know certainly not familiar

121
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,770
because we've not had such a thing with

122
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,069
you know what does track and trace mean

123
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:15,560
what will it mean to function in a very

124
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:18,289
regulated environment and instead of

125
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,759
turning your head away from I just don't

126
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:21,918
want to look at that because that's all

127
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,788
new and confusing and not what I'm used

128
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:27,348
to for the last 20 years or more

129
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:30,829
instead turning and looking at it and

130
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:33,319
honestly it takes a level of courage you

131
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:35,810
know to look at okay this is what I want

132
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,500
to do I have to take that leap and get

133
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,629
some good information and

134
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,990
take move and take those steps forward

135
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:44,430
so you know it really is kind of like

136
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,410
crystallizing those steps as much as

137
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,329
possible and so you know once you think

138
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,160
in the world of the state regulators

139
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:52,500
okay well you know you've got federal

140
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,840
law state law and then local right

141
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,819
cities counties so where's my physic

142
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,339
where's my facility located if it's an

143
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,409
indoor grow facility or an outdoor in

144
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,899
what city or county in California and

145
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:07,320
there are 540 total separate local

146
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:10,109
jurisdictions so what do I need in in my

147
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,699
area well there are 540 total

148
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,939
municipalities in the state of

149
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,819
California and you'll need to have a

150
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:19,800
permit from that city or county and so

151
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,740
in order to get that type of a permit

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,620
there are a number of items that will

153
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,079
almost surely be required so are you in

154
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,389
the right zone is it does the city or

155
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,209
county require that your outdoor

156
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:36,060
facility be in a particular type of Ag

157
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:39,000
land or if you're an indoor grow or is

158
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,220
it allowable in a certain manufacturing

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,740
area or not at all and that's a

160
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,380
challenge that many many operators are

161
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,689
facing and many interested operators or

162
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,129
entrepreneurs are facing which is still

163
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:52,319
a vast majority of these cities and

164
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,519
counties have no pathway to permitting

165
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,139
they don't have their zoning rules

166
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,149
figured out they don't have the business

167
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,978
permitting process figured out and

168
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:02,579
that's just the nature of being involved

169
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:05,759
in an emerging industry so on that front

170
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:08,759
what percentage of the cultivators that

171
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,779
you work with are doing everything right

172
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:14,759
right as it pertains to state

173
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:18,418
regulations but are kind of going to be

174
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,810
screwed by their local the vast majority

175
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:23,759
at the moment and the reason is most

176
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,759
cities and counties are still in their

177
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,219
local political process so one of you

178
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,250
know it just is honestly by virtue of

179
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,879
the nature of regulating a really Bo

180
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,668
Hemanth of an industry and having a very

181
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,219
thriving industry for the last twenty

182
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:43,019
plus years and most cities and counties

183
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:46,290
they're little political kingdoms

184
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,480
themselves each of those 540 cities and

185
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:50,789
counties has their own local politics

186
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,070
and their own issues and their own

187
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:56,309
looking at this industry and other other

188
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:59,580
things to factor in that make it more

189
00:08:56,309 --> 00:09:01,289
challenging or very easy like a desert

190
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,000
hot springs in some of these desert

191
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:05,429
cities that very much need the revenue

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,370
from this industry or established

193
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:10,469
counties like Mendocino or Humble County

194
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,870
who acknowledge that there is a thriving

195
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,149
cannabis industry or little one-offs

196
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,799
like West Hollywood that really believes

197
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:19,379
in this industry for the medical

198
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,969
benefits right so you have that extreme

199
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:22,769
and then you've got cities and counties

200
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,629
who are saying we've had a very

201
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,909
contentious relationship with this

202
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:29,070
industry or we don't know what any of

203
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:31,409
this means this is all scary and so then

204
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:35,640
you know you're seeing a lot of local

205
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:38,490
advocacy you know at City at City

206
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,199
Council meetings at County Supervisor

207
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,480
meetings and a lot of folks kind of

208
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,879
coming out of the green closet advocacy

209
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,590
organization saying look this is not

210
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,269
scary the status passed assets'

211
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,160
comprehensive set of laws with the

212
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,289
medical and adult use cannabis

213
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,449
regulation and Safety Act don't freak

214
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:56,250
out municipalities you know they're all

215
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,800
these state agencies that will deal with

216
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,899
the really meet of these issues and your

217
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,729
role which cities and counties this is

218
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,490
their role is really just to deal with

219
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,680
zoning so we're in the city or county do

220
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,419
you want what particular types of

221
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,849
categories of businesses and you know

222
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:13,740
that manufacturing cultivation

223
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,389
distribution in what areas and so it's

224
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,600
were really in a process of Education

225
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:21,600
and a lot of our clients don't have

226
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,580
local permits they are trying to figure

227
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,259
out or they're in the process of

228
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,580
applying for or through various

229
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,779
strategies depending on the

230
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:33,930
municipalities are are moving in that

231
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,730
direction or are in process but there's

232
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:38,609
it's a it's a problem it's one of the

233
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,550
challenges of what we are facing right

234
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:55,740
now

235
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:55,740
