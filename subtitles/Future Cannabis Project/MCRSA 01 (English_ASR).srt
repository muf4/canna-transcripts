38
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,438
left um about how we got here in the

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,199
first place as one of the key authors on

40
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,560
the bill a lot A lot happened over the

41
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,000
last year I mean the bill almost died a

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,479
few times it it was till two days before

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,840
the end of the legislative session

44
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,479
before we even knew if anything was

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,200
happening so why don't you kind of give

46
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:24,318
us an update of how how how he got here

47
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,719
hi um I'm Reggie Jones Sawyer and I

48
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,639
represent the 59th Assembly District

49
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,239
with the South Los Angeles and uh you

50
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,598
know

51
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,159
now I when I was in college I may have

52
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,039
seen some people do marijuana but

53
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,079
marijuana was not my thing when I first

54
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,400
started in the assembly and what I what

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,800
bothered me more than anything else as

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,560
someone who worked for the city of Los

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,040
Angeles for 25 years and like I like to

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,360
tell people I am a recovering bureaucrat

59
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,079
it always bothered me that it took us

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,120
all this time for us to come up with

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,840
rules and regulations and one of the

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,560
first things that we realized there were

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,280
many attempts by individuals

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,598
individuals who had the best at heart to

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,039
create regulation however they just

66
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:11,839
couldn't get it across the finish line

67
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,199
and so with the other five members um of

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,759
what I call the team uh assembly member

69
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:21,518
Rob B assembly member Ken culie assembly

70
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:25,679
member um Ken uh Lackey assembly member

71
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:29,239
Uh Wood and Senator McGuire and myself

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,040
we said this is a big big big big lift

73
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,840
and if you know anything about

74
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,318
legislation and I'm sure the congressman

75
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,319
can tell you how difficult it is to get

76
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:41,079
legislation through

77
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:44,199
uh it required every last one of us with

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,439
different skill sets and different um

79
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:49,079
parts of California represented um as I

80
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:51,680
said I'm from South Los Angeles but we

81
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,400
also had Dr Wood who's a dentist but

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
also was from Northern California knew a

83
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,319
lot about the Growers along with uh

84
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:02,158
Senator Maguire uh Mr bonter was from

85
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:05,798
Oakland area Mr kolie was from

86
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:09,039
Sacramento and is an ordained minister

87
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,438
um and Mr Lackey is a former Marine um

88
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:14,158
ex- highway patrolman and a republican

89
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:17,199
so we had a a large constituency that

90
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,560
represented I think most of California

91
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,478
if not all of California and that was

92
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,639
important for us to move this along um

93
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:29,079
we nickn named ourselves to sexy6 and we

94
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,319
we went at it as hard as you you could

95
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:35,918
possibly go um when we first came up

96
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:39,599
with the original um recommendations for

97
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:42,639
how to regulate U medical marijuana um

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,879
everyone had their own ideas of what it

99
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:50,680
could be we learned early that it wasn't

100
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:53,079
about we it was about I I want this in

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,759
in medical marijuana and I want that

102
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,719
which kind of

103
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,038
alienated a lot of our constituencies

104
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,440
and we couldn't get to a a number where

105
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:05,399
we could ultimately get it P and so we

106
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:08,240
made a concerted effort to put in the

107
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:11,839
bill as much as we could believe would

108
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,519
get past so where where for example I

109
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,599
use Mr Lackey who's a highway patrolman

110
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,758
for him it was very very important for

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,840
us to have regulation on when people are

112
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,479
driving while under the influence of

113
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:28,399
marijuana as all of you know in this

114
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:31,478
room um proper testing had not been done

115
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,599
yet and we don't know what kind of

116
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:35,240
regulations we need to do to to make

117
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,759
sure that if someone's Under the

118
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,240
Influence we can we can capture where

119
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,479
they are whether or not they are they

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,160
can drive or not and ultimately what

121
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:50,399
their impairment level is we put in the

122
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,360
bill um research so that the University

123
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,839
of California will go out and research

124
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
um different Industries and

125
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,038
methodologies for how you determine

126
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
whether or not a person is under the

127
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,399
influence that satisfied him and

128
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,800
ultimately I think it satisfied a lot of

129
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:08,279
Public Safety individuals who are

130
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,720
definitely against um any type of

131
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,799
marijuana leg legislation and we were

132
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,199
able to to get them on board along with

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,840
um several other groups because we went

134
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,120
out and actually talked directly to each

135
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:25,399
individual ultimately um we were able to

136
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,720
get the legislation passed through

137
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,879
overwhelmingly um in the assembly and

138
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,759
the Senate which the the government

139
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:36,199
ultimately signed um but what you need

140
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,160
to understand every aspect of this that

141
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,598
we could possibly put in with the

142
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,880
understanding that we would have to come

143
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:43,879
back with cleanup language was done

144
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,399
because at the end of the day it was

145
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,598
about all of us we make it a

146
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,318
conservative effort to finally have

147
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:55,120
regulations um on medical marijuana

148
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,960
cannabis so that if in the future if in

149
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,399
the future like November we have uh

150
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,680
adult youth marijuana hopefully that is

151
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,439
the Baseline that we use to ultimately

152
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,879
regulate that now that we know kind of

153
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:11,519
how how how how we got there um I'd like

154
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,360
to actually hear from the congressman

155
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,519
for a moment sort of on what he thinks

156
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,479
of because we've got it at done we've

157
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,719
have regulations here at the state level

158
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,519
obviously the big question is DC um

159
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,199
we'll talk about Banking and finances in

160
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,519
a little bit but from your point of view

161
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,120
you've been sort of a CH one of the

162
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,240
champions in in DC the last few for for

163
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,959
years on this what change have you seen

164
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,840
and do you think there's hope in the in

165
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:39,359
the future to get more legislation

166
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:43,239
passed look we are winning this war it

167
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,680
is a war for people to live their own

168
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,598
lives and for our country to reaffirm

169
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,439
that freedom is the fundamental value

170
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:56,839
that which our country was founded upon

171
00:07:52,439 --> 00:08:01,279
we are winning that battle when

172
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:04,959
uh it took a but it took more than just

173
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,079
being righteous or right it took the

174
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,758
right

175
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:12,918
approach for this issue to get us over

176
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,520
the hump and I've spent what 15 years

177
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,758
voting the right way but for the last

178
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,079
three or four years now we've been

179
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:27,000
winning those votes and it came down to

180
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:29,959
this you uh we actually challenge the

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,479
Republicans who claim to believe as I

182
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,478
believe in individual Freedom who claim

183
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,719
to believe in the doctor especially

184
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:42,479
since Obama came in the doctor patient

185
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,720
relationship the same people who claim

186
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,519
that they believe in states rights and

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,480
limited government all of those things

188
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,839
are are principles that would lead you

189
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,720
to the belief that mer that the idea

190
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,000
that the federal government should get

191
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:05,040
between a person and a plant like this

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,078
is absolutely absurd and a violation of

193
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,719
everything that we supposedly believed

194
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:12,559
in Principle as Republicans so how do we

195
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,720
get the Republicans to actually wake up

196
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,439
and acknowledge that because I had all

197
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,839
the votes from the Democrats all along I

198
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,200
mean they by the way that was an easy

199
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,040
vote for them because they were simply

200
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,240
doing what they thought was politically

201
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:29,879
right for themselves because their

202
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,600
constituency believed that it should

203
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,519
there was no price for them to pay to do

204
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,959
what we consider the right stand on this

205
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,679
issue so the Republicans had to

206
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:46,000
supposedly buck that and what uh what

207
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:49,319
happened is we changed the debate over

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
what the issue was the issue was should

209
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:56,120
medical marijuana be legal no it became

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,679
should the states and the people therein

211
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,000
decide whether or not medical marijuana

212
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:04,319
will be legal in their state and once we

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,720
did that I'm have brag I did come up

214
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,160
with that strategy once we actually did

215
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,360
that we won we won the first time and

216
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,679
every time since we've been gaining

217
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,759
strength and what's been making the

218
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,679
difference a lot of you have made the

219
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,919
difference but let me tell you the

220
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,559
specific people who made who's made that

221
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:28,319
momentum that Dynamic and it still is

222
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:31,119
growing on our side first of all the

223
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,839
veterans veterans going into seeing

224
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,720
their Congress person and saying why are

225
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:40,279
you keeping us from something that will

226
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,519
help us why you know so God bless your

227
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:47,200
that and

228
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,440
uh you know how stupid was it anyway to

229
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,839
say oh we can't let you use medical

230
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,279
marijuana because it might lead to Opium

231
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:59,399
here have an opiate you know I mean give

232
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:01,360
me a break so uh anyway the veteran

233
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:05,480
groups were important and here's another

234
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:09,200
group by the way just so older

235
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,759
Americans you know we uh what is wrong

236
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,839
with having an O and this isn't just for

237
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:18,159
medical purposes what is wrong with

238
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:21,320
having some 80-year-old person you know

239
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:25,439
enjoying themselves uh with smoking a

240
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,440
joint big deal

241
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:33,039
and so you've got you know so we're

242
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,680
going to spend billions of dollars

243
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,519
billions and by the way we'll borrow

244
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,838
them from China which makes it even

245
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,159
worse okay we're about billions of

246
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:44,560
dollars on something that is so stupid

247
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,838
as that and uh so I mean there's a lot

248
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,958
of things they do stupid in Washington

249
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,240
but this has got to be one of the worst

250
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:55,599
and you are helping bring rational

251
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,919
thought back to this issue and between

252
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,000
the seniors and and you folks and the uh

253
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:06,240
I I will have to tell you that I believe

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,559
I've talked to Don Trump uh he is uh uh

255
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,159
he will not at least from what he's told

256
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,759
me and others is that if the states

257
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:16,759
legalize marijuana he is not going to

258
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,958
interfere with the states and uh so I've

259
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:20,600
heard him say that a couple times but of

260
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,198
course with Don you never know what the

261
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,278
hell he means

262
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:28,198
so all of that but look we're in this

263
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,919
together we have made a lot of progress

264
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:34,958
again I think that uh uh this whole

265
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:37,360
issue over the years has has downgraded

266
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,000
the value of freedom in our country you

267
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,800
know when you have uh law enforcement

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,600
agencies who think they can just come in

269
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,879
and take money and property away from

270
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,920
people not even having to have search

271
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:54,320
warrants or or justification or having a

272
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:56,278
conviction before they steal property

273
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,480
this is outrageous it's never would have

274
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:00,480
been accepted by the people who founded

275
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,680
this country and wrote into our

276
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,959
Constitution and wrote Into the

277
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:07,359
Declaration of Independence about how

278
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:11,559
they were opposed to confiscation of

279
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,800
property so this is a uh we are we are

280
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,799
the

281
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:23,360
Patriots there you go we make oh I like

282
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,078
this look at this here he goes make

283
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,039
cannbis great

284
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:31,000
again I'll try to get this I'll try to

285
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:34,399
get this to Don right on but anyway it's

286
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,720
up to but as the way democracy works and

287
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,240
democratic government works be very

288
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,120
clear that it doesn't work simply

289
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,360
because the principle is right it means

290
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,839
people have to go out and get that job

291
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,079
done with the hard work of making sure

292
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,839
you're getting the attention of the

293
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,758
members who the people who were elected

294
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,880
to make decisions and then the people of

295
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,278
the United States all I can say right

296
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,559
now and all but the bottom line is the

297
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,320
momentum is on our side

298
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:04,799
the momentum is on our side and we will

299
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,240
win this but it will won't be one on its

300
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,799
own it be because the effort and time

301
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,639
and energy and commitment that we all

302
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,439
put into this and uh I'm with you thank

303
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:19,799
you very much God bless you thank you so

304
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,199
much wait one last thing one last thing

305
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:26,278
okay this is I really have to say this

306
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,719
uh look I was the reason I'm here is I

307
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:31,679

308
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,160

326
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,078
seniors who are not Surfers get the same

327
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,560
sort of arthritis pain that I've gotten

328
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,599
whatever it is they've been maybe

329
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:38,799
they've been working rather than surfing

330
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,399
okay but so here I put it on and it's in

331
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,919
about 15 minutes pain goes away but then

332
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,639
it comes back in an

333
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:49,759
hour now here's what I want to tell you

334
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,839
I know how these things work had

335
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,079
marijuana or say cannabis been legal by

336
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,360
the way not only would our Farmers be

337
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:00,638
making billions of dollars growing hemp

338
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,639
for rope and Metal medical marijuana and

339
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:07,360
you know using for fun marijuana as well

340
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:10,720
but the the bottom line is I only get an

341
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,600
hour's worth of comfort from my pain

342
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,480
right now had it not been illegal by now

343
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,159
there would have been genetic cross

344
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,519
breeding and you would have had a

345
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,318
marijuana plant that would give people

346
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,560
suffering pain an alleviation of their

347
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:28,679
pain for maybe 10 hours what a wonderful

348
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,599
thing to do for someone who's suffering

349
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:33,278
in dramatic pain but to increase their

350
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,440
level where they don't suffer that pain

351
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:39,838
for hours our bureaucrats have stolen

352
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,880
that from all of these people suffering

353
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,639
from these type of diseases and uh we

354
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,480
it's not too late we'll recapture the

355
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,919
ground and we will crossbreed cannabis

356
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,839
and that cannabis will go to help

357
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:56,039
alleviate the pain for hours and hours

358
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,319
for senior citizens to come so I just

359
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,318
thought I'd share that thank you for

360
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:00,318
that

361
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,480
so the next two questions uh first will

362
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:12,240
be at Fiona and then we'll we'll we'll

363
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,880
bounce over to uh uh Michael in 2018 you

364
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,759
know a lot of these businesses are going

365
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,160
to be coming forward for the very first

366
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:21,199
time if they're coming to you with with

367
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,679
with tax paperwork with things like that

368
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,279
what kind of things should they have

369
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,439
ready ready to go and what should they

370
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,639
know and be prepared to do when they

371
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,400
come to file their taxes for the very

372
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,400
first time yeah so um

373
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:41,960
hello hello yeah um so uh my name is

374
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,240
Fiona Ma and I uh started my political

375
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,919
career on the San Francisco Board of

376
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,519
Supervisors uh so like the congressman

377
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,280
said in San Francisco it's all about

378
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,839
relieving pain and making sure uh

379
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:57,079
patients have access uh to cannabis

380
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,558
that's affordable when they need it and

381
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:02,798
when we got to the legislature I serveed

382
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:05,319
from 2006 to 2012 we never talked about

383
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,000
cannabis um I don't know I didn't really

384
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:09,240
think it was an issue until I got on the

385
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,839
State Board of

386
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,558
Equalization where all of a sudden the

387
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,279
Board of Equalization is supposed to be

388
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:19,079
collecting sales taxes on dispensaries

389
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,399
and one of my first questions when I got

390
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,399
on the board January

391
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,798
2015 was how much are we

392
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,640
collecting and everybody at the agency

393
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,679
looked at us and said we don't know

394
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,440
and I said well how can a tax collection

395
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,519
agency not know how much we're

396
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,880
collecting from an industry well it kind

397
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:40,480
of makes sense now right we are not

398
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,120
keeping lists at the Board of

399
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,880
Equalization because we don't want the

400
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,678
federal government to come and say who

401
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,280
is in the Cannabis business how much are

402
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:52,679
they paying where are they who are they

403
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:55,359
so we don't keep those lists but we are

404
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:57,919
also saying you need to be compliant

405
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,199
with your taxes right that is so

406
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,919
important under prop 215 one of the

407
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,519
requirements is if you are a dispensary

408
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:10,799
you're supposed to get a seller's permit

409
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:13,960
and collect and remit sales taxes now

410
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:17,558
some of the more sophisticated larger

411
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,759
older dispensaries have been complying

412
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:22,038
um so they have been doing you know the

413
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,400
right thing uh some of the newer players

414
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:26,480
in the industry have not necessarily

415
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,080
been doing that and so that's one of the

416
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,279
reasons we are here is to say you need

417
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:34,038
to get your seller's permit if you are

418
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,359
selling to the public you need to

419
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:39,240
collect the proper amount of tax based

420
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:41,119
on where you are located and then you're

421
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,919
supposed to remit it to the Board of

422
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,279
Equalization um and I think that's

423
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,720
important in

424
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,440
2018 that many of the local

425
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,759
jurisdictions are going to be issuing

426
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,880
the licenses and one of the criteria we

427
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:58,798
believe is going to be compliance how

428
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,919
compliant have you been in obeying the

429
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:04,200
laws have you been paying your taxes

430
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,200
right and if you say no but you've been

431
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,360
in business for 15 years that could be a

432
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,919
problem right so I would say it's never

433
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:15,399
too late to start get your seller's

434
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,400
permit if you haven't gotten it um

435
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,960
definitely you know we have a lot of

436
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,280
information on our website we go out and

437
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,679
give seminars uh I have a lot of um

438
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,119
staff members here who can help you with

439
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,440
that but I think that is first and

440
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:31,199
foremost there were a couple bills in

441
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,360
the

442
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,400
legislature um this past season and

443
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:39,558
we're hoping they pass assembly member

444
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,519
Mike Gibson has uh AB

445
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:45,599
821 to remove the 10% fee on licensed

446
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,038
cannabis operators and as the

447
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:52,399
congressman knows uh banking is very

448
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:55,200
very difficult uh for this industry yet

449
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,080
all of the tax agencies assess a 10%

450
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,720
penalty if you pay in cash how is that

451
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,960
fair that you are penalizing an industry

452
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,679
and giving them no other option but

453
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,558
paying by cash so assembly member Gibson

454
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,080
has a bill on the governor's desk right

455
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:14,200
now if you want to weigh in it's AB 821

456
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:17,439
to remove the 10% penalty if you pay uh

457
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,919
your taxes in cash um the second one is

458
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,798
also by assembly member Gibson AB

459
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:27,320
567 which would create a tax amnesty for

460
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:32,000
any business that comes forward

461
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:33,839
voluntarily in a certain window in 2017

462
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,919
so if this bill passes there will be a

463
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:39,558
small window companies uh Canabis

464
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:42,840
dispensary operators should come forward

465
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:46,720
pay their taxes for this year and the

466
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:50,278
last three years to avoid any sort of

467
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,600
penalty now the Boe we can legally come

468
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:56,519
in and audit you and go back 3

469
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:59,158
years so if you don't have any tax

470
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,200
records it's going to be very hard hard

471
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:04,760
to defend uh what our Auditors are just

472
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,159
going to assume is your practice and

473
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:10,079
what we do is normally we will sit

474
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:13,640
outside your dispensary and count the

475
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,759
number of people that come in on a 3-day

476
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,759
period and we try to pick different days

477
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:21,759
like a weekday a weekend you know an

478
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:24,440
evening um and then they average out how

479
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,079
many people come in to your dispensary

480
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,080
they average about how much they think

481
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,278
they're spending and then then we

482
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:34,119
extrapolate back 3 years and if you

483
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:36,519
don't agree with that number but you

484
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,079
don't have any tax records you're

485
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,519
probably going to lose when you come

486
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,678
before us on the appeals board and we

487
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:47,359
are starting to hear cases now uh at the

488
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,798
um at at our Board of cannabis um

489
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,759
operators who you know disagree with our

490
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:54,798
Auditors but don't bring us anything um

491
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:56,679
and so that is just something I would

492
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,960

508
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,120
question and um just by way of

509
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:40,038
background I work in Private Industry we

510
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,918
work on uh regulation development and

511
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:45,119
environmental impact reports for state

512
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,679
agencies on regulatory programs and uh

513
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,119
maybe four years ago my business partner

514
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,798
said to me he said wouldn't it be neat

515
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:52,239
if we did the environmental impact

516
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:53,679
report for legalization of of marijuana

517
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,120
and California I said yeah that'd be

518
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,919
great we should how would we ever do

519
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,319
that and here we are four years later

520
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:02,320
doing it so this is a very exciting time

521
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,839
for for us um so we are helping uh we're

522
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,879
right at the outset right now with the

523
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,798
Department of food and Agriculture and

524
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,400
their medical cannabis cultivation

525
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,400
program and identifying all the

526
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,240
regulations that uh they're going to

527
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,600
need to establish and adopt and have

528
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:19,038
ready to go and Implement on January 1st

529
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,158
2018 um and what I can say is uh as as

530
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,038
was mentioned before with lawmaking uh

531
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,320
developing a regulatory program like

532
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,879
this and the associated software that

533
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,558
the state's going to have so people can

534
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,278
apply for their licenses online and

535
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:32,639
establishing a track and Trace system

536
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:33,960
that's going to trace the product

537
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,440
through the whole production cycle

538
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,159
that's that's a heavy lift and uh the

539
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,240
state has a lot on its plate right now

540
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,600
so I would say their primary focus is on

541
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,440
complying with what the statute says

542
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,158
there's a lot of additional

543
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,240
functionality and things they'd like to

544
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,720
be able to do uh that they're not going

545
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,278
to be able to do on day one and they're

546
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,519
going to face that in over time so uh

547
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:55,798
they're looking at just basically

548
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,398
meeting the requirement that they're

549
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,639
able to take applications and they're

550
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:03,359
able to issue those uh licenses so um

551
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,520
some of the things that Growers can be

552
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,918
looking for if you are intending to

553
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,960
apply for a license um is first of all

554
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,600
you're going to need to have your local

555
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,480
approval in hand uh if you're going to

556
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,480
be a medical Canabis grower now that

557
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,839
that will change under prop 64 for

558
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,960
recreational Cannabis cultivation does

559
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,158
not require local approval but as things

560
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,558
stand now for medical cultivation you're

561
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,640
going to need to have that approval in

562
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,240
place in fact before you go to the

563
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,399
Department of food in agriculture to get

564
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,558
your license you're going to need to

565
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:36,158
have every other state and local agency

566
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,759
approval in hand Dem demonstrated that

567
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,480
you've gotten that and that may be a

568
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,398
streamed alteration agreement from the

569
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,599
Department of Fish and Wildlife it may

570
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:46,000
be coverage under the general order for

571
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,119
the regional water quality control board

572
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,880
uh but basically cdfa is going to bat

573
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:54,199
last um the second thing I could say is

574
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,080
that um a lot of the requirements that

575
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:00,480
are going to be um uh placed upon

576
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:02,519
Growers now um are things that maybe a

577
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,319
lot of Growers have not had to handle in

578
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,398
the past and these are really things

579
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,839
that uh many other businesses are up to

580
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,959
speed on but because cannabis production

581
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,000
has not really been a regulated program

582
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,960
by the state in the past many business

583
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,159
people in this industry don't understand

584
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,319
these and this includes C oia

585
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,159
regulations and workplace safety

586
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:23,439
standards for Farm Workers people who

587
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,200
are working on the Cannabis sites uh

588
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,240
people who are part of the trimmer

589
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,720
community and are coming for short

590
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,519
periods of time to different cannabis

591
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,679
farms uh there's going to need to be

592
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:35,200
proper sanitation facilities offered for

593
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,278
them uh places where they can stay so

594
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,038
there's going to be uh in addition to

595
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,599
just complying with the state's

596
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,960
requirements uh for that the department

597
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,639
of food and agriculture is going to

598
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,840
place there's also a bunch of just basic

599
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,880
laws related to um running a business um

600
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:54,480
such as having your Board of

601
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,600
Equalization uh sellers permit so um so

602
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,038
that's really in brief some of the

603
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:02,240
requirements one of my favorite

604
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,960
stories when I was first starting ccia

605
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,839
was one of my founding board members is

606
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,720
a rice farmer took me up to his property

607
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,759
and just said you know and showed me his

608
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,679
his his one acre of land he had ready to

609
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,640
go for that one day and and he looked at

610
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,240
me and just said Nate I've been filling

611
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,000
out these Department of food and a for

612
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,319
since I was 15 years old I know what I'm

613
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,960
doing most of these guys don't and we

614
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,439
need to make sure that they know what

615
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,960
what they're doing that they know that

616
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,000
they're you know so they know how to be

617
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,798
in in in compliance with all of this so

618
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,079
that so that way they all don't get just

619
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:37,079
get mowed down so it's it's going to be

620
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,079
key
