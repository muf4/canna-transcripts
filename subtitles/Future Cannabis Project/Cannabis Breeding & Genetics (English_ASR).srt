1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,339
and the problem with them is that they

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:09,419
they do phenomenal selection based off

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,940
of vigour and resistance and quality

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:14,099
experience but if your numerix are under

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,890
17% that shit doesn't move at a store

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,528
and that's the problem so what I do is I

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,760
look for very disproportionate ratios so

8
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,179
I look for three hundred four hundred

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,699
and one THC the CBD ratios with five to

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:29,189
seven percent in early veg and then I

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,710
take those males and I find it in

12
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,929
clusters then I take that cluster then I

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,660
subsequently flour it to see floral

14
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:39,030
formation turn profile resin development

15
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,439
overall vigor and then I throw it into

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,590
situations where I can test the

17
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:46,199
resistance once I have that now I have a

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,820
breeder male that I can use and then I

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,039
throw it on anything I can get the

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,738
numbers to skyrocket and so then I

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,329
provide those males to other breeders in

22
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,399
other parts of the country in Europe and

23
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,009
so this way what it does that lets me do

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,660
this hunt I can send it to them they can

25
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,549
use their facilities which has much

26
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,738
larger potential for multi thousand

27
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:07,618
plants ifs and then I can then get the

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,570
cultivar back that's been sifted from

29
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:11,700
these massive operations so then I get

30
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,279
these outlier cultivars that were bred

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,780
using the outlier males I find and so

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,689
it's easier for me to chase it in

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,030
juvenile and then I use sex casting

34
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:22,349
signify loss to sex test because what it

35
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,180
does is it used to take me twice the

36
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:26,579
vegetative space to do all this shit and

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,829
now as soon as I have my first coil lead

38
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,900
and I get my first true leaf I can then

39
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:33,089
take a sample stick it in a tube

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,850
I do these there's little 88 tube sets

41
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,978
usually punch cards now it's an 88 tube

42
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,509
sets I send it to Philo's three days

43
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,429
later I get the results back and it's

44
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,409
accurate and so we've never had an issue

45
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,000
that's been probably 150 to 200 thousand

46
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,259
seeds done like that we've never had a

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,368
problem that doesn't indicate intersex

48
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,799
situation though intersex is still going

49
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,569
to be based off of how much of the

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,979
female chromosome remains versus the

51
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:57,989
male and as soon as we can get that

52
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:59,759
haploid soon as we can get into a double

53
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:02,669
haploid where we're going only into the

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:07,709
female we can then remove that intersex

55
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:10,170
capability so stressful in the shit out

56
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:11,818
of it's only a big girl and because you

57
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,619
because you have them though in your

58
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:15,958
life as a cultivator you have

59
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,090
plants that you consider bulletproof but

60
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,799
the problem is a lot of them aren't

61
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,360
these Polly hybrids you're playing with

62
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:23,099
right now where we're mixing we're

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,840
taking skittle and purple punch and

64
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:26,399
forbidden fruit the wedding cake and

65
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,250
with swirling that shit up and we pull

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,719
out some sexy cut and the problem is you

67
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,370
have so much Jam material moving that

68
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,689
you have no idea what's really inside it

69
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,009
you just know that the quality of the

70
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:40,229
end product is desirable but it also has

71
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:42,269
pathogenic prone tendencies and anything

72
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,098
to do with cookie lines is what we find

73
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:46,680
from breeding them cookie lines and

74
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:48,179
skittle lines has an incredible intersex

75
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,480
situation so I have two different

76
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:55,560
skittle hybrids that it costs 40 grands

77
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:58,289
in in work in two years in testing but

78
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,628
they both won the Oregon concentrate Cup

79
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:03,539
two years in a row with zero issues so

80
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:05,878
they're absolute winners in terms of

81
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:09,419
competition quality plants but with a

82
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:12,030
high degree of resistance Heidi it was

83
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:14,280
the Oscar shot of out of third gen and

84
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,509
so I had the skittle I know that I know

85
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,829
where the skittle came from so I didn't

86
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:18,239
get the skittle from third gen I got the

87
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:21,719
skittle from the guys that third gen got

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,430
it from out of Visalia it comes out of

89
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,560
Visalia originally if it was out of the

90
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,180
bay and then I got moved to Visalia if I

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,560
sell you as where the cut came from they

92
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,090
grabbed it from them we grabbed it from

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,969
them and then I held it then I released

94
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,069
it later and so I have a sherbet cut

95
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:37,769
from share bin ski that uses the skittle

96
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:39,810
as them as one of the parents and so my

97
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,900
my sherbet cut is like they called the

98
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,098
Green Hulk because it has that rich

99
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,539
skittle like flavor if you blow it into

100
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:49,018
a concentrate it's phenomenal but it's a

101
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:51,598
stunning flower too and so the odds cush

102
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,060
though because you you have an addictive

103
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,159
response to all basically limonene

104
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,628
terpenes and so tobacco companies did

105
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,909
research on what's the most addictive

106
00:03:57,628 --> 00:04:03,628
terpenes they find that it's lemon limes

107
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:05,340
oranges pink grapefruits that's the most

108
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:06,780
addictive response to determine that's

109
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,848
why you see people dab and heavy on the

110
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,530
fruits they come back they come back why

111
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:14,219
all of a sudden is there this incredible

112
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,319
resurgence in floral turps why because

113
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:18,509
the the OG chirps are popular cause

114
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,608
primarily it's a it's a mer seen as a

115
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,930
heavy and aesthetic so if you take near

116
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:23,848
scene and concentrated it's in an

117
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,740
aesthetic at a medical level and it

118
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:27,360
works as an opiate transferal so people

119
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,400
that use opiates can use

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,139
gee and get efficacy and treatment they

121
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,848
don't get from anything else because not

122
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,519
much else has enough near scene levels

123
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:38,069
in it but all of a sudden everybody gets

124
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,198
into fruits but why it's because

125
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:42,840
fundamentally that's your most addictive

126
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,478
response and so when you start to take

127
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,728
fuels which have the anesthetic and then

128
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:49,589
you mix them with florals and fruits to

129
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:51,568
get that that high monoterpenes

130
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:54,568
signature in Lyman Eames lemon Eames

131
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,189
mandarines and you put it on them they

132
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,860
come back so when you see what it was my

133
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:00,419
buddy call it tree basis that tree basis

134
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,430
because they can't stop based on that

135
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:05,639
shit it's just like it's for real tree

136
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,009
basin and but it drives a response and

137
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,778
so my partner nor I work with two other

138
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:11,759
guys that are friends of mine on a

139
00:05:09,778 --> 00:05:14,759
private level where they're both I

140
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,680
consider them fantastic sisters so one

141
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,509
of them lives up in Oregon the other one

142
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,879
lives over in Willets about you know 80

143
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:22,288
miles from me and so the guy from

144
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:27,778
Willits has been in cannabis probably

145
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:31,079
maybe 55 years and a brilliant legend in

146
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:33,778
cannabis where no no this guy's name's

147
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,189
Ben but Ben's at a level far different

148
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:38,098
than all these guys been we've been was

149
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:40,259
a monster legend balla from the day who

150
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:42,149
can't get out of cannabis because he's

151
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,278
addicted to it so much and so all then

152
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:46,588
does its hunt genetics and because he's

153
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:48,418
tied into the world so heavily it lets

154
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:50,870
him access everything and because he has

155
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:53,758
such a calibrated market potential

156
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,939
he's un-fuckin'-believable accurate with

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,658
quality of product so old ben me and

158
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:02,789
this cat out of auto oregon hunt and so

159
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:05,370
if i can hunt and i get one new thing a

160
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:07,468
year and then hunts one new thing a year

161
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,538
and my boy in oregon hunts one new thing

162
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:11,759
a year we have three new things in a

163
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:13,348
year because basically people like I got

164
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,509
something incredible but it's it's if

165
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:17,908
it's not better than the parental it's

166
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,560
not better and so the odds cush is a

167
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:22,680
good example of where we had to go all

168
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,168
the way into the f3 on it to find non

169
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,538
intersects capability under stress and

170
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:31,620
then what I'll do is I'll send those

171
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:33,269
cuttings in to check the level of female

172
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,250
chromosome present because we know that

173
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:37,258
under no no circumstances does it

174
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,778
trigger where we had to go through a

175
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,230
full you know almost 18 months of

176
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:43,870
working about 40 grand

177
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,470
and blast them through this to find

178
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:49,269
where do we find the outlier potential

179
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,610
and so with marker assisted it just

180
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:53,799
allows you to move a lot faster and the

181
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,020
bottom line is that it's gonna have to

182
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,470
be product differentiation and what I

183
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:00,669
see with cannabis right now is primarily

184
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,180
technology that's borrowed from other

185
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,470
industries that comes into our industry

186
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,290
so if someone said I'm state-of-the-art

187
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,370
that means you're using technology from

188
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,439
other industries and it's

189
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,189
state-of-the-art in cannabis but that

190
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,350
doesn't mean its state-of-the-art

191
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:16,540
because it's being used somewhere else

192
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,879
it's dirty and and it's an application

193
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,730
yeah you're a guinea pig but with

194
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,019
genomics genomics is where the state of

195
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,400
the art is going to be because you're

196
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:27,099
gonna be able to go into stuff that's

197
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,500
never been manipulated never been sifted

198
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,970
never been driven and in that to me

199
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,089
that's where we really go because once

200
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,400
we have a genetic basics you can't get

201
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:38,229
around it and so I know what the human

202
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,929
genome that when you have superior

203
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:43,180
genetics you can't you can't you can't

204
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,370
do it if you're genetically programmed

205
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,959
to be an Elon Musk intellectually you

206
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,189
can read every book on earth until you

207
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,469
die you're still not gonna have this

208
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:51,430
capacity and so I know that that's

209
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,220
really where we're gonna go with

210
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,079
cannabis is that I saw this and I've

211
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,970
been hunting varietals for age and

212
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,439
decades chasing varietals but I realized

213
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,850
that what I'm doing is I'm chasing and

214
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,459
I'm hunting and was sifting and we're

215
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,260
using but we could compress that period

216
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,149
and get a more accurate situation and

217
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,459
then start to really develop unique

218
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:14,829
product lines for the respective farms

219
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:16,989
and then develop unique lines based off

220
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:18,550
a location so indoors is so we can

221
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,560
certify it anywhere we want I can do

222
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,660
computer chips in Taiwan I can do

223
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,879
computer chips in Silicon Valley

224
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,800
st. chip because we can control the

225
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,779
variables in the facility but that's not

226
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,150
the truth with glass house and that's

227
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:32,470
not the truth without door because

228
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,029
you're gonna have environmental inputs

229
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,990
they're going to change it but no matter

230
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,759
what you do you're gonna have

231
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,680
fluctuations and so if you're high

232
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,729
desert or if you're a valley you're

233
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,139
gonna have radically different

234
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,090
situations that occur with your

235
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:44,710
production methodologies and the only

236
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,899
way to get around this to me is through

237
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,280
genomics because what it'll do is it

238
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,919
allow you to be able to reduce

239
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,750
infrastructure costs where it's not so

240
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:55,069
imperative to have so much cooling I'm

241
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,519
not slurring off my terpene profile

242
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,290
if I'm having variabilities in my BPD

243
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,620
it's okay because the vigor the plants

244
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:05,149
still going to work if I'm having

245
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,740
pathogenic problems I should be able to

246
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:08,299
have higher resistance if I can breathe

247
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,278
plants that have a tougher epidural

248
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:11,750
layer because that's what we see now we

249
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:13,669
see certain plants just like when you

250
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,230
run in silicone and high levels we can

251
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,539
get the epidural layer to toughen up so

252
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,889
the probiscus can't make it through well

253
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:22,698
why can't we do that on a genetic level

254
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:25,370
and then I got contacted from doctors in

255
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:27,258
Florida that had said hey do you want to

256
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,198
work on a project with developing

257
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:32,389
medical varieties in Florida and a lot

258
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:33,740
of it was specific chemo type profile so

259
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:37,730
they could use it for sublingual and

260
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,889
topical patch and they wanted to do it

261
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,509
in conventional methodology because all

262
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,680
this genomic stuff is brand new and so

263
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:44,778
not everybody's aware of it they're

264
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,149
aware of it for the human element but

265
00:09:44,778 --> 00:09:48,980
not for cannabis and the thing was we

266
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,600
were tying into a cilia Salinas

267
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,039
operation to go test through you know

268
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,170
hundreds of thousands of plants but I'm

269
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,480
like you're gonna miss them it's

270
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:58,969
impossible to pick the outlier when you

271
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,620
have that many plants and so what you

272
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,980
need to be able to do is use the genetic

273
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,230
testing procedures to start to locate

274
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,690
what you're seeking so then you can then

275
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:11,028
take that population and work with that

276
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,010
population if I can find the person

277
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:15,289
that's TB resistant and breed them I'll

278
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:17,838
get higher TV resistance if I can find

279
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:19,879
someone that has higher genetic levels

280
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,399
you see it in families where you see all

281
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,289
the athletes once there's a relative

282
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,690
somewhere who transferred some

283
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:29,750
phenomenal genetic material isolate that

284
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,040
person and reproduce that cap and that's

285
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,389
what we want to do with cannabis and

286
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,610
we're and we're about to it's happening

287
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:38,060
right now and so we started to work with

288
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,649
some crews out of Santa Cruz so we can

289
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:41,028
start to work with some of the lines out

290
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:45,289
of the cookie crew because we have

291
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:46,879
access through Parker Parker's partners

292
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:50,059
on the lemonade line with burner and

293
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:52,639
then it allows us to start to take some

294
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:55,188
of these highly branded varietals to

295
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,889
have exceptional velocity in the market

296
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:59,870
sift through them to find the true

297
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:02,480
production varietal and then you can

298
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,448
license them into into facilities that

299
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,409
can then sell this and so I have a large

300
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:07,519
manufacturing facility we're building

301
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:08,629
right now that's going to be designed

302
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,730
for Terps stripping

303
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:12,379
and so what you find is a lot of the

304
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,269
terpene profiles you've seen I've been

305
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:16,549
feeding these these companies Turk

306
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:18,490
sheets for years so it allows them to

307
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:20,449
take my data and put together

308
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,940
formulations to create plant-derived

309
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,980
tripping packages because it allows you

310
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,270
to have crude manufacturers help out and

311
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,860
what it does that lets me play with

312
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,069
other companies so I can understand what

313
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,000
you do so I I share my stuff I get data

314
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,710
back from you

315
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,330
it lets me keep myself moving

316
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,250
continuously or otherwise I would only

317
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,280
be me but if I can mess with enough

318
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,080
scientists and up other companies and we

319
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,720
keep our proprietary ship proprietorial

320
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,840
we work on joint projects it lets us do

321
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,879
better I don't give a shit what what

322
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,220
terpene profile you put together it is

323
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,649
not the same as a cannabis derived you

324
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,720
can't get the complexity straight and

325
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,399
you can't get the ratio straight and so

326
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,680
ultimately the the experience is

327
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,230
diminished so what we realized was that

328
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,149
if we put in commercial level

329
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,039
stripping operations I can then have

330
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:09,379
farmers who have locations that are

331
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,750
optimal for higher quality do my crude

332
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:13,519
production and then I can have farms

333
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,559
that have better situations to do my

334
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,289
Turk production and then I take your

335
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,509
cannabis I pull the Terps the rest of

336
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:22,099
the flower gets blown as crude so this

337
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,529
way you make crude money you make Turk

338
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,540
money the Terps now can get infused with

339
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:29,769
the crude from others because you're

340
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:32,809
you're having a radical amount of

341
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:35,659
product that can be created from serbian

342
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:38,479
infusion and so it starts to let me find

343
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:40,009
how do we stabilize markets and for me a

344
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,070
lot of it is that I've been in Humboldt

345
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,529
for almost thirty years and I don't have

346
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,030
any intention belief but what I see is a

347
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,399
tremendous number of people that were

348
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,259
phenomenal career cultivators but

349
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,899
they're not technologically aware

350
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:55,100
because they didn't have to be it isn't

351
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,059
that they're not smart enough they're

352
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,740
fucking brilliant

353
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,479
it's just that they've been very focused

354
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,330
on what they do so they're biologically

355
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,550
intelligent they're cultivar intelligent

356
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:08,570
and they understand how to produce using

357
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:10,849
their specifical location and that makes

358
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,260
them vulnerable and so for me what I've

359
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,509
been doing for a long time is I gather

360
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:16,429
these hot varietals I get access to a

361
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:19,129
number of number companies these

362
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:20,479
companies allow me to take the variety

363
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:22,070
sure so I got to hold it a cookie like

364
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,550
nine years ago and I was the first one

365
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,860
to put it in

366
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:26,659
broad-scale production and what it did

367
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,000
was in and it was allowed because

368
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:30,829
ultimately you can't build a true brand

369
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,110
a true market if you don't have a

370
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,509
million people using it if only ten of

371
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,850
us have it and only a thousand people

372
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:41,419
consume it that's not a real product

373
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,860
it's very niche and so for years I've

374
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:44,719
been receiving products from breeders

375
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,360
that said hey listen take this product

376
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,070
from us and move it because my nursery

377
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,139
focused primarily on black market

378
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,310
operations where it was legitimate so

379
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,250
you had to come in with a driver's

380
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:57,528
license in a 2:15 but I influenced up to

381
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,759
maybe the BOE figured that I was doing

382
00:13:57,528 --> 00:14:00,789
anyway between one hundred fifty two

383
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,200
hundred seventy-five million a year in

384
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:04,490
influence in the system they stuff of

385
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,839
what was occurrence over the last five

386
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,370
years I might influence the billion

387
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,860
dollars a cannabis production through

388
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,909
the United States breeders recognize

389
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,730
that because they go everything you

390
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:15,799
touch blows up in other regions because

391
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,600
I do my research over the whole United

392
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,009
States to find out what's in demand and

393
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,389
then I take a look and then when you

394
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:23,480
would come in and speak to me I'd say

395
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:25,039
listen I'm not gonna rat you out so

396
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,420
people would give me the answer I'd say

397
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,429
what's your market and you'd be like

398
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:29,870
look I'm moving it to these coasts so we

399
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:31,219
would find cultivars that move in that

400
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,019
hot direction and then I would have

401
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,269
sifted out cultivars that work on the

402
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:37,250
production level for you and so what it

403
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:38,449
does it allows you is the the cultivator

404
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,820
to have a better level of success

405
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,379
because you can move your product and it

406
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,020
lets me have plenty of people to play

407
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:47,269
with to play the are indie game and it

408
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:50,120
lets me test my hypothesis am i accurate

409
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:51,588
with my market analysis and and you need

410
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,509
it you need to be able to figure out are

411
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,490
you on point and you can you can believe

412
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:57,139
you're on point but when you're moving

413
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,810
that much material you know you're on

414
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,429
point and so it allows you to reconfirm

415
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:02,989
your hypothesis because you have to

416
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:05,859
prove it twice in order to make it real

417
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:08,360
and so it lets me function in that level

418
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,699
and what I wanted to be able to see is

419
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,769
the development of varietals that work

420
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:15,198
in the microclimates of humble county in

421
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:17,600
these low-lying areas that have higher

422
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,819
humidity levels that have a longer

423
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,860
season up to where I am up in the

424
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,570
mountains where I have ungodly

425
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,190
production capacity and quality but with

426
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,860
a shorter season because the temperature

427
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,480
range is a little more aggressive and

428
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,009
then we started to mess around with some

429
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,750
of the new indoor facilities that were

430
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:35,120
popping up and it's the same thing I

431
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,139
feed into our people now but we want to

432
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,879
say hey

433
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:39,799
let's get varieties that work under your

434
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,330
lighting systems let's get them that

435
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,729
work under these environmental

436
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,860
conditions what works optimally in rock

437
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,200
wool what works optimally in cocoa and

438
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,450
we start to mark those varietals that

439
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,890
are that are outliers within it and we

440
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,500
start to take a look at it and say hey

441
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:56,659
these are the markers we see on those

442
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,549
plants and now you can start to go

443
00:15:56,659 --> 00:16:00,500
through your breeding projects pull out

444
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:02,929
the outliers do the work

445
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,779
fill out the gradient and now you really

446
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:07,879
have a product distribution that

447
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:08,990
actually makes sense when you're talking

448
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,399
about the you know and I don't want to

449
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,200
knock any of these companies because

450
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,929
they I don't want it I don't thank

451
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,520
people on taper in either not shank yet

452
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:19,189
but it doesn't make any goddamn sense

453
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,439
it's arbitrary and so you're you're

454
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,330
having an opportunity to develop an

455
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,520
industry so we've been in this forever

456
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,250
so cannabis is going on in the US since

457
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,919
fuck the sixties but right now it's

458
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,809
actually changing into this very

459
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,729
accepted model so you're gonna have this

460
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:36,229
incredible increase in people coming in

461
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,879
and you're gonna bout to start having

462
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,560
global trading coming in so I'm getting

463
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:41,870
hit up from every country on earth to go

464
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,459
play so I know this stuff is is at a

465
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,669
level that's nothing like we've ever

466
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,800
seen and how do we start to develop

467
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:52,039
product lines that actually make sense

468
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,990
that you could own yourself licensed and

469
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:59,179
sell the other facilities around the

470
00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:01,840
world as licensed product you want to

471
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:01,839
hold your product
